    "des": "\"A super canap\u00c3\u00a9 for an elegant brunch or dinner party. Light buckwheat blinis are topped with a classic combo of smoked salmon, sour cream and fresh dill. Start the blinis early because they need a few hours to rise.\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve yeast in warm milk in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Stir in buckwheat flour and sugar; cover with a towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nWhisk all-purpose flour, eggs, heavy whipping cream, sour cream, and salt into buckwheat mixture until smooth batter forms. Cover with a towel and let stand until batter is frothy and doubled in volume again, about 2 hours.\nHeat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over high heat. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto skillet; cook until small bubbles rise to the top and edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until evenly browned on other side, about 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.\nTop each blini with 1 salmon strip, a teaspoon-sized dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of dill.",
