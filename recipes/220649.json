    "des": "\"I don't normally like hush puppies. They are generally too dry, too dense, and too bland for my taste. After tasting some in a restaurant that I actually liked, I decided to come up with a recipe of my own. This one deliberately uses stuff right out of the pantry so that it can be whipped up quickly and served fast.\"",
    "ins": "Mix corn muffin mix, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl until blended.\nStir eggs and evaporated milk into dry ingredients until moistened.\nStir cream-style corn into mixture to make a moist batter. Let batter stand while oil heats.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nGently drop a teaspoon of batter at a time into the hot oil, staying as close to the oil as possible to avoid splattering. Fry hush puppies until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch.\nRemove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with salt if desired.",
