    "ins": "Preheat a grill for medium heat.\nIn a large bowl, combine the ground beef, raisins, onion, garlic, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Mix lightly using your hands, then divide into 6 portions. Flatten each portion into a patty.\nPlace burgers on the grill and cook for about 7 minutes per side, or until well done. If you do not wish to grill, fry patties in a skillet over medium heat.  Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.",
