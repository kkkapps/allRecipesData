    "ins": "Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and then dredge in 1/2 cup flour.  In a skillet over medium heat, lightly brown chops in a small  amount of oil.\nPlace chops in slow cooker, and top with onion slices.  Dissolve bouillon cubes in boiling water and pour over chops.  Cover, and cook on Low 7 to 8 hours.\nPreheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nAfter the chops have cooked, transfer chops to the oven to keep warm. Be careful, the chops are so tender they will fall apart. In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons flour with the sour cream; mix into meat juices.  Turn slow cooker to High for 15 to 30 minutes, or until sauce is slightly thickened.  Serve sauce over pork chops.",
