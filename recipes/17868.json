    "ins": "In a large bowl combine the chicken, bread crumbs, 2 eggs and onion and mix well; if mixture is too dry to form patties, mix in another lightly beaten egg. Then add parsley, salt and pepper to taste, mix well and form into small patties.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and fry patties in oil until golden brown.",
