    "des": "\"This main dish stars chicken marinated in tequila that's then grilled, and topped with Texas Bean Salsa and splashed with lime juice. Apple juice can be substituted for the tequila if you choose, and the chicken can also be broiled.\"",
    "ins": "To make the salsa, mix the black beans, black-eyed peas, corn, red onion, bell pepper, chiles, and tomatoes together in a bowl. Toss vegetables with the Italian dressing, cilantro, garlic, and garlic salt until evenly blended. Cover, and refrigerate 6 hours or overnight.\nPreheat a grill for medium-high heat.\nAbout 45 minutes before serving time, place the chicken breasts in a baking dish and drizzle with lime juice and tequila. Sprinkle evenly with paprika, salt, and pepper. Cover the dish, refrigerate, and allow to marinate 10 minutes.\nRemove chicken breasts from the marinade, and discard remaining marinade.\nCook the chicken breasts on the preheated grill until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink, 10 to 12 minutes.\nTo serve, place a lettuce leaf on each plate. Top with a chicken breast, and spoon Texas Bean Salsa over each, dividing evenly among servings. If desired, garnish with additional cilantro leaves and lime wedges.",
