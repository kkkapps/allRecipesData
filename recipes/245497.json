    "des": "\"This is one of many Ethiopian dishes. It is a typical dish that is served alongside other dishes on injera. It's very simple and tastes great. There are many variations on this recipe; it can be prepared with just the cabbage, with carrots and potatoes, with meat, and so on.\"",
    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a pot over medium heat. Add onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, garlic, turmeric, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until flavors are combined, about 7 minutes. Add cabbage and mix well.\nCover pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the cabbage is tender but not completely soft, about 20 minutes. Add water if vegetables look dry.",
