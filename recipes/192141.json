    "ins": "Place cucumber slices into a colander in the sink and lightly sprinkle with salt, tossing to coat. Allow cucumber to drain for 30 minutes. Gently shake the colander to remove any excess liquid and transfer cucumber to a large bowl. Stir in rice vinegar and honey, making sure to coat each cucumber slice evenly. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Toss cucumber and return to the refrigerator for an additional hour. Serve chilled.",
