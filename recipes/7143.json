    "des": "\"This is an old Slovak recipe.  In Slovak it is called Roshky.  The rolls are filled with lekvar, a thick, soft fruit spread.  This is an all day project.  This recipe will make 7 or 8 twelve inch loaves, or some dough may be reserved for lekvar squares.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare two fillings.  Mix together walnuts, 1 cup sugar, and 1/ 8 teaspoon cinnamon.  In a separate bowl, mix lekvar with lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.\nIn a large bowl, combine 1 cup sugar, 2 cups butter or margarine, and 6 eggs.  Mix well.  Add sour cream, milk, flour, yeast, and salt.  Beat thoroughly until dough does not stick to hands.\nForm dough into 7 or 8 balls.  Roll out each ball on a lightly floured board to a rectangle.\nBrush dough with melted butter.  Fill with fillings.  Roll tight.  Place on greased pans, and let stand for approximately 4 hours to raise before baking.\nBrush tops with beaten egg yolk just before placing in oven.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.",
