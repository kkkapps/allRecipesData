    "des": "\"This dish is a little different than a traditional tetrazzini. It has no mushrooms and is made with cheese, onion, bell pepper, soup, and Worcestershire. No one eats this and leaves my house without the recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken thighs into a large saucepan, pour in water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until chicken is tender and no longer pink inside, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain, retaining chicken stock.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCook and stir green bell pepper and onion in 1 cup retained stock in a saucepan over medium heat until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Cook vermicelli pasta with remaining 2 cups chicken stock in a separate pan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender and stock has been absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes.\nCombine cooked chicken, bell pepper, onion, cooked pasta, cream of mushroom soup, Worcestershire sauce, Cheddar cheese, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl; pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and top is lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.",
