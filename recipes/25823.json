Press the mixture into the bottom of an ungreased 9x9 inch baking pan.\nBake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm and golden. Set aside to cool.\nPour cold water into a medium saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir in the white sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and gelatin. When the mixture is clear, remove from heat and stir in the confectioners' sugar. Set aside until cool.\nWhen the mixture has cooled to luke warm, stir in the baking powder, vanilla and almond extracts and any color of food coloring. Beat at high speed with an electric mixer until the mixture can hold a peak. Pour over the shortbread base and cool until the gloss disappears. Cut into 36 squares and enjoy!",
