    "des": "\"Brunches are a big hit in our family.  They think this recipe makes the best waffles of all and it is easily doubled or tripled.  I sprinkle blueberries or pecans on top of the batter for those who want them just before closing the waffle iron --- it's definitely my favorite way to have them. Plus, you can make the batter the night before!\"",
