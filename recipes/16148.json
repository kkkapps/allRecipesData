    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat.\nPlace tuna in a glass dish. Prepare the vinaigrette by whisking together the wine, olive oil, red wine vinegar, rosemary, pepper, salt and garlic. Pour 2 tablespoons over fish and turn to coat. Marinate 15 to 30 minutes, turning once. Reserve remaining vinaigrette for salad dressing.\nCoat grill rack with cooking spray and place on grill to heat 1 minute. Place tuna on grill 4 to 6 inches over hot coals. Cover with lid or tent with foil. Cook, turning once, just until tuna begins to flake easily when tested with a fork, about 7 minutes. Discard marinade.\nArrange salad greens on 4 plates. Place hot tuna on greens and add cherry tomatoes. Stir remaining vinaigrette and drizzle over salads.",
