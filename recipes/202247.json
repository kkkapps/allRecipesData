Add the spinach, portabella mushrooms, and yellow bell pepper, stir a few times, cover with lid, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook the mixture until the spinach and mushrooms give up their liquid and the peppers are softened, about 4 minutes.\nUncover the skillet, and pour in the pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar. Increase the heat to medium, and let the mixture cook down and thicken slightly, about 2 minutes.\nSpoon the hot mushroom mixture onto the split hoagie roll, and serve.",
