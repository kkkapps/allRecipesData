Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl.\nMix the milk and vinegar in a large bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes to sour the milk. Beat in the butter, sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract. Stir the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture until just combined. Fold in the zucchini. Pour batter into the prepared pan, and sprinkle with chocolate chips.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
