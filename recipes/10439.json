    "des": "\" I used to make these cookies for my kids 30 years ago.  We called them \"No Peeks\" because peeking before they were ready would have ruined them. It was always a ceremony for the kids because I'd put them in the oven just before they went to bed. In the morning the cookies would be \"miraculously\" all done. Use any color of food coloring you desire.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a cookie sheet.\nBeat egg whites until fluffy.  Add salt and cream of tartar. Adding sugar gradually, continue to beat until egg whites are stiff and will stand.  Fold in desired food coloring, peppermint extract and chocolate chips.\nDrop by teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet, put in oven and turn oven OFF.  Leave in oven undisturbed several hours or overnight.  Do not open oven once cookies have been put in or they will be soggy, not crisp and airy.  NO PEEK!",
