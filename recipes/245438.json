    "des": "\"DIY flax seed milk can not only save money but also keep you from using the store-bought kind with chemicals and additives. Adjusting the amount of water used can also produce a thicker outcome giving you a creamier texture to use in place of cream in recipes.\"",
    "ins": "Blend flax seeds and water in a blender on high for 1 minute; allow to rest for 2 minutes. Blend again on high for 1 minute; allow to rest for 5 minutes. Blend again for 30 seconds.\nPour milk through a nut bag or a strainer lined with cheesecloth into a pitcher or glass container; press solids with back of a spoon to extract liquid. Gather cheesecloth around solids; twist and squeeze to extract all the liquid.",
