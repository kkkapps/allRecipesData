Drain, crumble and set aside.\nIn a large bowl, combine the lettuce, red bell pepper, green onions and corn, and mix together. Carefully stir in the cubed avocado.\nIn a separate small bowl, whisk together the red wine and vinegar dressing, the blue cheese dressing, and the honey.\nPour the dressing mixture over the salad and toss.  Add bacon just before serving to keep it crunchy.",
