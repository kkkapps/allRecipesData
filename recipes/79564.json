    "des": "\"Yummy sweet potato biscuits that rival Steamer's biscuits in Chincoteague, Virginia.  You'll taste no better than this! My family hates sweet potatoes, but they snatch these up every time I make them!  You could also substitute pumpkin for the sweet potato and cardamom for the nutmeg.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nInto a large bowl, sift together the flour, wheat germ, baking powder, and salt. Mix in butter, evaporated milk, sweet potatoes, milk, and nutmeg, stirring by hand until dough is smooth.\nOn a lightly floured board, roll out the dough until it is about 1/2-inch thick. With a sharp knife, cut into 3-inch squares or diamonds. Place squares on greased baking sheet, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm.",
