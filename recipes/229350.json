    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nPlace chicken breast halves into prepared baking dish. Whisk lemon juice, honey, olive oil, garlic, and oregano together in a bowl and pour the mixture over chicken breasts.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink inside, the juices run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Baste chicken with pan juices every 15 minutes while baking.",
