Cook and stir until no longer pink, about 10 minutes.\nDrain off some of the grease, and stir in the onions and bell pepper. Cook until soft, then add the garlic. Season with cumin, chili powder, oregano, paprika, cayenne and cinnamon. Cook and stir for about one minute to release the fragrance. Pour the tomatoes and beef stock into the pan, along with the sugar. Set the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.\nStir the raisins, olives, capers and vinegar into the pan, and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes.
