    "des": "\"Delicious, truly guilt-free cookies with the strong, tasty flavors of ginger, honey, and orange that blend like a party in your mouth! If your store does not carry fruit-based fat substitute, you can easily substitute pureed prunes, or prune baby food in an equal amount.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nPlace half of the oats, and half of the triticale into a blender or food processor, and grind into a fine powder. Transfer to a medium bowl, and combine with the remaining oats, triticale, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the fat substitute, honey, and sucrolose sweetener until smooth. Mix in the vanilla and orange zest. Add the dry ingredients, and mix until well blended. Finally, stir in the chopped candied ginger and cranberries. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. Cookies should be spaced at least 2 inches apart.\nBake for 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are golden. Cool on baking sheets for at least 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
