    "des": "\"A sweet and tangy, affordable and easy recipe. Simple and loaded with veggies. Does not have an overpowering flavor, kid approved. Browning pork chops is an important step, don't skip! I add meat tenderizer to any slow cooker meat, you do not need to add salt, the tenderizer and broth add plenty. Use fresh ground nutmeg! Great with boiled potatoes alongside.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown outsides of the pork chops thoroughly, about 5 minutes per side.\nMix together the apple juice, cider vinegar, chicken broth, brown sugar, meat tenderizer, garlic powder, nutmeg, ginger, and black pepper in a slow cooker, stirring until the brown sugar has dissolved. Place the pork chops into the liquid. Top the chops with apple, onion, and cabbage. Set the cooker on Low; cook 4 to 5 hours, turning the chops over in the sauce once or twice. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
