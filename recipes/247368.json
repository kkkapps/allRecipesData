    "des": "\"The subtle flavours of turkey sausage, blended together with sauteed onion and garlic, make these burgers moist and flavourful. Great on a bun or on their own. Enjoy with your favourite toppings.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir onion and garlic until soft and fragrant, about 3 minutes; remove from heat.\nStir ground turkey, turkey sausage, egg, parsley, onion mixture, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Use an ice cream scoop to measure 8 equal portions; pat each portion gently into a burger shape.\nPan fry the burgers in a large skillet over medium-low heat until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the burgers should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees F).",
