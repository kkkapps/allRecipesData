    "des": "\"This is an easy to make recipe. I've tried numerous others using colas, fancy pans, etc., but none come out near as good as this. Keeping it simple is the best way. Be sure to use a high-quality charcoal, so that it will burn for a long time. Turkey will be moist tender and smoky!\"",
    "ins": "Place the charcoal into the bottom pan of the smoker. Light the coals and wait for the temperature of the smoker to come to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C). Lightly oil grate.\nRinse turkey under cold water, and pat dry. Place hickory chips into a pan with water to cover.\nPlace turkey onto the prepared grate. Add 2 handfuls damp chips at start of cooking, then a handful every couple of hours during the cooking process. Leave the lid on - DO NOT keep looking at the turkey, or you will let the heat out! Continue smoking until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), or keep going until the coals die out.",
