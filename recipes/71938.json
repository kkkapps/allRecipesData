    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the spelt flour, whole wheat flour, oats, yeast, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, ginger and salt. Combine the oil, warm water, and 1/4 cup maple syrup; stir into the flour mixture.\nWhen the dough is stiff enough, turn out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 7 minutes. Knead in more flour if necessary to keep the dough from being sticky. Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat. Cover, and set in a warm place to rise until double in size.\nPunch down dough, and form into a tight ball by folding the sides into the center. The tighter the ball, the more it will rise instead of just spreading. Place on a greased baking sheet with the seam underneath. Let rise for 20 minutes, or until your finger leaves a dent when you poke it gently.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix together 3 tablespoon of water and 1 tablespoon of maple syrup. Brush over the top of the loaf, then sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of oats.\nBake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack before slicing.",
