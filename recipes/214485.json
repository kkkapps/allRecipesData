    "ins": "Stir the basmati rice, water, green onions, salt, and pepper together in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Stir in the butter. Reduce heat to low, cover the pan, and let simmer for 15 minutes. When the rice has steam openings in the top between the grains, stir in the lemon juice. Cover and let sit off the heat for 10 minutes to finish steaming.\nTo serve, place 4 spinach leaves in a fan shape on a plate; scoop up several balls of rice using an ice cream scoop. Place the rice scoops decoratively onto the spinach leaves, and serve.",
