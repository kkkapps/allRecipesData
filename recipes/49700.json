    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll out the bread dough into a rectangle, and spread out on a baking sheet greased with olive oil. Set aside.\nPlace potato slices in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 5 minutes. Add bacon slices to the water, and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Drain. Remove bacon, then dice.\nWhile the potatoes and bacon cook, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook, stirring until tender. Remove from heat and stir in cream; season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.\nSpread the onion mixture over the bread dough. Arrange potato slices evenly, and sprinkle with bacon.\nBake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is golden on the bottom. Let stand for a few minutes before slicing.",
