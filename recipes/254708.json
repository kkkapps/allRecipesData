    "des": "\"This vegan cheese tastes like cheese and has a strong cheese aftertaste. The glutinous flour creates the firm and slightly chewy texture of melted cheese. The flax seeds creates its slimy quality. \n\nThe cheese will always stay melted and will not harden. The top of the cheese can dry and solidify if toasted. \n\nIt can be used for macaroni and cheese, fondue, toasts, pasta sauce, lasagna, burgers, sandwiches, cheese fries. You can put the mixture in a piping bag and squeeze it over the top of pizza to form random streaks of cheese over the toppings.\"",
    "ins": "Mix water, chickpea flour, rice flour, nutritional yeast, and flax seeds in a saucepan until dissolved. Add oil, onion, and garlic.\nPlace saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until mixture is the consistency of melted cheese, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
