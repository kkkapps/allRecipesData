    "des": "\"This has ground turkey, salsa, corn, great Northern beans and jalapeno pepper-jack cheese. I requested this recipe from my co-worker after she brought it into one of our many potlucks. It is very tasty and a little spicy; if you don't like it spicy, cut the amount of cheese in half--it will still have a little kick! This recipe is really easy, and even the pickiest eaters will love it.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot or saucepan, combine the browned turkey, salsa, corn, water, beans and cheese. Stir together and simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes, or until cheese has melted and chili is hot.",
