Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, stir into the oatmeal mixture. Fold in the coconut, 1 cup of the chocolate chips and the nuts. Pour into the prepared pan, and sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips over the top.\nBake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cake springs back when lightly touched.",
