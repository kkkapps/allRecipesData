    "des": "\"My grandmother is from Mississippi. I call these her 'soul food' pancakes because she grew up at a time when people who had very little made simple meals taste super delicious. Every Sunday before church, she made these pancakes to get us out of bed. They have a crepe like texture but are still pancakes and are delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; saute plantains until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer plantains to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.\nBeat egg in a large bowl until fluffy. Stir milk and margarine into egg; add flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir mixture until batter is smooth. Fold plantains into batter.\nMelt 1 teaspoon butter in a heavy griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Griddle is ready with a drop of water breaks into several smaller balls that dance around griddle. Pour batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, into hot griddle. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
