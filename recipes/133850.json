    "des": "\"This is an easy, quick, and impressive dish with a sweet and aromatic flavors from the apricots and spices.  Be sure to use unsulfured apricots!  The color is darker and the flavor is more complex, really giving depth and life to the dish. Serve over couscous or quinoa and top it all off with some toasted pine nuts.  Yum!\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken thighs on both sides until golden, about 3 minutes per side. Set chicken aside, then stir in onion and garlic; cook for 1 to 2 minutes until the onion has softened. Stir in apricots and season with ginger, cumin, and allspice. Cook for 1 minute until spices are fragrant.\nPour beer into pan, scraping the bottom of the pan to dissolve the browned bits. Add chicken, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently until the chicken begins to fall away from the bone, about 30 minutes.",
