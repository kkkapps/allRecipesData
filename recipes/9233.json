You can make it vegan by deleting the mushroom soup and increasing the broth, also use no/low fat soup if you like. Multi-grain, nut and sourdough breads all work great.  Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.  Pecans can be substituted for walnuts.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together the bread, cream of mushroom soup, vegetable broth, water, poultry seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste. Add any or all of the optional ingredients as desired. It will be sticky. Shape into a loaf and wrap in (nonstick, sprayed) foil to bake.\nBake for about an hour at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). You can slice it like a meatloaf and serve.",
