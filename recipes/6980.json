    "ins": "In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the milk, the butter or margarine, 4 cups of the flour and the salt; stir until well combined. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.\nLightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nDeflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.\nMist loaves with water and bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven for 20 to 30  minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped.",
