    "des": "\"This is my Grandmother's traditional Yorkshire pudding recipe. She's been using it since before I can remember, and they always turn out perfectly! Crispy golden brown on the outside, and a fluffy tender inside. Fill with your favorite gravy, and you have an instant crowd pleaser! Goes great with roasts or with holiday turkeys.\"",
    "ins": "Mix flour, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl; make a deep well in the center of flour mixture. Break eggs into the well and beat until smooth.\nMix milk and water together in a small bowl; slowly stir milk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, into flour mixture until batter is a thin, paste-like consistency. Cover bowl and allow batter to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with butter, using 1/2 teaspoon butter per muffin cup.\nPlace muffin tin on the second shelf from the top in the preheated oven until butter melts and begins to smoke, 3 to 4 minutes.\nWhisk the batter to fully incorporate all the ingredients, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the melted butter in each muffin tin, 1/2 to 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until puddings are golden brown and well-risen, keeping the oven door closed the entire time of cooking, 17 to 20 minutes.",
