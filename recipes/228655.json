    "des": "\"An easy, cheesy homemade beer soup. Great fall comfort food! The blending part might seem annoying, but it makes the soup velvety smooth. Serve with bread, sour cream, shredded Cheddar, and/or bacon bits.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken broth, potatoes, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Stir milk into the mixture, place over medium heat, and simmer until warm, about 5 minutes; add soy sauce and black pepper. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese into the soup in small batches while stirring, allowing each addition to melt into the soup before adding more.\nPour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return blended soup to the saucepan; return to a simmer over medium heat.\nSlowly stream beer into the soup while gently stirring. Garnish with paprika to serve.",
