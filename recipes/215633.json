    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Grease a baking sheet.\nSlice the tofu and polenta into slabs of equal thickness; brush with olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet.\nCook the tofu and polenta under the preheated broiler until the tops are crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.\nHeat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the bananas in the oil until crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside, about 5 minutes. Remove the bananas from the oil and set aside.\nPour the entire can of black beans into a blender and blend until a thick sauce forms.\nStir the mango, diced onion, jalapeno pepper, and salt together in a small bowl.\nTo build the arepas, place a slice of polenta on each of four plates and top each with first about 1/4 of the bean sauce, then a piece of tofu, a few slices of banana, some avocado, and finishing with about  1/4 of the mango salsa.",
