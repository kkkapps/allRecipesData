    "des": "\"For simplicity, keep it on the cob. To make it special, cook it twice: first in the microwave, then in a skillet till the ears turn golden-brown. Instead of butter, pass this chili-lime-cilantro sour cream. Unlike butter, sour cream adheres to the kernels, and its rich tartness is a pleasant contrast to the sweet corn.\"",
    "ins": "Place corn on a microwave-safe plate; cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave on high power until corn is fully cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. (Leaving plastic wrap in place, corn can be made up to 2 hours ahead.)\nMix sour cream, cilantro, chili powder, lime juice, salt and pepper. Cover and chill until ready to serve. (Makes 1/2 cup.)\nAbout 10 minutes before serving time, heat butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add corn and cook, turning with kitchen tongs every few minutes, until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Serve immediately, with sour cream spread passed separately.",
