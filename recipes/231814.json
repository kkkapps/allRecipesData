    "ins": "Place tilapia fillets on plate and sprinkle with salt and hot sauce; cover and refrigerate while making cilantro cream sauce.\nCombine cream cheese, 2 tablespoons cilantro, mayonnaise, and yogurt in a small bowl or large measuring cup; mix well. Stir lime juice into cream sauce. Cover and refrigerate.\nWhisk flour, salt, garlic powder, cayenne, and pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined; whisk in beer to make a smooth batter.\nHeat oil in a large, deep frying pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRemove fish from refrigerator; dip in beer batter and fry fillets 3 at a time in the hot oil, turning when golden (approximately 2 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness). Transfer to paper towels to drain; set fish on a covered plate to keep warm. Repeat with remaining fillets.\nWrap tortillas in a clean kitchen towel and heat in the microwave until warm, about 20 seconds. Assemble tacos by placing a fish fillet on a warm tortilla. Top with shredded cabbage, a dollop of cilantro cream sauce, a spoonful of salsa, and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro. Serve each taco with a lime quarter for squeezing.",
