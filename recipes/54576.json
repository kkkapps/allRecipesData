    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef, and cook, stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Mix in the crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, and bay leaves. Simmer for 25 minutes over low heat.\nMeanwhile, place the rice into a saucepan with enough water to cover by one inch. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10 minutes (halfway), then drain off water.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nRemove the bay leaves from the sauce, and mix in the half-cooked rice. Stir in the basil, mint, eggs, and mozzarella cheese; season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top.\nBake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed.",
