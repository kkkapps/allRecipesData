    "des": "\"If you like a great broth-based soup this is it. The juices from the oxtail make it different from any other meat soups. You can use different vegetables in it or the the ones in the recipe to your taste. Very easy to make if you have the time to spare. Perfect for a winter-time meal. \nServe with corn tortillas or bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nPlace oxtail in a baking dish and sprinkle seasoned salt over oxtail.\nRoast oxtail in a baking dish until well-browned, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven, reserving any drippings in baking dish.\nHeat beef broth, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, onion, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, bouillon, cumin, red pepper, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper together over medium heat in a large stockpot. Add oxtail and reserved drippings to soup; pour in water to fill stockpot halfway.\nSimmer soup, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.",
