    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a small bowl, beat egg with milk. In a shallow plate or bowl, mix bread crumbs with Italian seasonings. Dip each piece of chicken into the egg/milk mixture, then into the bread crumb mixture to coat thoroughly.\nPlace coated chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, depending on how thick the chicken breasts are (bake until chicken is done and juices run clear). In the last 3 to 4 minutes of baking, sprinkle the top of the chicken pieces with cheese. Remove from oven and serve!",
