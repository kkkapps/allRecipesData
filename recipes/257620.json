This is so versatile, feel free to add leftover roasted chicken, bacon bits, steak, or even roasted vegetables. Generally, I do not measure any of the ingredients so do not hold true to my measurements below.\"",

Massage kale pieces with your hands until slightly softened; spread over quinoa. Layer tomatoes, avocado, cucumber, red onion, and green bell pepper over kale. Drizzle dressing on top. Garnish with goat cheese.",
