Check occasionally and add more water if needed. Drain and set aside to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.\nIn the bowl of a food processor, combine the onion, carrot, bell pepper and wheat germ. Pulse until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl. Put the lentils into the food processor and process into a paste. Spoon the lentils into the bowl with the vegetables and mix in the rice, bread crumbs, flax seed, egg whites, tomato sauce and olive oil. Season with thyme, cayenne pepper and salt. Spoon the mixture into the prepared loaf pan.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through and browned on the top. Cool slightly before slicing and serving.",
