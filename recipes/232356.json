    "des": "\"This is a pantry-friendly recipe for custard-style chocolate ice cream. No heavy cream or corn starch is necessary and it's successful with 2% milk, yet the results are still creamy and smooth! A digital kitchen thermometer is highly recommended while cooking to ensure you've reached the proper cooking temperature.\"",
    "ins": "Fill sink with several inches of ice water.\nBeat eggs and cocoa powder in a bowl until well-blended and smooth.\nHeat milk, evaporated milk, sugar, and cocoa powder mixture in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until custard comes to 180 degrees F (82 degrees C), about 10 minutes. The custard should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nRemove saucepan from heat and immediately transfer to sink to halt cooking. Continue to stir custard until cooled; stir in vanilla extract.\nPour custard into an ice cream maker once it reaches 40 degrees F (4 degrees C). Freeze according to manufacturer's directions until softly frozen. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer at least 2 hours to overnight.",
