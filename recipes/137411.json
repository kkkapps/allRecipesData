Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and barbeque sauce. Bring to a simmer, then turn heat to low and keep warm until the tofu is ready.\nWhen tofu has finished baking, pour the hot barbeque sauce overtop, then return to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes.",
