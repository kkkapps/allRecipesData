    "des": "\"I formulated this to use some of the excessive quantity of rhubarb from the garden, without having to bake yet another pie. It has a very tart, lemony flavor which complements pork particularly well. Should keep for several weeks in the refrigerator.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread rhubarb, onion, and garlic on a baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven until tender, about 15 minutes.\nTransfer roasted rhubarb, onion, and garlic to a blender; puree until very smooth.\nPour rhubarb puree into a large pot. Stir in beer, brown sugar, ketchup, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, liquid smoke, salt, cinnamon, and cayenne. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves and flavors combine, about 15 minutes.",
