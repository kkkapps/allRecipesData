    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until completely browned, about 10 minutes; remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel to drain.\nSpread pesto over the pizza crust to cover in a thin layer to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Sprinkle about 1/2 the mozzarella cheese over the pesto. Arrange bacon pieces and pear slices atop the cheese; dot with crumbled goat cheese and top with remaining mozzarella cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted, 9 to 10 minutes.",
