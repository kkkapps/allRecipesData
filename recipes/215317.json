Place about 1/4 of the pumpkin into the bottom of a slow cooker, and sprinkle with 1/4 of the sugar mixture; repeat layers 3 more times. Cover the slow cooker, set it on Low, then cook for 8 hours or overnight. Stir once or twice during cooking. When the pumpkin is a dark, golden color, place an immersion blender into the slow cooker, and blend the pumpkin butter until smooth.",
