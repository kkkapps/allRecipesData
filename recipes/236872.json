    "des": "\"This simple pot roast makes its own gravy in the slow cooker. As a single parent to girls, I am always trying to get the food groups into my abbreviated meals. I threw in potatoes, carrots, yellow squash, and zucchini to add to the original base recipe. They love stew, so this leads them in that direction, but is still a roast. It was a hit. I hope you enjoy it!\"",
    "ins": "Stir cream of mushroom soup, water, and dry onion soup mix together in a slow cooker. Set pot roast into the soup mixture and spoon liquid over the meat. Add potatoes, carrots, yellow squash, and zucchini.\nCook on High until the beef is cooked through, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). You can also cook on Low for 5 to 6 hours.",
