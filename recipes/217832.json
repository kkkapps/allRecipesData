    "des": "\"This is a salad my great grandma use to make and is one of my favorites to eat during the holiday season.  Most people make this creamy by melting the cream cheese or dissolving it in the juice.  We actually add small chunks of the cheese after the mix has cooled.  So you have a clear gelatin with little white chunks in it.  So good!\"",
    "ins": "Drain the pineapple juice and cherry water into a 2-cup measuring cup. Pour enough color to make 2 cups; discard the remaining soda. Pour the cola mixture into a saucepan.\nBring the cola mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, then stir in the pineapple, cherries, cream cheese, and cherry gelatin until gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a mold or glass baking dish. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.",
