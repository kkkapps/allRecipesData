    "des": "\"A wonderful hearty pumpkin bread made in the machine. I make it every Thanksgiving. It's not like your usual pumpkin breads (sweet breads) made for dessert, it's more a serve-with-the-meal kind of bread.\"",
    "ins": "Combine flour, yeast, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, salt, butter, pumpkin puree, water, and brandy in the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.\nSelect the Sweet or Basic/White cycle using the Light crust setting and start the machine. (To make the bread without a bread machine, see Editor's Note.)\nWhen the bread is done baking, remove it from the pan and allow to cool on a wire rack.",
