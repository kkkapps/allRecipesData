    "des": "\"We made this recipe in third grade and the teacher sent a copy of the recipe home. I loved it so much I insisted my Mom make it, too. Ever since then it's become a Thanksgiving tradition each year. It has lasted the test of time because now I'm a mother of a third grader and we still make it! The pie requires no baking! And kids love it because it's made of ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the brown sugar, salt, pumpkin and cinnamon. Mix in the softened ice cream until well blended. Spoon into the pie crusts and place them in the freezer. Freeze for at least 3 hours before serving.",
