    "des": "\"This is a recipe for shrimp with a seasoned bread stuffing. I love to serve this dish when I have guests for dinner because I can prepare the shrimp early in the day. I've always received rave reviews over this recipe and have shared it often. You may add diced lobster or scallops to the cracker mixture just before baking. Serve with drawn butter.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix crushed crackers, bread crumbs and garlic powder. In a small bowl, blend butter and Worcestershire sauce. Mix blended butter, pepper and Parmesan cheese into the cracker mixture. Stir in white wine, using only enough to hold together the mixture.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nButterfly the shrimp using a sharp knife, and arrange back side up in a large baking dish. Stuff  shrimp with heaping tablespoons of the cracker mixture.\nBake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until cracker mixture is lightly browned, shrimp are opaque, and the tails have curled.",
