    "des": "\"Sauerbraten is a succulent German pot roast, usually beef. Making sauerbraten yourself actually just requires some time and patience, as the meat needs to sit in the marinade for 3 days. You can serve it with rice, dumplings or noodles as a side dish.\"",
    "ins": "Place brisket on a work surface and pound firmly with the textured side of a meat mallet to break down the fibers. Place brisket, onion, lemon zest, cloves and bay leaf in a bowl. Mix vinegar and water and pour over brisket. Cover and refrigerate for 3 days, turning in the marinade daily.\nRemove brisket from marinade, reserving marinade. Wrap brisket in overlapping bacon strips to cover completely; season with salt and pepper.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat; cook wrapped brisket until bacon is browned, about 5 minutes per side. Pour marinade into pan to cover half of the brisket; sprinkle carrot and parsley on top. Cover skillet and reduce heat to low. Cook brisket, turning occasionally and adding beef stock as liquid evaporates, until very tender, 2 to 3 hours. Slice brisket and arrange on a warm serving platter.",
