    "ins": "In a large bowl, whip the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until light. Gradually pour in milk, and whip until well blended.\nHeat the egg mixture in a skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. This will take 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat immediately. If it becomes solid, it has over cooked.",
