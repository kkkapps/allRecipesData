    "des": "\"Hearty and gluten-free. The whole family loves this simple dish. Add a side salad and dinner is ready quickly. I keep browned ground beef and onions cooked up and frozen, so this meal is very quick to throw together if that is already done. Top with your favorite toppings such as green peppers, olives, or mushrooms. The brown rice flour crust doesn't brown like a 'normal' crust would, so don't judge whether it is done by color!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir pizza sauce, salt, and oregano into ground beef mixture.\nSpread meat mixture into the prepared baking dish; top with mozzarella cheese.\nWhisk flour, milk, and eggs together in a bowl until well mixed; spread mixture over mozzarella cheese layer. Sprinkle 3-cheese blend over flour mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, about 35 minutes.",
