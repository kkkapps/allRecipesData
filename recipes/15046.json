    "des": "\"This is a quick but company-worthy cobbler. So simple, yet wins rave reviews.  If desired, use 2 (32 ounce) cans of peaches in place of fresh peaches. If doing this, use peach syrup instead of water and then omit the white sugar from recipe. Also, yellow cake mix can be substituted for the white.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpread peach slices evenly into a 9x13 inch baking dish. If using canned peach juice, pour 1 cup of it over peach slices. If using fresh peaches, combine water and sugar in a small bowl. Stir to dissolve, then pour mixture over peaches.\nSprinkle cinnamon over peach slices, followed by dry cake mix. Top cake mix with pats of cream cheese. Dot cobbler with butter or margarine.\nBake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, until golden.",
