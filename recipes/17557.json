Stir in the lemon juice and the garlic and heat until garlic is tender. Remove from heat.\nArrange the chops on a plate and coat top side of each chop with the butter mixture. Place chops on the grill butter side down.\nSear over high heat for 1 minute, coating the top side of the chops with the butter mixture while the other side is grilling. Flip the chops and sear the other side for 1 minute.\nTurn the meat, cover the grill and cook 3 to 5 more minutes per side, brushing occasionally with the remaining butter mixture.
