    "ins": "First make the pastry. Place the flour, butter, egg and Maille(R) Dijon Originale mustard into a processor and mix until a ball begins to form around the blade. Remove from the processor bowl and lightly shape into a ball. Wrap in cling and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil in a pan and fry cocktail sausages all over until brown. Remove from pan and cool. Wrap each sausage in a strip of ham.\nRoll out the chilled pastry on a lightly floured board. Cut into rectangles large enough to enclose a wrapped sausage. Wrap the sausages in pastry and seal with beaten egg. Make slash marks along the top of each sausage roll and then brush with the beaten egg.\nBake in a pre-heated oven at 375 degrees F for around 15 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.",
