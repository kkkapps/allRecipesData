    "des": "\"This is another recipe we experienced while vacationing in South Africa. They serve it everywhere but finding a good version of this stuff isn't always easy. In South Africa they use Peri Peri powder instead of cayenne pepper. For me this recipe is a bit of a bust if it's not spicy enough.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes.\nIncrease heat to high. Season onion with cayenne pepper and cook for just 10 seconds before adding the chicken livers; season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir chicken livers until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nRemove the pan from heat and pour brandy over the livers. Scrape the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir and serve immediately.",
