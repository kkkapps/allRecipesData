    "des": "\"These muffins are delicious.  My very, very picky son loves them for breakfast and doesn't even realize they are full of good things for him.  You can easily substitute the grains in the recipe for whatever you prefer or have on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.\nIn a small bowl, cover the raisins with water, and set aside to plump. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, dry milk powder, wheat bran, and farina cereal until thoroughly combined.\nDrain water from the raisins. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy, then mix in the drained raisins, applesauce, carrot, vegetable oil, and bran cereal. Pour the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture, and briefly mix just to moisten (do not overmix). Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full, and sprinkle each muffin with about 1/2 teaspoon of  raw sugar.\nBake in the preheated oven until the muffins are set and the tops are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin should come out clean. Serve warm.",
