    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace about 2 teaspoons of Parmesan cheese onto a silicone sheet or baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and gently spread the cheese out into a circle about 2 inches in diameter. Spread more circles of cheese onto the baking sheet, keeping them at least 1 inch apart.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning. Remove from the oven, and let cool on the sheets until warm; while still warm, drape the wafers over a small bowl or other container. Let cool. Store at room temperature in an airtight container.",
