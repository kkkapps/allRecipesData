    "des": "\"This recipe combines the elements of a spinach salad with chicken for a savory baked dish. I created it from ingredients that I needed to use before they went bad, and was very pleased with the results!\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken, honey mustard dressing, white wine, and black pepper in a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag; seal and shake to mix. Let marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.\nPlace bacon slices in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.\nHeat olive oil and butter in the same skillet over medium heat until butter is melted. Add shallots and garlic; cook until lightly browned and soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in spinach. Cook, stirring often, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nRemove chicken from marinade and place in the prepared baking dish. Discard marinade. Top each chicken breast with 1/3 of the spinach mixture, 1 slice of bacon, and 1/4 cup shredded provolone cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes.",
