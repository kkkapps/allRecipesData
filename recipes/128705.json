    "des": "\"This is a very popular dish in most Asian seafood restaurants.  The crispy breaded frog legs blend very well with the melted garlic butter sauce.  I serve mine on a platter garnished with lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, and lime wedges.  Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Place the frog legs into a bowl and sprinkle with a mixture of 2 teaspoons sugar, garlic salt, and black pepper.  Toss until evenly coated, then set aside to marinate for 30 minutes.\nHeat at least 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix the frog legs in the beaten egg to coat, then drain off excess.  Toss in cornstarch, and shake off excess.  Fry in hot oil until golden brown and cooked through; 4 to 5 minutes. Turn once to insure they cook evenly.\nWhile the frog legs are cooking, melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat; stir in 2 teaspoons of minced garlic.  Cook gently for about 3 minutes until the garlic softens, season with salt to taste.\nWhen the frog legs have finished cooking, drain well on paper towels, then place onto a serving dish.  Pour garlic-butter sauce overtop; serve with dipping sauce.\nTo make the dipping sauce, stir together the soy sauce, lime juice, chili paste, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of minced garlic in a small bowl.  Season to taste with sesame oil if desired.",
