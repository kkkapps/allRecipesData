    "des": "\"Love making this dish! It's super easy and looks fancy when it's done. I always seem to have open red wine on hand and making this is a great way to use it up! The chicken soaks up the red wine and bacon flavor and stays tender. Garnish with fresh parsley and a rosemary sprig and enjoy!\"",
