Transfer to a large bowl, and stir together with whole wheat flour, wheat bran, buckwheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, ground ginger, pumpkin pie spice, allspice, and ground nutmeg. Pour in applesauce mixture, and mix thoroughly.  Spoon mixture into prepared muffin cups, filling until level with the top of the muffin cups.\nBake in preheated oven 26 to 30 minutes, or until muffins test done with a toothpick. Remove muffins from pan, and cool on wire racks.",
