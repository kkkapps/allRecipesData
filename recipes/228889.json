    "ins": "Heat milk and butter until warm (100 degrees  to 110 degrees F); the butter will not completely melt.  Combine with undissolved yeast and brown sugar in a large mixer bowl.  Stir in salt and 2 cups flour, beat for 3 minutes.  Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nCombine boiling solution and bring to a boil.  Punch dough down and divide into 2 equal pieces.  Form each piece into a tight, smooth ball.  Boil each loaf in the solution for 2 minutes, turning after 1 minute.  Remove loaves from pot using a slotted spoon and place on a greased baking sheet.\nBrush with egg wash and cut a cross in the top. Bake for 15 minutes then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake an additional 10 to 12 minutes until the loaves are evenly browned. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.",
