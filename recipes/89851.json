    "des": "\"This is an awesome treat for the grill. We raise grass-fed lambs that are weaned naturally. Experimenting with lamb recipes over the past 15 years has become a hobby. Lamb and garlic go so well together. In this recipe, the combination of herbs and spices complement this meat and make a great family-and-friend favorite.\"",
    "ins": "Place lamb in a large bowl.\nIn a separate bowl, stir together mustard, vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, sage, and garlic. Pour over lamb, and mix to coat meat. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat outdoor grill for direct heat.\nAdd marinated lamb, fruit, and vegetables to stainless steel or bamboo skewers. Reserve some of the juice from pineapple chunks and cherries.\nIn a small bowl, stir together melted butter and splashes of juice from the pineapples and cherries to create a basting sauce.\nPlace skewers on preheated grill, and cook about 12 minutes, turning and brushing with butter sauce.",
