    "des": "\"This semi-frozen cinnamon smoothie with 'cookie dough' chews throughout is the perfect kid treat for the holidays.  They'll never guess it's 100% superfood, good for their little guts, or counteracting the sugar rushes in the treats they bring home from school. For this recipe, use strong, fresh, organic spices to drown out the banana flavor and make it a true, cinna-yum experience.\"",
    "ins": "Place bananas in a blender. Layer coconut milk, water, ice cubes, dates, cacao powder, ginger root, turmeric root, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract over bananas, in that order. Cover and pulse until shake is very smooth. Dates will remain in chunks to represent \"cookie dough chews\".",
