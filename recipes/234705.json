    "des": "\"Just threw it together one evening and it was a smokey delight. Has great flavor and is even better the next day. Has a split pea-like soup texture, and the andouille gives it a nice little kick. You can use kielbasa instead if andouille is too spicy. Or, for a little less heat, use chorizo.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken broth, lentils, sausage, cumin, chili powder, and turmeric in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the lentils are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.\nStir mushrooms into the broth mixture; continue cooking until the mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes more.",
