    "des": "\"Roasted butternut squash chunks are stirred into a creamy orange flavored risotto, made flavorful with Swanson\u00c2\u00ae Unsalted Chicken Stock, and garnished with dried cranberries and chopped pecans.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nToss butternut squash chunks lightly with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and white pepper. Spread on a roasting pan and bake in preheated oven until fork tender, 15 to 20 minutes.\nCombine Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Stock, orange juice, and rosemary in a saucepan. Bring to boil; reduce heat to low or a heat level that allows it to slowly simmer.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add onions and saute until the onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add Arborio rice and cook and stir until rice is coated and starting to toast, 1 to 2 minutes.\nPour in 1 cup of the Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Stock/orange juice mixture and stir until liquid is absorbed into the rice.\nContinue to add liquid 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until well absorbed before adding the next 1/2 cup until all the liquid has been added, about 30 minutes. Remove pan from heat; discard rosemary sprig. Stir in roasted butternut squash, butter, and dried cranberries. Season with salt and white pepper. Top with chopped pecans.",
