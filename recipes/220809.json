    "des": "\"Easy to make mini cupcakes that taste like a miniature Boston cream pie! This semi-homemade version of one of my favorite pies is a big hit at potlucks or just for a little snack to have around the house. It is also easy to make in stages and defrosts nicely when ready to serve by just letting them sit out for an hour or so on the counter.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpray 24 mini muffin cups with cooking spray.\nStir yellow cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil in a bowl until moistened. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.\nSpoon cake batter into the prepared mini muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until cupcakes have risen and are lightly golden brown, 15 to 19 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake should come out clean. Allow cupcakes to cool for about 20 minutes.\nWhisk instant French vanilla pudding mix and milk together in a bowl for 2 minutes. Allow pudding to stand for 5 more minutes to thicken.\nPipe the vanilla pudding into each cupcake with about 1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla pudding.\nFreeze filled cupcakes for at least 1 hour to make frosting them easier.\nSpread a very thin coating of chocolate frosting over each cupcake; refrigerate cupcakes for 15 minutes.\nSpread second, thicker layer of frosting over the first layer. Place small dollop of whipped cream into center of each frosted cupcake and top with a quarter of a maraschino cherry. Refrigerate mini cupcakes until serving time.",
