    "des": "\"These cabbage rolls are what my mother used to make without tomato sauce. Serve with sour cream.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, sausage, chopped onion, rice, water, and salt and pepper.\nBring a large pot of water a boil. Separate 12 to 15 large cabbage leaves from the head, and place in boiling water. Boil until soft, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from water, and set aside.\nInto the center of each leaf, place a small amount of the meat mixture. Fold in the sides, and roll up from the bottom. Secure with a toothpick.\nPlace a layer of  sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot. Arrange cabbage rolls in a single layer over the sauerkraut. Cover with remaining sauerkraut.  Pour in enough water to cover the rolls.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 90 minutes.",
