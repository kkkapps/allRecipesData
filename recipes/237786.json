    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add mostaccioli and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the inside of a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nHeat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.\nMix pasta sauce, Italian seasoning, cumin, salt, black pepper, and garlic salt into ground beef mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 20 minutes.\nStir sour cream, cream cheese, and ricotta cheese together in a bowl until smooth. Stir cheese mixture and pasta together in a bowl until evenly coated; spread into the prepared baking dish. Spoon pasta sauce mixture over pasta mixture. Cover dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove foil and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over pasta sauce. Bake until cheese is bubbling, about 20 minutes more.",
