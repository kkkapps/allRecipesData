    "des": "\"This is delicious spread on crackers or a sliced baguette with a smear of blue cheese. It can also be used as a topping for a wheel of warm brie. It's important to use a good quality aged balsamic vinegar in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; stir onion in the hot oil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened and caramel-colored, 20 to 25 minutes.\nStir figs into onion; cook and stir until figs begin to lose their shape and have softened into onion, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour balsamic vinegar into fig-onion mixture; cook until all the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, into fig-onion mixture until desired sweetness is reached. Serve warm or chilled.",
