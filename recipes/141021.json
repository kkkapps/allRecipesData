    "des": "\"These tangy shrimp are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  They can be individually plated for the appetizer of a sit down dinner, or kept warm in a chafing dish at a buffet or cocktail party.  Simply insert a frilled toothpick in each shrimp and smother with the sauce!\"",

In a small bowl, whisk together flour and water, then whisk into the steak sauce mixture.  Cook and stir constantly until thickened and smooth.  Adjust the thickness of the sauce, if necessary, adding a little more steak sauce if too thin or more sherry if too thick.  Keep warm while cooking shrimp.\nPlace 2 tablespoons butter and canola oil in a large skillet over high heat. Once the butter has melted, stir in shrimp, and cook until pink and opaque, about 5 minutes.  Place shrimp on a heated serving plate and dress with sauce.  Serve hot.",
