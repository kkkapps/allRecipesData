    "des": "\"Great as an appetizer or a meal.  I love broccoli rabe, so I usually do this as an entire meal. To add some variation to this meal, try cooking Italian sausage in a separate skillet then adding it to the mix when you add the chickpeas.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli rabe, and cook uncovered until the stems are tender, about 5 minutes. Drain in a colander.\nMeanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in half of the garlic slices, and cook until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic. Stir in the remaining garlic, then add the drained broccoli rabe. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the garbanzo beans, and continue to cook and stir until the beans are hot. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving.",
