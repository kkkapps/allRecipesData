    "des": "\"Fried chicken tenders with a crisp buffalo wing pretzel coating are served with a creamy blue cheese sauce and buffalo wing sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Using a rolling pin, crush Pretzel Crisps(R) until fine, but with some texture. Transfer to a clean plate. In a bowl, beat together the egg and one cup of the buffalo wing sauce, and set aside. Dip each chicken tender first in the egg mixture and roll to coat in the crushed pretzels.\nIn a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat until shimmering. Add chicken tenders and cook, turning often, until golden brown on all sides (about six minutes total). Transfer to paper towels to drain. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, blue cheese, and Worcestershire sauce. Serve blue cheese sauce with chicken and remaining 1/2 cup or reserved wing sauce.",
