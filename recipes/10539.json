    "ins": "In a large bowl, beat butter with 1/2 cup sugar and almond extract until light and fluffy.  With wooden spoon, stir in flour until smooth and well combined. Divide dough into 2 parts.  Refrigerate, covered for 2 hours.\nPreheat oven 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nOn lightly sugared surface, roll out dough, one part at a time, about 1/2 inch thick. Using a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out cookies.  Place 1 inch apart, on ungreased cookie sheet.  With end of wooden spoon, or cookie press, make an indentation in center of each cookie.\nBake 25 to 30 minutes, or until light golden brown around the edges.  While still warm, roll in sugar. Cool completely on a wire rack.",
