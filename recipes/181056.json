Charring the jalapeno peppers (optional) gives it that smokiness, and the jalapeno pepper seeds need to be in the hot sauce (picante) for the heat. \"",
    "ins": "Remove the stems from the jalapeno peppers, and the seeds from one jalapeno. Place both jalapeno peppers, tomatoes with liquid, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, and salt in a blender; pulse to desired consistency. Serve",
