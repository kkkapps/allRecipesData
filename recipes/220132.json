    "ins": "Place raisins, whiskey, and brown sugar into a resealable plastic bag.\nPlace steaks into the bag, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 10 to 30 minutes.\nHeat canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.\nTransfer steaks and marinade to the hot skillet.\nRemove raisins from the skillet with a slotted spoon once they have plumped, about 5 minutes; set aside.\nCook steaks until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).\nServe the steaks with the raisins.",
