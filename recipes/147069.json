    "des": "\"Several years ago I was looking for a recipe to take advantage of our bumper crop of plums, and came across a recipe similar to this.  After tweaking a bit, I have come up with a very versatile version that my family and friends love. Season with ground white pepper and use it as a side dish for pork or chicken. Sprinkle with toasted almonds and spoon it over vanilla bean ice cream, angel food, or pound cake for dessert! Play around with the spice combination by adding cloves, allspice, or cayenne.  Be adventurous!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish with cooking spray.\nPlace the plums, cut-side up, in a single layer in the baking dish.\nWhisk together the orange juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, and cardamom in a bowl; drizzle over the plums.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until plums are hot and the sauce is bubbly. Top with toasted almonds, if desired (see Cook's Note).",
