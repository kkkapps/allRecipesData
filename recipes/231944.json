    "des": "\"My husbands favorite. Simple and delicious. A white macaroni and cheese with meat. I have also made with cooked drained Italian sausage. Leftovers are really good. The degreasing is an added step, but it really helps. I made it with out doing that the first time, it was so greasy I couldn't eat it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the inside of a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBring a large pot water to a boil; add salt. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Drain.\nLine a microwave-safe plate with paper towels; arrange pepperoni atop paper towels. Top with another paper towel.\nMicrowave pepperoni for 1 minute. Carefully remove top paper towel to release steam; replace with new paper towels (top and bottom) and continue microwaving, in 1-minute intervals, until most of the grease has been released. Repeat with salami.\nWhisk eggs and milk together in a large bowl; mix in elbow macaroni, pepperoni, salami, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish; pat down with a spoon. Cover dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until bubbling and lightly browned, about 10 more minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.",
