    "des": "\"This rich Mediterranean butter cookie is named after the Arabic word for 'swoon', ghraybeh.  The key ingredient for these exotic treats is the semolina.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nSift together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, and semolina and set aside. Beat the butter for at least 10 minutes until it is fluffy.  Then beat 2 more minutes while sprinkling in the blossom water and confectioners' sugar. Fold in the flour mixture gradually. Then refrigerate the soft dough in covered bowl for about 10 minutes.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll or pat the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness, and cut into 1 inch sided diamonds and place them 1/2 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Then place an almond in the center of each cookie.\nBack 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven.  Do not over bake.  Let the cookies cool for at least an hour.  The are best served after they have cooled for several hours.",
