    "des": "\"By replacing half the butter with applesauce and half the chocolate chips with raisins, I only slightly altered the original. They are still soft and tasty with half the fat.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together flour and baking soda.\nBeat butter, applesauce, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in instant pudding until well blended. Stir in eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract.  Blend flour mixture into butter mixture until just incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips, raisins, and walnuts; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until edges of cookies are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on wire racks.",
