Spread mixture in prepared baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the side of the dish comes out almost clean, about 25 minutes.\nTransfer baking dish from oven to wire cooking rack and while still hot, arrange mint candies across the top about 1/4- to 1/2-inch apart. Let sit until candies melt, about 3 minutes. Spread melted mints evenly over brownies with a spatula. Cool until top layer hardens, 4 to 5 hours.",
