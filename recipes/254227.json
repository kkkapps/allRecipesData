    "des": "\"Oven roasting the squash blossoms, instead of frying, makes this a nice light summer dish. Pick your squash blossoms early in the day, and store in the fridge until ready to use. Top with some fresh basil pesto for added yum!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium heat; add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in chard and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Add basil, salt, and pepper, and cook until basil is soft, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool completely, about 15 minutes. Place cooled chard mixture between 2 towels and press to remove excess moisture.\nStir chevre and chard mixture together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Fill zucchini blossoms about 3/4 full with the goat chevre mixture, and pinch the ends closed. Place filled blossoms in a roasting pan; drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nRoast in the preheated oven until blossoms are hot, about 10 minutes.",
