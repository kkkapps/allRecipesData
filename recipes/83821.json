    "des": "\"These savory almonds are easy to make and take almost no time at all. They are delicious while still warm, but taste just as good cold. Goes well with Kalamata olives and feta cheese as a small appetizer tray. If you are using raw almonds, increase the baking time.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a bowl, mix together almonds, olive oil, garlic, and rosemary until nuts are completely coated. Season with salt. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.\nBake in a preheated oven for 10 minutes.",
