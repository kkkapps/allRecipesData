    "des": "\"Delicious bits of broccoli are drenched in a cheese mixture and fried. When our local restaurant stopped serving their Broccoli Bites, we were devastated. So I tried to duplicate them at home one night. It was funny to note that soon after, they started carrying them again here.\"",
    "ins": "To make the sauce: In a small bowl, stir together the mustard and honey. Set aside.\nChop florets into small pieces or pulse lightly in food processor. Toss in a mixing bowl with shredded cheese. Set aside.\nBeat egg and stir in the milk. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together and combine them with the egg and milk mixture, beating well. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon oil as well. Pour mixture over broccoli and cheese and toss to coat well.\nIn a large skillet or saucepan heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nDrop broccoli mixture by spoonfuls into 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oil and fry until golden brown. Serve with honey mustard sauce.",
