    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLayer the chicken breast halves into the bottom of a baking dish. Stir the cream of mushroom soup, mushrooms, garlic, curry powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until mixed. Add the white wine to the soup mixture and stir until smooth; pour over the chicken breast halves. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese and paprika over the mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
