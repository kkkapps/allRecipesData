    "des": "\"This is a very popular dish in France. Artichokes are steamed or boiled in salted water and simply served with a homemade vinaigrette. Prepared this way, you get to really enjoy their flavor. A delicious dish and so easy to prepare. When you get to the heart of the artichoke, remove the hair and fill the cavity with vinaigrette... it's like finding treasure after a long quest.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Simmer artichokes in the boiling water until softened, about 30 minutes. Drain.\nMix vinegar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Whisk in olive oil in a slow, steady stream until vinaigrette is blended.\nStart by eating the artichoke leaves dipped in the vinaigrette. Discard small leaves and gently scrape fuzzy choke from the hearts. Fill the hearts with vinaigrette and slice.",
