Place squash, cut-side down, on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Cool squash for 10 minutes; scrape flesh out of squash with a fork.\nCook and stir sausages in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nStir spaghetti squash, canned tomatoes, diced tomato, and garlic into skillet with sausages; cook and stir until warmed-through, 2 to 4 minutes. Add spinach; cook and stir until spinach wilts, 2 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.",
