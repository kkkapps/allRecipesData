    "ins": "Dissolve yeast in warm water.\nIn a large bowl combine milk, sugar, and salt. Use a mixer to beat in molasses, butter, yeast mixture, and 1 cup of rye flour.\nUse a wooden spoon to mix in the remaining rye flour. Add white flour by stirring until the dough is stiff enough to knead.\nKnead 5 to 10 minutes, adding flour as needed. If the dough sticks to your hands or the board add more flour.\nCover dough and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until double.\nPunch down dough and divide to form two round loaves. Let loaves rise on a greased baking sheet until double, about 1 1/2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes.",
