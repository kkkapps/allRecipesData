    "des": "\"When my husband and I were visiting Toledo, Spain, we enjoyed a refreshing, tangy, and creamy bowl of gazpacho outside a small church at a tiny storefront restaurant. I had never tasted anything like it. I asked how they made it and developed this recipe to take home. If you like, serve chopped cucumbers, peppers, and parsley as a garnish.\"",
    "ins": "Blend the green bell pepper, cucumber, garlic, and 1/2 cup olive oil together in a blender until smooth. Add the bread slices to the blender one at a time and blend each into the mixture until smooth. Blend the tomatoes into the mixture one at a time until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl; season with salt and cayenne pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon olive oil to serve.",
