    "ins": "Prepare the rice in a large pot according to package directions.\nCut the kielbasa into 1-inch chunks and quarter the chunks. Place in a large skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Season with cayenne pepper to taste. Transfer this to the pot with the rice, reserving the grease in the skillet.\nIn the same skillet over medium-high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice, and onion; reduce heat to medium and saute for 5 more minutes. Drain well and add to the pot. Stir the kidney beans, pinto beans, and pork and beans into the pot. Add a little water, if necessary, and simmer over low heat until ready to serve.",
