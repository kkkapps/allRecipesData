    "ins": "Place the bacon, onion, and garlic in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat until the onions caramelize, 10 to 12 minutes.\nPour the chicken stock into the pan; add the Brussels sprouts. Bring the liquid to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir the mixture so the sprouts are coated in the liquid\nPlace a cover on the skillet and cook until the sprouts are cooked through yet firm, about 15 minutes.",
