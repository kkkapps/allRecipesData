    "des": "\"Gorgonzola cheese in a garlicky butter sauce that is easy yet impressive. Tastes just like that yummy sauce that restaurants serve over gilled chicken and steak.\"",
    "ins": "In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the butter, Gorgonzola cheese, green onion, garlic and pepper. Warm slowly for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally until the sauce is nice and creamy. This sauce may also be cooked on a cool part of your grill while grilling meat.",
