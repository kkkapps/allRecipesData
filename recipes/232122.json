    "des": "\"I like starting my day with a smoothie and only had cranberry juice one morning. I personally dislike the taste of cranberry juice, but need the health benefits. Cranberry juice reportedly helps prevent UTIs and the formation of kidney stones, and is also full of phytochemicals, which are possible cancer deterrents. It turned delicious. I can finally get my cranberry juice fix and enjoy it at the same time.\"",
