    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nFill the jalapeno peppers with cream cheese. Sprinkle the Cajun seasoning on top, then wrap each stuffed jalapeno with a slice of bacon. Secure with a toothpick. Arrange the wrapped jalapeno peppers in a single layer, face down on a broiler rack.\nBroil in the preheated oven until the bacon becomes crisp, 8 to 15 minutes on each side.",
