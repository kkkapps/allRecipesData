    "des": "\"These are fabulous pork chops. Pork is very lean, and this quick broiling method keeps the meat juicy and succulent. Serve with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes for a complete meal.\"",

Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside half of the sauce.\nPreheat broiler.\nBrush both sides of the chops with sauce. Place chops on broiling pan rack. Broil about 4 inches from the heat for 4 minutes on each side. Brush with more sauce.  Continue broiling, turning and basting every 3 to 4 minutes, until juices run clear.
