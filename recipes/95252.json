    "des": "\"This is the best, easiest slow cooker cream corn. It's very rich, not diet food, but is always such a big hit I have to tell everyone how to make it! You may want to half this recipe for a smaller family, but this is excellent leftover a day or even two.\"",
    "ins": "In a 6 quart slow cooker, combine the corn, cream cheese, butter, sugar, American cheese and milk. Cover and set to Low. Cook for about 3 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. Cheese and milk burn easily, so I would not recommend cutting the time and using the High setting.",
