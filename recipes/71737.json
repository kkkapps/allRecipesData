    "des": "\"This is a wonderful way to add elegance and flavor to spinach. The warm goat cheese melts in your mouth and nicely accents the balsamic vinegar.\"",
    "ins": "Arrange the spinach on four plates.\nIn a skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and add crushed garlic. Cook and stir until slightly golden. Stir in breadcrumbs. Drop the goat cheese slices into the breadcrumbs a few at a time, and turn to coat in the breadcrumb mixture.\nPlace a slice or two of goat cheese on each serving of spinach, and drizzle the salads with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.",
