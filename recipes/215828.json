    "des": "\"I've been trying for over a year to recreate a lobster bisque my son loved at a restaurant we went to in Maine, and I believe this is it!  Creamy texture with kind of a tanginess and a bit of a bite and lots of tender lobster bits.  And the nice thing about this recipe is that is actually quite nutrition-friendly.  High protein, but low fat using lower fat options for the ingredients (1 or 2% milk, fat free broth) and still tastes like you should feel guilty. Don't let the number of ingredients deter you, it's actually very easy to throw together.  Note about the cayenne pepper, a small increase or decrease makes a big difference in the amount of bite!  Start with the 1/4 teaspoon and go up to taste.  Serve with a salad and/or a crusty Italian or French bread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the white wine and sherry. Cook and stir until the liquid has reduced by half. Sprinkle in the flour while stirring to ensure there are no lumps. Once a thick paste has formed, stir in the tomato paste, then pour in the chicken broth and milk. Season with cayenne pepper, black pepper, seafood seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and green onion.\nCook and stir over medium heat until the bisque begins to simmer, about 15 minutes. Stir in the lobster meat, and reheat before serving.",
