    "des": "\"Great way to use up the ever-plentiful summertime squash. Very flexible recipe. Definitely a very yummy family favorite. Love to serve it over rice or millet. It can be easily adjusted to suit your tastes. I have used shredded cooked chicken in place of the beef. I have also added other garden veggies that I needed to use up.\"",
    "ins": "Cook and stir the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until brown and crumbly, breaking the meat apart as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Drain off excess grease. Set the beef aside.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with about 1 teaspoon of olive oil.\nPour the remaining olive oil into a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the zucchini, red bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and the white parts of the green onions until the vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper, and mix in the tomato paste, chili powder, and cumin. Allow the mixture to simmer until the spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.\nStir in the browned ground beef, black beans, kidney beans, corn, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese until well combined. Adjust salt and pepper if necessary, and spread the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and cover the dish with foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling in the center, 20 to 25 minutes; remove the foil, return to oven, and bake until the cheese is browned, 5 to 10 more minutes. Sprinkle the remaining green onions (green tops) and cilantro over the top.",
