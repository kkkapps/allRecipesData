    "des": "\"This looks complicated, but it is so simple.  I came up with this recipe when I needed to use up a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes and basil from my patio garden. It is rich and creamy and a perfect fettuccine for a warm summer night. I served this with a crisp white wine......perfecto!\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccini, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nPlace the pancetta in a large, deep skillet, and cook and stir over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain the pancetta on a paper towel-lined plate.\nHeat 1/2 of the heavy cream in the skillet over medium heat. Stir in the fettuccine, and bring to a boil. Add the remaining heavy cream, garlic, pancetta, tomatoes, and basil. Cook and stir until the sauce is reduced, about 15 minutes. Season with pepper. Top with Parmesan cheese before serving.",
