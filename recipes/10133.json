    "des": "\"My mother used to make these cookies, they are my all time favorite.  She usually frosted them with a white icing.  I made them for my children but they usually didn't last long enough to get frosted.  Now I make them for my 14 month old granddaughter.  They are so soft and so good!  I usually double the recipe.\"",
