    "des": "\"I'm a Vietnamese living in Indiana who had to find a recipe for one of my favorite Vietnamese snacks, banh bao. They are a variation on the Chinese cha siu bao (Chinese pork buns). I would like to thank Houston Wok for providing Ms. SkimmyJeans' moist filling recipe and Miss Adventure[at]home for a tasty bun recipe. Combined, this is my ultimate banh bao recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Mix pork, shallots, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce together in a large bowl. Let mixture marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes.\nCombine self-rising flour, milk, and sugar in another large bowl; knead until dough is smooth and no longer sticky. Cover dough with cheesecloth; let rest, about 5 minutes.\nDivide dough into 18 balls. Roll out each ball into a circle with a rolling pin on a floured work surface. Place a spoonful of the pork mixture in the center; top with 2 sausage slices and an egg quarter. Gather the edges of each circle together like a coin purse; twist and pinch to seal the bun.\nCut waxed paper into eighteen 2-inch squares. Place each bun on a waxed paper square. Arrange 1 inch apart in a steamer; cover with lid.\nSteam buns until puffed up, about 30 minutes.",
