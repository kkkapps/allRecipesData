    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSpread roma tomatoes, zucchini, green bell pepper, and onion onto a large baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss vegetables to coat evenly with oil; season with salt and black pepper.\nBake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender and starting to brown, about 30 minutes. Let vegetables cool.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside to cool.\nPeel and discard skins from roma tomatoes. Combine the roasted vegetables, rotini, and pesto in a large bowl. Serve slightly warm or chill if desired.",
