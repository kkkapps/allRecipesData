    "des": "\"Just a handful of ingredients go into this quick pasta toss; it's a great way to take advantage of a bumper crop of zucchini. You can add many different veggies to make this your way. You could dice onions and saute it in the olive oil until translucent before adding the garlic. Diced tomatoes and fresh mushrooms would be delicious as well. You can use farfalle or penne in place of linguine, if desired.\"",
