    "des": "\"These tasty meatballs will disappear quickly from anyone's holiday party. My mom makes them every year for New Years Eve, and now so do I. These do very well in a slow cooker, as you can simmer them before serving, as well as keep them hot for the duration of your party.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, water, bread crumbs, and minced onion. Roll into small meatballs.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, turning once.\nIn a slow cooker or large saucepan over low heat, blend the cranberry sauce, chili sauce, brown sugar, and lemon juice. Add meatballs, and simmer for 1 hour before serving.",
