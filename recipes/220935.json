    "des": "\"This is a traditional Italian cake made during Carnivale AND Easter. Some call it a 'Spongy Orange Cake' but we think the texture is between that and a regular cake. It is by far my husband's favorite cake of all time. I've topped it with Avon's Warm Orange Sauce which takes this dump-and-mix cake from GREAT to SPECTACULAR!\"",
