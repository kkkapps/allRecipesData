    "des": "\"Serve this spicy tomato fish stew with chopped fresh parsley, plenty of white crusty bread to mop of the juices, and a green vegetable such as beans or broccoli.\"",
    "ins": "Heat half of the olive oil in a wide shallow casserole and cook the onion and the tomatoes until softened and reduced to a thick paste, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato puree and the cayenne.\nCut the potatoes lengthwise into 4-6 wedges and arrange on top of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle with salt and set fish fillets on top. Pour in the cold water, making sure the potatoes are just covered. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer.\nCover and simmer for 20 minutes until the potatoes are tender--the fish will be cooked in that time.\nIf you want, remove the lid and bubble the mixture rapidly to reduce it. However, it's best to leave plenty of juice when making this dish to mash the potatoes in.",
