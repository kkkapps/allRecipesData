    "des": "\"This recipe was a frequent favorite when I was in college, because it is made with ingredients most students have in their kitchens.  I have made this with low fat ingredients, and it works very well.  Since I have gotten older, I have added chicken and shrimp to the recipe; it is very adaptable.  Easy, tastes wonderful, but not very easy on the waistline.\"",
