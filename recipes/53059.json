    "des": "\"I made up this recipe for a cool summer dish to take to a picnic. I just threw together things I had on hand and it became a hit! You may substitute your favorite type of bean for the garbanzos. Any firm bean will do. You may omit the jalapeno altogether. This salad will work as a main course and is very satisfying and colorful. The different tastes and textures are very pleasing. Serve cold.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix the garbanzo beans, red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, jalapeno pepper, red onion, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, lemon juice, and olive oil. Drizzle over the salad, and toss to coat. Refrigerate salad at least 4 hours before serving.",
