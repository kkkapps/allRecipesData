    "des": "\"I made this up after I could only find baked sweet potato chips on Allrecipes. (Those are great, too, but I was already frying fish and wanted some nice crunchy chips.) These are crisp, delicious, and easy. Don't sweat the measurements. I just eyeballed it, and you can too. Mix the seasoning to your own taste.\"",

Remove a few sweet potato slices at a time, allowing excess milk to drip offl; dip the slices into the flour mixture. Place the coated sweet potatoes on a plate. Repeat with remaining sweet potatoes.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\nCombine 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.\nFry the coated sweet potatoes, working in 2 to 3 batches, until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.
