The flavor and texture of the pomegranate gives it a fine touch and makes it the favorite of everybody, including the most sophisticated palates. It is not only delicious, but colorful and, definitely, Mexican. Try it! After the pomegranate, you will never go back to tomatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the onion with the juice of 2 limes in a small bowl; allow the onion to soak in the lime juice for 2 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the lime juice. Set the onions aside.\nGrind the serrano chile peppers, the juice of 2 limes, and salt together in a food processor until smooth; add the avocado and continue processing until creamy and smooth. Transfer the mixture into a small serving bowl; fold the soaked onions, chopped cilantro, and about half the pomegranate seeds into the avocado mixture. Top with the remaining pomegranate seeds and garnish with the cilantro sprig to serve.",
