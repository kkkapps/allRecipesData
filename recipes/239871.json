    "des": "\"My dad came up with this recipe years ago. Over the years, everyone I have shared this with always reacts the same way. First, they tell me 'that sounds awful!' After they eat it their story changes to 'that was amazing!' \n\nI know the idea of mayo and mustard on a scrambled egg disk sounds odd, but trust me; you'll love it.\n\n I know the cooking method for the eggs may be sacrilege for some folks; I just ask that you try it before changing it up.\"",
    "ins": "Beat eggs, milk, and salt together in a bowl.\nHeat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook eggs in hot skillet without stirring until set on the bottom, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip eggs and cook without stirring until set on the other side, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat.\nSpread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise on each piece of toast. Spread mustard over mayonnaise onto each piece of toast. Place eggs on one piece of toast and top with remaining toast.",
