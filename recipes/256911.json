    "des": "\"Whether you're tailgating, watching the big game at home or just planning a family movie night, this Texas Chili Dog is guaranteed to please. Delicious Ball Park Brand\u00c2\u00ae Franks are even better when topped with hearty Texas chili, freshly grated cheese and chopped sweet onion. You can always add a few slices of jalapeno, if you like it hot. Tater Tots or Fritos make the best sides.\"",
    "ins": "To make chili, brown ground beef in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large saucepan for about 10 minutes over medium heat.\nAdd onion and red bell pepper, stirring well. Add tomato sauce and seasonings, stirring well.\nAllow mixture to bubble for about 10 minutes, then reduce heat to simmer and cook at least 30 minutes.\nTo make hot dogs, cook on your grill or on a grill pan until just seared on the outside.\nMeanwhile, toast buns in a 400-degree oven for about 10 minutes, taking care not to brown.\nSwipe each bun with mustard, top with chili as desired, followed by grated cheese, onion and, if you're brave, jalapenos.\nIf you'd like the cheese all melty, place chili dogs on a foil-lined cookie sheet and run under a hot broiler for 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese bubbles.",
