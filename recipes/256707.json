    "ins": "For each pot of gold you will need a whole Pretzel Crisps(R), another Pretzel Crisps(R) with the round sides broken off, and a piece of licorice string.\nDip each in chocolate. Place broken Pretzel Crisps(R) first, then layer whole on top allowing broken piece to peek out. Next put dipped licorice string at top of whole Pretzel Crisps(R). Allow chocolate to harden.\nUse chocolate to adhere rainbow belts to the back of the Pretzel Crisps(R) pots. Spread a little chocolate above the licorice string and sprinkle on some of the yellow confetti sprinkles as gold coins.\nChill in the fridge to help \"glue\" the rainbow belts and coins to the pot o' gold!",
