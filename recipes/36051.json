    "des": "\"These are yummy pork and vegetable filled won ton cups, made in a mini-muffin pan.  Use premade won ton wraps (round if you can find them).\"",
    "ins": "In a food processor, finely chop the celery, carrots, garlic, onion, and water chestnuts. The pieces should be small and fairly uniform, but not liquid.\nIn a large skillet, combine the ground pork and chopped vegetables. Cook over medium heat until the vegetables are soft, and the pork is no longer pink. Increase the heat to high, and let the moisture evaporate, then stir in peanut sauce and cook for 5 more minutes before removing from heat.\nWhile the pork mixture is cooking, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press one wonton wrap into each cup of a mini muffin pan, with the edges flared out to the sides. Place one scoop of the meat mixture into each cup.\nBake for about 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the outer wrappers are crisp and golden. Allow to cool slightly in the pan before removing to a serving tray.",
