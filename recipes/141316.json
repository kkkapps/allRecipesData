    "des": "\"Whenever we go out for Chinese food, my friends always order this vegetable dish from the 'secret' menu. It is so yummy and different and probably pretty good for you because it is as green as spinach. I've been scouring the vegetable aisle for months trying to figure out what exactly the stuff is. Lo and behold, today I found it at Superstore. Of course I didn't know exactly until I actually cooked it, but there was no mistaking it. They are snow pea shoots! Yumm yumm!\"",
    "ins": "Toss the strips of chicken breast with the cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with the sesame oil and toss until evenly mixed.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in the chicken and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Stir in the pea shoots just until wilted; pour in the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Cook and stir a  few minutes until the chicken broth has thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
