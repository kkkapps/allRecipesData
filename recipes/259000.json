    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe when I had a sweet tooth that needed tending to, and I wanted to make it a little healthier than your average cookie. So I replaced some of the flour with coconut and almond flour and used 1/2 cup of coconut oil instead of a whole cup of butter. I use all organic ingredients, but that's up to you. This is our family go-to cookie recipe. We've made it so many different ways and loved them all, but our favorites are semisweet chocolate chips with walnuts, or white chocolate chips with macadamia nuts. It's a win-win with these amazing cookies.\"",

Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until just combined.\nCombine all-purpose flour, almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Whisk to mix evenly. Pour into the butter mixture; stir until well combined. Fold in chocolate chips and nuts.
