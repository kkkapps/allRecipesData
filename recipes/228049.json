    "ins": "Combine vinegar, miso paste, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and garlic in a small bowl. Stir until smooth.\nSpread miso mixture generously on both sides of skirt steaks. Sprinkle with black pepper. Allow to rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.\nPrepare a charcoal grill for medium-high heat. Place steak on the grill and cook without moving for about 2 minutes. Turn steaks 180 degrees to create cross-hatch grill marks, and cook another 2 minutes. Flip steaks and continue cooking until medium-rare to medium on the inside, and shiny on the outside, about 4 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Allow to rest for 5 minutes.",
