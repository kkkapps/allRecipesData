    "des": "\"A baked zucchini fry with crushed almonds replacing bread crumbs makes a very light, tasty dish. Zucchini are prepped first to get rid of extra liquid so they do not become soggy in the oven. Like having fried food without the oil.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nCut zucchini into 3-inch lengths, then cut each piece into 9 fries. Place zucchini fries into a colander and sprinkle with salt. Let the zucchini pieces drain for at least 1 hour to remove excess liquid.\nBeat eggs in a shallow bowl. Mix almonds, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning in a second shallow bowl. Rinse salt off zucchini and pat dry with paper towels.\nDip each zucchini piece into beaten egg and roll in the almond coating. Place coated fries on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until the zucchini are tender and the coating is crisp and browned, about 25 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking time.",
