    "des": "\"Neck bones are great with greens or cabbage. They can be baked or boiled, this recipe can be fixed either way. It depends upon how much attention you want to give the dish. I think this is one of this meals that takes you back to your mother's kitchen.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSprinkle 3/4 of the onion and garlic into the bottom of a roasting pan; pour in the vinegar and water. Season the neck bones with salt and pepper and place into the roasting pan. Sprinkle the remaining onion and garlic over the neck bones; cover the roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 2 hours, basting every 30 minutes. Be sure to recover the foil every time you baste. After 2 hours, remove the foil and continue baking until the neck bones are golden brown, about 45 minutes.",
