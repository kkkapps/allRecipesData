    "des": "\"This has been a hit at many dinner parties. Figs are stuffed with a creamy, rich mascarpone cheese and cognac mixture, then rolled in toasted hazelnuts. Garnish with whole hazelnuts and mint leaves when serving. If an injector is unavailable, marinate the figs in 1/2 cup cognac for approximately 30 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "Using a marinade injector baster, inject figs with about 1 tablespoon cognac, dividing the amount equally amongst the figs. Chill in the refrigerator while preparing remaining ingredients.\nIn a medium bowl, blend remaining cognac, mascarpone cheese and 3/4 of the confectioners' sugar. Chill in the refrigerator while preparing remaining ingredients.\nIn a blender or food processor, mix toasted hazelnuts, mint leaves and remaining confectioner' sugar. Place the mixture in a medium bowl.\nRemove stems from figs, and cut in half lengthwise. Fill halves with equal portions of the cognac and mascarpone cheese mixture. Roll in the hazelnut mixture. Arrange on a medium serving platter, cheese side up, and chill in the refrigerator until serving.",
