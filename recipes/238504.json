    "des": "\"The Bellini was created in the late 1930s to early 1940s by Guiseppe Cipriani at the legendary Harry's Bar in Venice, a favorite hangout for expats including Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis, and Orson Welles. The fruity cocktail owes its name and color to Cipriani's fascination with Giovanni Bellini, a 15th-century Venetian artist. Originally prepared with Prosecco and white peach puree, it's perfectly acceptable to use yellow peach puree or prepared peach nectar and/or peach schnapps. Sip and feel sophisticated!\"",
    "ins": "Pour peach juice into a champagne flute. Slowly pour sparkling wine over peach juice; let sit until liquids have blended, about 1 minute. Pour raspberry juice over champagne mixture.",
