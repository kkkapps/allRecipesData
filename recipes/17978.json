    "des": "\"Very easy sour cream pie that tastes very much like cheesecake. Use your favorite type of fruit pie filling on top, and garnish with whipped topping if you like. You can even use low-fat ingredients to lighten it up.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, mix together sour cream, sugar, salt, and flour. Add eggs and vanilla; stir until thoroughly combined. Pour mixture into graham cracker crust.\nBake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until firm. Spoon pie filling over top immediately. Allow to cool slightly, then refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.",
