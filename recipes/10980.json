    "des": "\"This recipe is very simple but sometimes the mixture might not be stiff enough or stick to the board.  So you have to sprinkle flour to the mixture until it is stiff enough and will not stick on your fingers.\"",
    "ins": "Cream the butter.  Beat in the sugar, egg and milk. Sift flour and baking powder together.  Combine with butter mixture.\nReserve 2 dozen whole nuts and chop the rest info fine pieces.  Add the chopped nuts to the mixture.\nUsing a teaspoon, drop the mixture onto a buttered baking sheet.  Put a whole nut on top of each cookie.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until done.",
