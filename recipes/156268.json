    "ins": "Combine the soy sauce and ginger in a small bowl.  Add tofu slices; cover and refrigerate overnight.\nBring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Keep hot.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove tofu from marinade, place on a baking sheet. Reserve marinade.\nToast the sesame seeds by placing them in a dry skillet over medium heat. Stir seeds constantly until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Immediately remove toasted seeds from pan to prevent burning. Reserve.\nBake the tofu in the preheated oven until hot and cooked to your liking, approximately 8 minutes.  Drizzle tofu with remaining marinade.\nDivide rice between 2 bowls, top with baked tofu, drizzle with honey, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.",
