    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, white sugar, and brown sugar. Cut in the shortening by pinching between your fingers or using a pastry blender, until the mixture has lumps no larger than peas. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, water, vanilla, and almond extract.\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry, and mix until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into halves, pat into a ball, and flatten slightly. Wrap each one in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight before rolling out to make a crust.",
