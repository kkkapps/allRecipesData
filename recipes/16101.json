    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets.\nSift together the flour, baking powder and salt, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the eggs, milk and vanilla, stirring after each addition. Add the dry ingredients and mix until a stiff dough forms. Separate 1/4 of the dough form the rest and set aside in a small bowl. Add the nuts to the dough in the small bowl. Add the pudding mix and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips to the large portion of dough; mix until blended.\nRoll the pudding flavored dough into walnut sized balls, and place them 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten the balls using your hand or the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. Roll the dough from the small bowl into marble sized balls, place 1 ball on top of each of the flattened cookies. Then, on top of each cookie, place 1 of the white chocolate chips.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cookies are set. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks. When cool, dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.",
