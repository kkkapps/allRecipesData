    "des": "\"The original recipe is delicious, but this is my healthier version, with less fat and calories. It also freezes beautifully and individual portions can be reheated in 3 minutes in the microwave. As a single person, I can't eat 8 portions at one sitting, so I divide and freeze. But it's great if family visits, because I can have the portions ready to reheat, and it's also great if you're in a hurry in the morning and don't have time to cook before heading off to work.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nArrange hash brown patties in a single layer in the prepared baking dish; top with Canadian bacon. Sprinkle Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese over Canadian bacon.\nWhisk egg substitute, milk, salt, and mustard together in a bowl; pour over cheese layer. Cover dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove aluminum foil and bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean and edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
