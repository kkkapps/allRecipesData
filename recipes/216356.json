    "des": "\"This is my father's recipe for potatoes that were served aboard the battleship USS New York during WWII. This recipe is simple, but very tasty.\"",
    "ins": "Place the potato wedges in a bowl of water, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Melt 1/2 cup of butter in a small saucepan over low heat; pour it into a shallow dish. Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a second shallow dish. Roll potato wedges in the seasoned flour, then dip into the butter. Arrange potato wedges on the baking sheet. Melt and add more butter for dipping as you go along (the flour makes it thick).\nBake the wedges in the preheated oven until tender and golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.",
