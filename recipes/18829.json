    "des": "\"This casserole is wonderful for a backyard picnic. It uses all fresh ingredients and simply contains corn, tomatoes and bacon. A great complement for a barbecue.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until crisp and evenly brown; drain. Chop bacon, and set aside.\nCut corn from cobs. There should be about 4 or 5 cups of corn kernels. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the bacon and salt, and remove from heat.\nSpread a layer of the corn mixture into the bottom of a 2-quart casserole dish, then layer with tomatoes. Repeat layers twice, ending with tomatoes on the top.\nBake uncovered in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until corn is tender.",
