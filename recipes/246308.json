    "ins": "Take the two lamb racks and cut them into 1-inch bone chops and set aside.\nWhisk white vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, and salt together in a metal mixing bowl. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time.\nMix together the canola oil and olive oil. Slowly drizzle the blended oil into the egg mixture, whisking constantly until it begins to thicken; this should double in volume with mayo-like consistency. Add salt to taste. Add yuzu juice at the end to desired flavor.\nTurn the skillet on to medium high heat.\nPlace lamb chops on cutting board and season both sides well with the game rub.\nAdd oil to the hot skillet; place chops in hot oil one at a time. Let them cook about 1 1/2 minute per side for a medium rare.\nOnce finished on grill, take off heat and place on platter and top with the yuzu aioli.",
