    "ins": "Heat oven to 400 degrees F.\nCut thin slice off top of garlic head to expose cloves; discard top.  Place garlic head on square sheet of foil; drizzle with oil.  Wrap garlic loosely with foil.  Prick potatoes in several places with fork.  Bake potatoes and garlic 1 hour.\nReduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  Cut small slice off both ends of each potato.  Cut potatoes crosswise in half.  Scoop out centers, leaving 1/8-inch-thick shells.  Place potato flesh in medium bowl; mash.  Squeeze garlic out of papery shell into bowl with potatoes.  Add sour cream, three-fourths of the VELVEETA and the Parmesan cheese; beat until fluffy.  Spoon evenly into shells, mounding filling as necessary to use all the filling; place in shallow baking dish.\nBake 30 min.; top with remaining VELVEETA.  Bake an additional 5 min. or until VELVEETA is melted.  Sprinkle with bacon.",
