    "ins": "Pour the potato rounds into a 9x13 inch glass baking dish. Heat in the microwave for about 2 minutes to thaw. The potato rounds should be cold, but not frozen.\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the cream of chicken soup, Cheddar cheese, and sour cream. Stir in the green beans and ham. Stir this mixture into the potato rounds until evenly blended.\nReturn to the microwave, and cook on high power for 5 minutes, or until heated all of the way through. If you have a high powered microwave, you may want to check on your casserole every two minutes or so. Season with salt and pepper, and serve.",
