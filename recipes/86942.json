    "ins": "Pour the sesame oil into a 9x13 inch baking dish, or any dish large enough to hold your chicken in a single layer. Mix in the garlic and red onion. Lay the chicken breast halves in the dish, and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover the chicken in the dish, and top with sliced zucchini. Season with salt and pepper.\nBake uncovered for 1 hour and 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the chicken during the last 15 minutes of baking.",
