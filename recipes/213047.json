    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix together parsley, garlic, rosemary, thyme, marjoram, and salami. Slice the Brie in half crosswise, so you have two wheels. Spread the salami and herb mixture on one of the cut sides and top with the other half of the Brie wheel. Place the Brie in the center of the sheet of puff pastry. Fold the puff pastry up and over the Brie, pressing to secure the pastry together using a little bit of water if necessary. Brush the pastry with beaten egg.\nBake the pastry in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes before serving.",
