You may need to add a little oil to facilitate blending. Pour over the bowl of prawns, and stir to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours.\nPreheat grill for medium-high heat. Thread prawns onto skewers, piercing each first through the tail, and then the head.\nBrush grill grate with oil. Cook prawns for 5 minutes, turning once, or until opaque.",
