    "des": "\"I'm a Yank. This is a Southern dish. We meet in the middle. Pulled pork shoulder slow-cooked in spices and sauces, great for a low-stress day, potluck, or any get-together. Put it on before work, ready when you get home! Fantastic over a bun, johnnycake, or just by itself.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together the barbecue sauce, ketchup, onion, celery, water, garlic, honey, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper in a slow cooker until thoroughly combined. Place the pork roast into the mixture, spoon sauce over the meat, and set the cooker to Low. Cook 7 to 8 hours; to serve, shred the meat with 2 forks, and serve with sauce.",
