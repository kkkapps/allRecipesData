    "des": "\"I like to add Italian sausage as a topping on my homemade pizza. Came up with this blend after much experimentation. I fry it all and freeze in portions for use as pizza topping. It's ground pork with all fixings to make a simple sausage you can prepare at home.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, combine the ground black pepper, parsley, Italian-style seasoning, garlic powder, crushed red pepper flakes, anise, paprika, minced onion flakes and salt; mix well.\nPlace pork in a separate large bowl and add the spice mix to it. Mix this thoroughly with your hands.\nIn a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the seasoned pork for 10 minutes, or until well browned and crumbly.",
