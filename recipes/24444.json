Roll dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Press a criss cross into the top with a fork.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
