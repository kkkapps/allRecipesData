    "des": "\"I've tried a few different Swedish Meatballs recipes and also the sauce packets they sell at the stores but I've never been happy with the results. One night I really wanted to make Swedish Meatballs, and after looking on multiple websites for recipes, I finally gave up and made up my own. It turned out delicious!\"",

Whisk flour into beef broth until smooth.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs, in batches if necessary, and cook until browned on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low. Pour in beef broth slowly over meatballs. Stir in heavy cream, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
