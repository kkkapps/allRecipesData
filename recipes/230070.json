Pour batter into prepared tube pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool the cake in the tube pan for 15 minutes. Place a serving platter on top of the pan and invert pan. Gently lift pan from cake and let cake finish cooling.\nMelt butter and brown sugar in a saucepan over low heat, stirring until combined. Bring to a boil, stir in milk, and return to a rolling boil.
