    "ins": "Place green beans in a saucepan with one inch of water in the bottom. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook for 5 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Remove from heat, drain, and set aside.\nHeat the bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium heat. Add green beans, and toss to coat. Saute until the beans are heated through. Sprinkle with nuts and crumbled blue cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
