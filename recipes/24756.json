    "ins": "In a lidded, plastic storage container stir butter until it has a smooth, frosting-like consistency.\nSlowly, one tablespoon at a time, stir in the first 1/2 cup of oil; mix until smooth.  Stir in the remaining oil a little more quickly, mixing well.\nRefrigerate for 3 hours, or until set.\nStore in refrigerator.  If the 'butter' melts after being left out, refrigerate to restore solidified quality.",
