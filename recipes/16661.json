    "des": "\"Spinach quiche baked in puff pastry. This is my own creation and is devoured every time it's served up. I hope you enjoy it, it's a little different but very tasty.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a quiche dish with non-stick cooking spray.\nLine the quiche dish with puff pastry, press the pastry firmly in place and trim away any excess pastry. Blind bake for 10 minutes.\nIn a large skillet place spinach and 4 tablespoons water. Heat the mixture over medium and cover the skillet. Cook until the spinach is done, approximately 2 minutes then drain well. Add nutmeg to the spinach and puree the mixture.\nIn a large skillet, saute the onion with butter or margarine to taste. Saute until the onions are soft and transparent.\nIn a medium-size mixing bowl, beat eggs. Stir in the cottage cheese, spinach, and 1/2 cup of cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange onions along the bottom of the pastry-lined quiche dish. Arrange the tomatoes over the onions. Pour the egg-mixture over the onions and tomatoes, and top entire concoction with the remaining cheese.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the quiche has set in the middle. Serve hot or cold, your choice!",
