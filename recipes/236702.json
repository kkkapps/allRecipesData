    "des": "\"You'll notice a glaring lack of ingredients in this recipe. Thanks to the intensely flavored cured lemons, the aioli sauce needs little more than some fresh tarragon to reach its full potential. Having said that, you are well within your rights to toss in some garlic or hot pepper if you're in the mood.\"",
    "ins": "Soak cured lemons briefly in a bowl with cold water to remove curing brine, about 10 minutes. Dry lemons with paper towels and finely mince.\nStir minced lemon, mayonnaise, tarragon, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill aioli in the refrigerator until cold, at least 15 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nPut shrimp in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle paprika and salt over the shrimp, stir to coat shrimp completely.\nCook the shrimp on the preheated grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate and serve with lemon aioli.",
