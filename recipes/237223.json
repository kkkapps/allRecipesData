    "des": "\"Had this at brunch in upstate New York and fell in love from first bite. I had never heard of it before nor seen a recipe, so had to try and record myself!\n Since croissants are naturally buttery, there is less need for butter or syrup as you would traditional French toast. Tastes especially great with either apricot pineapple jam or strawberries as shown.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the griddle with cooking spray.\nWhisk eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Add half-and-half, vanilla extract, and cinnamon to eggs and whisk until frothy.\nDunk croissants, 1 at a time, into egg mixture just until both sides are coated.\nCook croissants on the hot griddle, split-side down, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is golden brown, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining croissants. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar over croissants.",
