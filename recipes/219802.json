    "des": "\"This is a great combination of Mexican flavors with light ingredients. This is a great make-ahead meal. The meatloaf can be assembled the night before and topped with half of the enchilada sauce, then covered and refrigerated overnight. Throw it in the oven the next day for a quick and easy meal.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the ground turkey, ground chicken, black beans, corn, green chiles, salsa, taco seasoning, bread crumbs, and egg whites until thoroughly combined.\nForm the mixture into a loaf shape and place into the prepared baking dish.\nPour half the enchilada sauce over the meatloaf.\nBake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.\nRemove from oven and pour the remaining sauce over the loaf. Return to oven and cook until the meatloaf is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, another 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meat loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nSlice and serve with pan sauce spooned over the slices.",
