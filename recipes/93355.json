Use a 4-inch cookie cutter to cut circles out of crust; gently press each circle into bottom and up the sides of ungreased muffin cup baking pans (crust will not reach top of tin). If necessary, re-roll dough scraps to make additional dough circles.\nCombine cooked sausage with remaining ingredients; mix well. Spoon mixture into each crust, filling about 3/4 full.\nBake 40 minutes or until crust is browned.",
