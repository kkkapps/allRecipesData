    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSeason the squash with salt and pepper. Place the squash halves with the cut side down into a glass baking dish. Pour the water into the dish.\nBake the squash in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Scrape the squash with a fork into a bowl. Save the dish for later use. Keep the oven hot.\nCook the Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the sausage from the skillet, reserving the oil, and set aside to cool. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil to the skillet and allow to get hot; cook and stir the onions and garlic in the hot oil until the garlic is browned and the onions are translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Chop the cooked sausage and add to the mixture along with the squash. Season with the oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer the mixture to the glass baking dish.\nArrange the apple slices over the mixture in the baking dish. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over the apples. Scatter the almonds over the apples and sprinkle with the Monterey Jack cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the the cheese is melted completely, about 15 minutes. Serve hot.",
