Place the potatoes, onion, and green bell pepper in the center of the foil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Then place small pats of the butter or margarine over the vegetables.\nCarefully seal all the edges of the foil around the vegetables to form a packet. (Note: Double wrapping will help to prevent burning.)\nPlace packet on the preheated grill, and grill for 20 minutes. Turn packet, and grill for 10 more minutes.\nCarefully open packet, check for tenderness with a fork. If tender, sprinkle the cheese over the vegetables and allow it to melt. Transfer to a platter, and serve with your main entree.",
