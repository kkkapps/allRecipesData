    "des": "\"This was a dish my mom made. I am from the Caribbean where pumpkin is a savory vegetable. I serve this with pork chops or roasted pork and it always gets rave reviews. If I am in a hurry, I use canned carrots and mash them. \"",
    "ins": "Bring the brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.\nWhen the rice has nearly finished cooking, heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, and cook and stir garlic just until fragrant. Reduce heat to medium, stir in pumpkin, and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Stir in carrots and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in salt and cloves. Remove from heat; stir in the cooked rice until well blended. Serve warm.",
