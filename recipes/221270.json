    "ins": "Season chicken legs with salt on all sides.\nHeat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in skillet over medium heat; place chicken legs in the pan and cook until golden brown on each side, about 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.\nPlace coconut milk, water, garlic, jalapeno peppers, cilantro, and green onion into a blender. Cover and puree until smooth. Set aside.\nHeat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.

Pour pureed coconut mixture, lime juice, fish sauce, and brown sugar over the chicken.\nBring mixture to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, skimming off any fat, until chicken legs are tender, about 45 minutes. Remove chicken from the Dutch oven.\nStir potatoes into coconut milk mixture, increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.
