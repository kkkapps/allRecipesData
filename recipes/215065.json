There have been many imitators, but the original is Wonnie's. You can adjust any of the ingredients to fit your taste. Remember that the onion mix should be one packet per every 2 pounds of ground beef. Serve with your best buns and toppings!\n\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nMix the ground beef, pork sausage, Parmesan cheese, eggs, sweet onion, garlic, onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, kosher salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until evenly incorporated. Shape into 10 patties.\nCook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
