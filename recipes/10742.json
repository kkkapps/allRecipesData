    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.\nCombine flour, baking soda, and spices.  In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar.  Beat in the egg.  Beat in the corn syrup and cider vinegar.  Gradually blend in the dry ingredients.\nOn a floured surface, roll out dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  Using a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut dough into rounds and place 1 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.  Bake for 8-12 minutes--until firm to the touch.  Transfer to wire racks to cool.",
