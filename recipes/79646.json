    "des": "\"This recipe is a favorite of all my friends. Whenever they come over, they want to leave with a jar. Therefore, when I make it I can 14 GALLONS each time. I figure, if I'm gonna spend all day making it, I might as well only do it once a year! I like to serve this salsa with tortillas or use it in cooking. It's great in scrambled eggs and chili.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, green pepper, garlic, jalapenos, sugar, chili powder, vinegar, salt, and cumin in a large saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the salsa is thickened and is noticeably darker in color, at least two hours. Cool and store it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks or in the freezer for three months.",
