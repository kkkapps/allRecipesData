    "des": "\"This recipe is a great twist on the standard apple cobbler. It is really easy to put together. It is so delicious you may want to double it to use the whole bread mix, and make it in a 9x13 inch pan.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the apples and pumpkin butter. Spread evenly in a 8 or 9 inch square baking dish. Pour the pumpkin bread mix into a bowl, and cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over the top of the apples.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the apples are tender enough to insert a fork. Serve warm with whipped cream.",
