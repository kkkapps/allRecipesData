Drain.\nMelt the butter in  a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in the flour until blended, then gradually stir in the milk so that no lumps form. Season with salt, pepper, poultry seasoning and mustard. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and add 2/3 cup cheese and pimento, stirring until cheese melts.  Add undrained mushrooms to cheese sauce.\nPlace a layer of pasta in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Cover with a layer of turkey, and then a layer of cheese sauce.  Repeat the layers.  Sprinkle remaining 1/3 cup cheese over top.\nBake for about 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until sauce is bubbly and cheese on top is toasted.",
