    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.\nBeat eggs and sour cream together in a bowl until smooth.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs mixture until mostly cooked into solid bits with very little moisture remaining, about 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add hot dogs to the eggs and continue cooking until the hot dogs are heated through and the eggs have finished cooking, about 5 minutes more.\nStir drained pasta into the eggs. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the egg and pasta mixture; stir to melt the cheese slightly.",
