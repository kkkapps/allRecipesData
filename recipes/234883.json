    "des": "\"This soup is full of flavor and so healthy! You can adjust the heat by altering the amount of curry paste you use; a little goes a long way. A lemon wedge is the perfect garnish.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, onion, carrots, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPour chicken broth into the saucepan; add basil. Bring broth to a boil, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the basil seasons the broth, about 10 minutes.\nStir kale, curry paste, salt, and pepper into the broth; bring to a boil again, reduce heat to low, and simmer until kale softens, about 10 minutes.\nStir shrimp, tomatoes, kidney beans, and lemon juice into broth; cook at a simmer until shrimp is bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 10 minutes.",
