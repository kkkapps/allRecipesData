    "des": "\"In Germany, cakes made with plum are very popular. This variation can be made as either a whole cake or as individual 'tarts.' I call them 'rolls' due to their appearance.  They are very delicious on a Sunday fall afternoon with a hot cup of tea! They're best when still warm and served with whipped cream!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan.\nPlace a skillet over medium-high heat. Toast the almonds in the hot skillet until they turn brown; set aside to cool.\nCombine the cream cheese, milk, oil, salt, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix in the flour and baking powder; knead together until smooth. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, and roll the dough into a 20-inch square. Spread the plum butter, plums, and toasted almonds over the dough. Roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll. Cut into 12 even slices. Arrange rolls in prepared pan. Brush butter over top of the rolls.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 55 minutes.",
