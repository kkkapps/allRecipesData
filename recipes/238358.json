    "des": "\"This is a recipe I created after receiving a deep fryer for Christmas. These come out tasting just like little mini apple pies or apple empanadas. \n\nBeware: this recipe can get messy, so you will want to make sure you have extra paper towels waiting in the wings.\"",
    "ins": "Stir apples, Brie cheese, 20 crushed vanilla wafers, honey, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold, at least 15 minutes.\nBeat egg until frothy in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Gradually add flour, milk, confectioners' sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt; beat until batter is thick and smooth, adding more flour as necessary to reach desired consistency.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPour 20 crushed vanilla wafers into a shallow bowl.\nRoll apple mixture into small balls. Drop balls into funnel cake batter and turn to coat completely. Roll coated balls in crushed vanilla wafers. Place the coated apple balls onto a plate while coating the rest; do not stack.\nWorking in batches, fry apple-brie bites in hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked apple-brie bites to a paper-towel lined plate to drain and cool.",
