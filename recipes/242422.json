    "des": "\"Easy recipe for the non-culinary school folks who just like to eat artichokes. Boil and grill. This is a recipe from trial and error, so some culinary people may have issues with how long it's cooked, etc. But it's just, plain good this way. My wife and and I just can't eat artichokes any other way now. Read the recipe, then be sure to look at any comments for any improvement or preferable changes. Lawry's\u00c2\u00ae isn't necessary, but adds some flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Trim artichoke stem and about 3/4 inch of the top using a knife. Trim thorns from leaves using scissors.\nPlace artichoke into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, at least 1 hour. Drain and cool artichoke, 15 to 30 minutes.\nPreheat grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nRemove leaves from artichoke and scrape the hairy part from heart using a spoon with light pressure; discard hair. Place leaves and heart into a vegetable griller. Sprinkle butter over leaves and heart; season with garlic powder and seasoned salt.\nPlace griller on the preheated grill and cook, shaking griller occasionally, until edges of leaves are charred, about 10 minutes.",
