Mix to coat. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and combine well. Dough will be very stiff and may require mixing with your hands. Place dough into the prepared pan.\nBake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Mix the orange juice and confectioners' sugar together and pour over the hot cake. Let cake stand in pan overnight before serving.",
