    "des": "\"Delicata squash is a small oblong squash that has pale yellow skin with dark green stripes. It's sweet and smooth enough to eat plain, but the flavor really pops with this medley of shrimp and veggies. This recipe was a clean-out-my-freezer concoction that turned out to be tasty. For a light colorful meal, serve with a salad of mixed baby greens, cucumber, and toasted pine nuts.\"",
    "ins": "Place squash halves, hollow-side down, into a microwave-safe dish; pour in water. Cover with a paper towel or microwave-safe lid.\nMicrowave squash until tender, about 15 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and bell pepper in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add shrimp, corn, and peas; cook until shrimp is  is no longer transparent in the center and water has evaporated from frozen vegetables, about 5 minutes. Season with curry powder, salt, and pepper.\nScoop shrimp mixture into squash halves.",
