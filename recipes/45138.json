    "des": "\"Inspired by Mongolian Beef and the Korean short ribs my grandfather always made for special occasions. Have your butcher trim, split, and debone a whole leg of lamb for you. Make the marinade (also good on ribs, or steak, or pork). Marinate overnight. Grill the meat to desired doneness. Slice to serve. We like it wrapped in tortillas or flatbreads with leaves of butter lettuce.\"",
    "ins": "In a large resealable plastic bag, mix hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, green onions, mushroom soy sauce, garlic, honey, sesame oil, sesame seeds, white pepper, and black pepper. Place lamb in bag, seal, and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat grill for high heat.\nOil the grill grate. Place lamb on the grill, and discard marinade. Cook 15 minutes on each side, to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), or to desired doneness. Transfer meat to a serving platter, and allow it to rest for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.",
