    "ins": "Process Pretzel Crisps(R) into crumbs in a food processor. Transfer to a bowl and pour in melted butter; mix to combine evenly. Butter a pie dish, then press crumbs into dish to cover bottom and sides. Place in refrigerator.\nIn mixer, lightly whisk 8 egg yolks. Add heavy cream, sugar and vanilla bean seeds. Whisk on medium to incorporate air. Pour into chilled pie crust.\nBake at 350 degrees F for about an hour. (If top skin is browning too quickly, use a spoon to skim it off the top and continue to bake.) Pie is finished when center appears to be set, and only jiggles slightly. Remove and cool, then place in refrigerator to cool completely.",
