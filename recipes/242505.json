Remove skillet from heat, adding more butter to asparagus to taste.\nSeason salmon with salt and black pepper; cook with the asparagus over medium heat until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side. Remove skillet from heat and chop salmon into small pieces.\nBeat eggs and cream cheese together in a bowl until smooth; add half-and-half and stir.\nSpoon salmon and asparagus into pie crust and pour in egg mixture, filling almost to the rim. Set pie plate on a baking sheet.\nPlace baking sheet on the lower rack in the preheated oven and cook until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Let quiche set for 10 minutes before slicing.",
