Cover with a layer of the crab and tuna, then a layer of cheese and a sprinkle of parsley. Repeat layers 2 more times ending with cheese and parsley on top.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, butter, mustard powder and onion. Pour over the layers in the dish. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Let the dish come to room temperature while the oven preheats.\nBake uncovered for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until puffed and golden.",
