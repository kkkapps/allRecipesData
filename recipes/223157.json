    "des": "\"Spicy and smoky beef brisket. My version has no BBQ sauce added. Keep the dish tightly covered during cooking and don't peek. This prevents the brisket from drying out. If you use a larger or smaller brisket, adjust the cooking time to 1 hour per pound. Cut the brisket against the grain with a sharp knife, or it will be stringy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nPlace the brisket in a glass baking dish, fatty-side down.\nMix Montreal steak seasoning and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl; rub over the brisket firmly to press into the meat. Flip the brisket and continue seasoning the fatty side.\nStir beef stock, lemon juice, and liquid smoke together in the bowl; drizzle over the seasoned brisket. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.\nRoast in the preheated oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 5 hours. Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.",
