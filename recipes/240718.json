    "des": "\"The salmon and olive oil in this recipe contain heart healthy omega 3 and monounsaturated fatty acids. This dish comes together with a sweet and tangy balsamic vinaigrette, but you can shortcut the prep by using any favourite bottled balsamic dressing.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Add the green beans 4 minutes before draining.\nWhisk the vinegar with the syrup, mustard, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) each salt and pepper until combined. Whisk in the olive oil until well combined. Measure out and reserve 2 tablespoon (30 mL) of the dressing. Toss the hot cooked noodles and beans with the onion, red pepper, basil and remaining dressing.\nMeanwhile, lightly coat a nonstick pan with cooking spray and set over medium heat. Season the salmon with the remaining salt and pepper. Add the salmon and cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until just a hint of coral remains. Brush salmon with reserved dressing. Serve the noodle mixture topped with a piece of salmon.",
