    "des": "\"This is one of those little gems of ingenuity from my Nana's kitchen. Nana always made this every Thanksgiving, and all of us kids took turns helping her make it. It is a simple dish, but it really hits the spot on a cold November day. I remember how my sister was absolutely shocked when she learned there was tuna in this dish. This is definitely a dish you'll want to make again and again.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nMix the tuna, cereal, onion, mushroom soup, and olive oil together in a bowl until blended. Spoon mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with cheese and peanuts.\nBake in preheated oven until cheese melts, about 30 minutes. Cut into squares to serve.",
