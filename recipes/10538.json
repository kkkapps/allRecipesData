    "des": "\"This is a Scottish Shortbread that I have created by trial and error.  It is a favorite of my family and friends.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace butter (not softened) in a large mixing bowl.  Add flour, sugar and corn starch. Mix with hands (do not use a mixer) until blended and most of dough is like course cornmeal.  It will be very lumpy.\nSpread a portion of the dough into the bottom of a glass pie pan and press firmly into the pan.  Add dough until the thickness is about 1/2 inch thick.\nPlace in oven and bake until edges are golden brown.  Remove from oven and use a fork to create perforations.  Shortbread will break easily when cooled.  Remove from pie pan by placing a plate to cover, then flipping over - shortbread will fall out in one piece.",
