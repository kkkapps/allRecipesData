    "des": "\"An easy recipe for baked brie. The gooey brie mixed with the crunchy phyllo and the tangy mango chutney makes the perfect appetizer or party pleaser!  It wows company every time I make it. Red pepper jelly also works well instead of the mango chutney.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace on sheet of phyllo on your work surface.  Brush with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Lay a second sheet on top of the first, and brush with an additional tablespoon of olive oil.  Place the third sheet on top.  Place the brie towards the middle of one of the narrow edges of phyllo dough and roll up.  Fold the ends of the phyllo under the brie, place onto a baking sheet, and brush with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.\nBake in preheated oven until phyllo is golden, about 15 minutes.  Place onto serving platter, and spoon the mango chutney over top.",
