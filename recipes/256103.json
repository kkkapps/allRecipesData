Drizzle 1 teaspoon peanut oil over each pile of shrimp; lay 1 lime slice on top.\nFold empty half of parchment over shrimp filling and crimp edges together with overlapping folds to seal. Arrange packets close together on a sheet pan.\nRoast on the center rack of the preheated oven until shrimp are tender and opaque, 15 to 17 minutes. Unfold 1 edge of the parchment, being careful to avoid steam, and look inside to check doneness.\nOpen packets carefully, being careful to avoid steam. Slide shrimp and rice mixture into bowls.
