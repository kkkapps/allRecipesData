    "des": "\"Turkey drumsticks are a thrifty food, rich in flavor. Here's a relatively easy, very satisfying recipe. If you're feeling skinny, use sour cream instead of the mushroom soup. Serve over pasta or rice.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix olive oil and paprika in a roasting pan to form a paste. Place lid on roasting pan or cover with aluminum foil.\nBake paprika paste in preheated oven until fragrant, about 15 minutes. Stir onion and pepper into paprika mixture; add turkey drumsticks, turning to coat. Cover roasting pan with a lid or aluminum foil and return to oven.\nContinue baking until turkey is very tender and meat falls away from the bone, 4 to 5 hours. Remove bones, leaving meat in pan, and stir in cream of mushroom soup and white wine. Simmer mixture over medium heat until hot, about 5 minutes.",
