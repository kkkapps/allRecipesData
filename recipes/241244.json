Just yummmm! \nMom served it with Bisquick\u00c2\u00ae brown sugar rolls, but a salad with any bread, roll, or crackers would be equally perfect!\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onions in hot butter until soft, about 5 minutes.\nPour 1 cup water in the skillet and bring to a simmer. Lay fillets into the water and poach until fish flesh can be gently broken with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove fish and onions from the skillet with a slotted spoon to a bowl.\nPour remaining 1/4 cup water into the skillet with the potato cubes; season with salt. Place a cover on the skillet and bring the liquid to a boil; cook until the potatoes are beginning to soften, but remain firm, 5 to 7 minutes.\nReturn fish and onion to the skillet; add whole milk and evaporated milk. Season everything with salt and pepper; heat until just before the liquid comes to a boil and remove immediately from heat.",
