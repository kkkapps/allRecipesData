    "des": "\"We have all had those days when we have a cold and can't kick its butt. Where our throat is achy and it hurts to swallow. This is a recipe I have developed in the last couple of days. I think I now have the perfect balance of home-remedy qualities and flavor. The honey coats your throat and helps to sooth it. The citrus actually reduces the swelling and adds a great deal of flavor. For all of you who are suffering with a sore throat, get well soon. I hope you like it.\"",
