    "des": "\"This is a great tasting garlic butter smeared on loves of Italian bread and broiled to a crunchy golden delight! Also great with cheese! Simply add cheese after broiling and return to oven until cheese is bubbly. Store any unused garlic butter smear in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Whip the butter, olive oil, celery salt, poultry seasoning, cumin, onion powder, and garlic powder together until light and fluffy. Cover; refrigerate at least 4 hours. Allow the mixture to return to room temperature before using.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nOpen the loaves of Italian bread with your fingers (do not use a knife) by pulling edges and ripping the bread into two equal portions (top and bottom). Spread the garlic butter evenly over the torn sides of the bread and place buttered-side-up onto a baking sheet.\nBroil in the preheated oven until golden brown and crunchy on top, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve hot.",
