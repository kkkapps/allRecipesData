    "ins": "In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat.  Cook red pepper and onion  in oil, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.\nStir in tequila, water, lime juice, fresh pepper and jalapenos. Bring to a boil, and dump in the mussels. Sprinkle the cilantro over the mussels, and cover with a tight fitting lid. Allow to steam for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all mussels have opened (discard any that don't).",
