My niece, who is of Spanish descent, lives with us and has tweaked my old Spanish rice recipe to make it just like her grandma's. My mother-in-law has also added this recipe to her school meals menu (minus the jalapeno), and it is a hit with the students and faculty.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions and jalapeno peppers in the butter until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir Mexican-style tomatoes into onion mixture; add rice, salt, and black pepper. Bring rice mixture to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is cooked, 40 to 45 minutes. Garnish with sour cream and Cheddar cheese to serve.",
