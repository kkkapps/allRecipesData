    "des": "\"This recipe was made with the paleo 'diet' in mind. It's gluten-free, dairy-free, and has no added sugar. I needed an alternative to other paleo breakfasts since I also cannot have eggs. This is the result. \n\nThose with fewer restrictions might enjoy stirring in a bit of maple syrup, adding brown sugar, or topping with granola for extra crunch.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace butternut squash halves, cut-side up, in a baking dish; fill dish with 1/4 inch of water.\nBake in the preheated oven until softened, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool squash.\nScoop squash flesh into a bowl and mash with a fork or potato masher until smooth. Stir coconut milk and cinnamon into squash; top with walnuts.",
