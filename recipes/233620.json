    "des": "\"This is the best and most basic way to ensure a juicy, perfectly-cooked pork roast every time. This recipe really requires a good thermometer -- either a $10 instant-read type or, even better, the type that pierces the meat and stays in place while connected to an outside-the-oven monitor. If you can swing that, then try your favorite marinade or rub on this recipe. Use your imagination on the rubs and marinades, but ensure you bring your roast directly from the fridge to the roasting pan -- Dad's recipe works best that way.\"",
    "ins": "Combine oil, pepper, and salt in a bowl; rub oil mixture over pork and refrigerate while oven preheats.\nPreheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).\nPlace a roasting rack in a large roasting pan; arrange pork on the roasting rack.\nRoast in preheated oven until pork with browned, about 30 minutes. Remove pork from oven and reduce oven heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Allow pork to rest uncovered at room temperature for 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) and 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).\nReturn to oven and continue to cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, 15 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nLet the roast stand uncovered at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing and serving.",
