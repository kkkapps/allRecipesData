    "ins": "Dissolve the cherry gelatin in 1 cup of boiling water. When dissolved, stir in 1/2 cup of cold water and pour into an eight or nine inch square pan. Refrigerate until firm. Repeat this process with the lime and orange flavors.\nIn a small sauce pan, mix together the lemon gelatin with the pineapple syrup. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring constantly. When the gelatin is dissolved, set aside and allow to cool to room temperature until thick.\nOnce the cherry, lime, and orange gelatin is firm, cut into 1 to 2  inch cubes. Beat the whip cream into stiff peaks, and fold it into the lemon pineapple mixture. Fold the gelatin cubes into the whipped cream mixture.\nPour the gelatin and whipped cream mixture into a buttered and graham cracker crumb dusted 9 inch tube pan. Chill for several hours before unmolding.",
