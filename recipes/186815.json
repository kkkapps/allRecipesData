    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nBeat the eggs and ranch dressing together in a bowl; set aside. Stir together the bread crumbs, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until evenly combined. Dip the chicken thighs into the egg mixture, then press into the breadcrumbs to coat all sides; place the chicken onto the prepared baking sheet.\nCook the chicken thighs until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 50 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
