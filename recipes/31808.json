    "des": "\"A truly delicious meal for anyone who loves pheasant. This recipe makes very traditional-tasting, moist cooked bird.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large Dutch oven, over medium heat, brown the pheasants in the safflower oil on all sides. Tuck the sliced apples and onions in around the pheasants. Pour the apple jack over all and light it on fire. Shake pan until flames subside. Dust the tops of the pheasants with nutmeg.\nBake covered for about 1 hour, or until the juices run clear when a knife is inserted into the thigh. Remove the Pheasants, apples and onions to a platter and keep warm in the oven.\nTransfer juices to a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the half-and-half and let simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt-free seasoning blend and ground black pepper. Pour over the pheasants and serve.",
