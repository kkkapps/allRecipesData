    "des": "\"This is a delicious simple sauce which goes with anything. You can have it plain over pasta or make lasagna with it.  You can make ziti or spaghetti and meatballs (just cook the meatballs in the sauce - it will take longer) or anything you can think of.  It makes good, slightly too bland, pizza sauce.  You can triple the batch and freeze it in jars.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, blend the whole tomatoes and paste; reserve.\nIn a large saucepan, warm olive oil over medium-low heat and add garlic; cook for a few minutes, but make sure to not brown the garlic.\nPour tomato mixture in saucepan and stir; cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Add parsley, salt and wine; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens; serve.",
