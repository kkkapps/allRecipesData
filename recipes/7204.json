Beat in one egg, and then the other. Beat for 1 minute.\nBeginning with the flour mixture, alternately add the milk and flour to the large bowl with the creamed butter and sugar. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated.\nSpoon batter into a greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.\nBake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 50 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
