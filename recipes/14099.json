Spread seeds out in a single layer and cool to room temperature.\nWhile cooling, combine juice and garlic in a small bowl. Set aside.\nPut seeds in food processor or hand held blender along with the juice mixture, soy sauce, celery, minced onion and water; blend until the mixture is fairly fine.  Cover and refrigerate if not using the spread within 15 minutes. If spread firms up mix in a tablespoon of water.",
