    "des": "\"A wonderful New England creation, merging the sweetness of parsnips with a smoky cod broth.  Good fish alternatives include haddock, pollack, cusk, or whiting.  Smoked haddock and smoked pollack are good substitutes for the smoked cod.  Use 1 1/2 pounds fresh cod alone if no lightly smoked fish is available.  Great on cool Autumn evenings!  Serve with hot, crusty bread and garnish with fresh chives.\"",
    "ins": "If the smoked cod has a strong smoky flavor, soak it in water for 30 minutes, drain, and rinse.\nIn a large saucepan, cover the cod and smoked cod with water, and add the juice of half a lemon and the thyme.  Bring the cooking liquid to a gentle simmer.  Poach the fish for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked and tender.  Remove the fish to a bowl, and reserve the poaching liquid.  When the fish has cooled enough to handle, break it into large bite-sized pieces.  Set aside.\nWhile the cod is cooking, peel the parsnips, and cut them into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Peel the potatoes, cut them into 1/2 inch dice, and place them in a bowl of water to prevent discoloring.\nIn a large saucepan or kettle, melt 2 tablespoons of butter or margarine over medium heat.  Add onion, and cook until wilted and golden.  Add the parsnips, potatoes, and 3 cups of the reserved poaching liquid.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and cover.  Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.\nHeat the milk and cream in a small saucepan.  Do not boil.  Stir to the vegetable mixture.\nAdd cod and smoked cod; stir.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Just before serving, stir in remaining tablespoon of butter.  Top each serving with freshly ground pepper and chives.",
