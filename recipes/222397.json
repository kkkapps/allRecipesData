    "des": "\"Homemade cranberry sauce is very easy and, as long as you sell it properly, your true motives (maximum love for minimum effort) will be our secret. By sell it, I mean tell all about your secret tangerine/cherry-spiked version sauce, and how involved it is to make. Of course, since it is a top-secret recipe, you'll not be able to give details, but you're sure they'll be blown away.\"",
    "ins": "Combine cranberries, cherries, sugar, tangerine juice, tangerine zest, star anise, cinnamon stick, and whole cloves in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until cranberries are all popped, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Discard star anise, cinnamon stick, and whole cloves, and refrigerate until needed.",
