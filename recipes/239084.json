    "des": "\"Here's a classic recipe for silky-smooth, deeply-flavored gravy that will have guest s\nsinging your praises! It makes enough for the table and the turkey leftovers. If \n\ngiblets aren't your thing or your bird came without them, skip to step 3 and prepare as \n\ndirected, substituting canned broth for the homemade giblet broth. Keep warm until serving, whisking occasionally.\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir giblets and onion until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add 6 cups water to onion mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer until liquid is reduced by 1/3 and meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.\nStrain broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a measuring cup to measure 4 cups. Add more water if needed to make 4 cups.\nPlace the turkey roasting pan with drippings over 2 burners on low heat; add 1 cup water and stir to release brown bits of food.\nPour drippings into a fat separator or a small bowl and allow fat to rise to the top; skim off excess fat and transfer to a 1-cup measuring cup. Fat should equal 3/4 cup; add butter if needed to get to 3/4 cup fat. Strain liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a 2-cup measuring cup, adding more water to equal 2 cups if needed.\nCombine the 2 cups drippings liquid and 4 cups broth in a bowl and cool.\nHeat fat in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour until mixture is smooth and light brown, about 2 minutes. Gradually mix broth mixture into fat mixture using a whisk until smooth; bring to a boil and cook at a full boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until gravy is thickened about 15 minutes. Season gravy with salt and pepper.",
