    "des": "\"This recipe uses orange-flavored liqueur, which 'wakes up' the flavor of the blueberries.  It is wonderful on a hot summer day.  Fresh blueberries during July - the peak season - are the best.\"",
    "ins": "In a  large saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, salt, and water. Mix well, then add 1 cup blueberries. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Boil and stir until very thick, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.\nStir butter or margarine, lemon juice, and liqueur into mixture. Allow to cool. Stir in remaining 2 cups blueberries. Chill mixture 1 hour. Spoon into pastry shell and refrigerate at least 2 more hours before serving. Garnish with whipped cream if desired.",
