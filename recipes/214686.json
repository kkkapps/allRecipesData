    "des": "\"These banana bars are sweet and moist. They are a favorite among my friends and family. I recommend eating them when they are still warm or letting them sit in the fridge to cool for a few hours. Enjoy! You can substitute butter in even amounts for the margarine.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nCombine the milk and lemon juice in a small bowl; allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. This will effectively 'sour' the milk.\nStir the 1/2 cup margarine, the white sugar, eggs, salt, and flour together in a bowl. Add the soured milk and mashed bananas and mix thoroughly; spread into the bottom of the prepared dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown very slightly, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool at least 10 minutes before frosting.\nPrepare the frosting by beating together the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1/3 cup margarine in a bowl using an electric mixer. Spread evenly over the cooled bars before cutting into 20 even-sized pieces. Serve immediately or store in refrigerator.",
