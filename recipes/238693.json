    "des": "\"My husband is Puerto Rican and wanted me to make this! \n\n'Tembleque,' which means 'wiggly,' is a creamy coconut pudding.\"",
    "ins": "Stir coconut milk, sugar, and salt together in a saucepan. Spoon a few tablespoons of the coconut milk mixture into a small bowl and stir cornstarch into the mixture to dissolve; pour into the mixture in the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring constantly; cook until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes.\nPour the coconut milk mixture into molds, cover each with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold and firm, 3 hours to 2 days.\nRun a thin knife around the edges of the mold and invert onto a plate to remove putting. Garnish tops with cinnamon.",
