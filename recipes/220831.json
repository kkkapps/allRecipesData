    "des": "\"Combining wild rice, mushrooms, nuts, green onions, and sour cream, my father's recipe goes very well with any game dish. The recipe calls for fresh or dried morel mushrooms, which give the recipe its best flavor, but any type of mushroom, fresh or dried, should work well. Similarly, he always used chestnuts, but we have found that pecans and hazelnuts (and, probably walnuts or cashews) work just as well. Preparation time depends on whether one is using dried mushrooms or not.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water, wild rice, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a heavy saucepan; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the wild rice is tender, 30 to 45 minutes.\nStir morel mushrooms, chestnuts, and 2 chopped green onions into the rice; simmer until mushrooms and green onions are tender, another 15 minutes.\nDrain any excess liquid. Mix sour cream and 1 chopped green onion into wild rice mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Serve immediately.",
