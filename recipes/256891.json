    "des": "\"These spicy lobster tails are so easy to make. Just a note on the lobster tails in supermarkets: if they're not frozen, they've been frozen and then thawed. So, bypass the 'fresh' for the frozen, which are fresher.\"",
    "ins": "Mix mayonnaise, tarragon, sriracha sauce, paprika, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a bowl.\nPreheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Set oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nLoosen lobster meat from the shell, leaving it attached near the tip of the tail. Place tails on a baking sheet lined with crinkled aluminum foil to help keep them in place.\nSpoon some of the mayonnaise mixture beneath the lobster meat and spread a generous amount on top.\nBroil in the preheated oven until lobster tails are browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.",
