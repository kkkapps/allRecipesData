    "ins": "Heat 1/4 cup evaporated milk in a small saucepan until simmering, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add chocolate chips; let stand until chocolate melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk in butter, fig jam, and cinnamon until filling is thick and smooth.\nWhisk pancake mix, 3/4 cup evaporated milk, and egg together in a bowl until no lumps remain. Add water gradually until batter reaches a thin consistency. Stir in vanilla extract.\nHeat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray. Spoon batter into a thin layer at the bottom of the skillet. Cook until set, about 2 minutes. Lift up the sides with a spatula and flip; cook until second side is set, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate; repeat with remaining batter.\nSpoon filling into the center of the crepes; fold or roll crepes to enclose filling.",
