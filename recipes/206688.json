    "ins": "Mix the beef, sun-dried tomato, green onions, garlic, bell pepper, egg, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl using your hands to assure the ingredients are equally integrated. Form into 8 1/2-inch thick patties.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the burgers in the hot skillet until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 5 to 6 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on the toasted English muffins.",
