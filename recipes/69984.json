    "des": "\"I made these cookies waaay back when in Home Economics class at Venice High School in L.A., California. With a shortbread texture blended with walnuts and cherries, these are certainly unforgettable.  I usually bake them around Christmas, but they are super any time of year.  They are particularly great with a hot cup of coffee, I hope you enjoy these as much as my family does!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, mix together the butter, vanilla and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Mix in salt, then stir in flour by hand until dough is stiff. Add the walnuts and cherries, and mix into the dough, kneading like bread on a clean floured surface.\nRoll dough into ping pong sized balls, and place onto ungreased cookie sheets. Press down balls with a fork to make a criss cross pattern on top.\nBake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven. Let stand on the baking sheet for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
