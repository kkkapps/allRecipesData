    "ins": "Coat corned beef with spicy brown mustard and place, fat-side down, into a slow cooker. Add garlic and seasoning packet to corned beef; pour in beer, covering beef completely.\nCook on Low for 8 hours. Remove corned beef from slow cooker and allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing across the grain.",
