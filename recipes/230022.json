    "ins": "Set aside 1 cup of cookie crumbs and mix remaining crumbs with melted butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish; press buttered crumbs into the dish to form a crust. Freeze until set, about 10 minutes.\nWhisk coconut cream pudding mix with milk in a large bowl until the pudding thickens, about 2 minutes. Stir ice cream into pudding mix and pour mixture into the cookie crust. Top with a layer of frozen whipped topping; sprinkle with reserved cookie crumbs and coconut. Refrigerate until set, about 1 1/2 hours.",
