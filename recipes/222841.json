    "des": "\"This was my Grandma Moyer's recipe. It has been missing since at least the mid 80's. I found it stuck the middle of an old book I got after my mom passed away. Everyone in the family has been trying to recreate this delicious coffee cake for years. It is moist and very flavorful. I added the strawberries because I like it a little sweeter. Rhubarb is an ingredient that you don't see used very often any more, but those of us who do use it always love to find new ways to spread the love.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.\nBeat white sugar and eggs together in a large bowl until smooth; mix in coffee. Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl. Beat the dry ingredients into the moist ingredients just until combined; stir rhubarb and strawberries into the batter. Pour batter into prepared cake pan and sprinkle top with brown sugar and pecans.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.",
