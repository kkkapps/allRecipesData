    "des": "\"I use an old large slow cooker for my mixing bowl, this way I don't need to dirty up a bunch of different bowls or counters. The soybeans and quinoa give this bread great texture. I use an electric coffee grinder to grind up the soybeans.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl or crock pot, dissolve yeast and 1 cup flour in water. Cover with plastic wrap or a pot lid and let stand for 2 hours.\nCoarsely grind the soybeans in a food processor or blender. Stir soy beans and 1 cup flour into the yeast mixture. Let stand for 2 hours.\nStir in the salt and remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out of the slow cooker and knead 1 1/2 tablespoons quinoa into the dough. Form into a loaf and place in a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Sprinkle the remaining quinoa on top of the loaf. Brush or drizzle on the olive oil. Cover and let rise until loaf is just above the top of the loaf pan. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let cool before slicing.",
