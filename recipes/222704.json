    "ins": "Whisk olive oil, onion powder, sea salt, paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl to make the marinade.\nPlace chicken in a large bowl. Pour marinade over the chicken. Marinate in refrigerator at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nWhisk Dijon mustard, heavy cream, barbeque sauce, rosemary, and garlic together in a bowl.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the bacon in the pan until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving bacon drippings in the skillet.\nRemove chicken from marinade, shaking to remove any excess moisture. Discard marinade.\nCook the chicken in the bacon drippings until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Brush the mustard sauce over both sides of the chicken; cook another 2 minutes per side. Pour about half the white wine over the chicken; allow the mixture to simmer until the wine reduces, about 10 minutes.\nRemove chicken to a baking dish; top with the bacon and remaining white wine.\nBake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from oven and allow to rest about 5 minutes before slicing to serve.",
