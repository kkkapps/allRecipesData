    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).\nCoarsely chop the hazelnuts.  In a bowl, combine the nuts, sugar, butter, liqueur and eggs; mix well.  Stir in the flour, baking powder and salt.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead briefly; then form into a long loaf about 2 inches wide.  Place the loaf on a parchment-lined or lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake in the middle of the oven for 25 min. or until firm.  The loaf will have a cakelike texture.  Remove from the oven and cool.\nCut the loaf diagonally into 1/4-1/2 inch slices and lay those out on a cookie sheet. Bake for 20 minutes more, turning them once until both sides are lightly browned and toasted.  Cool and store in an airtight container.",
