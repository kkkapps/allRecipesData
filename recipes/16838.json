    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium heat, saute the onion and garlic for 10 to 15 minutes, or until onion is caramelized. Reduce heat to low and pour in about 1 cup of bourbon to deglaze the pan. Return saucepan to medium high heat, add the remaining bourbon, and bring to a slow boil for 5 to 10 minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook out of the bourbon.\nAdd the honey, picante sauce, hot pepper sauce, tomato paste, tomato-vegetable juice and ground black pepper and stir well. Bring this mixture to a slow, rolling boil for about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and cool in the refrigerator.\nMarinate your meat in a separate large, nonporous bowl for 3 to 4 hours, pouring sauce over meat. Boil remaining sauce for 10 minutes and serve with meat, if desired. Discard any excess marinade.",
