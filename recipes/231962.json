    "ins": "Pour orange juice, vinegar, olive oil, soy sauce, and lime juice into a blender; add onions, Scotch bonnet chiles, garlic, sugar, thyme, allspice, salt, black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Pulse several times to mix ingredients, then blend until jerk marinade is pureed.\nSet 1/2 cup marinade aside in a small bowl and refrigerate. Place chicken breasts into a large nonreactive bowl and pour remaining jerk sauce over chicken; stir to coat. Refrigerate chicken in marinade 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove chicken from marinade, discarding used marinade. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until meat is no longer pink inside, the skin is browned, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast, not touching bone, reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes. Baste chicken with reserved 1/2 cup of marinade as it cooks, turning chicken occasionally.",
