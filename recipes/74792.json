    "des": "\"A traditional holiday favorite in my family, this creamed pearl onion recipe is a surprising treat to the palate. Chopped dry roasted peanuts mingle with the cream sauce and onions, while the bread crumb topping gives it a nice bit of added texture. My sister used to bake this at every holiday meal she hosted, and since we've lost her, it has a special meaning :).\"",

Gradually blend the milk into the saucepan until thickened. Place the onions and nuts in a medium casserole dish. Pour the sauce over the onions and nuts, and toss to coat.\nIn a separate saucepan, melt the remaining butter, and toss with the bread crumbs to coat. Sprinkle over the casserole.\nBake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.",
