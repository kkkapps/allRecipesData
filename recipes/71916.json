Cook livers for 5 minutes, turning frequently.\nStir tomatoes and wine into the skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until most of the liquid is gone. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\nMeanwhile, pour chicken stock into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Slowly pour in polenta while stirring vigorously. Cook for a few minutes, then stir in milk. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 5 minutes, until thick. Stir gorgonzola into the polenta until melted.\nSpoon polenta onto plates, and cover with the chicken liver sauce.",
