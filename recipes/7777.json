    "ins": "Prepare and bake marble cake as directed on the box.\nPoke holes in the cooled cake with a fork.  Dissolve the strawberry gelatin in 1 cup  boiling water.   Pour the gelatin over the cake, and refrigerate for 2 1/2 hours.\nCombine whipped topping, vanilla pudding, milk, and vanilla in a mixing bowl.  Mix with an electric mixer on high speed for 3 to 5 minutes, until frosting is thick enough for spreading.  Frost the cake, and serve.  Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.",
