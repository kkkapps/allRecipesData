    "des": "\"I grew up in a Catholic family, when Catholics could not eat meat on Fridays. Fish and a side dish were Friday meals. One particularly favorite side-dish was this recipe. Hearty, filling and delicious! Cubed ham and finely chopped onions can be added to the potato and cheese mixture if you want more of a one-dish meal. Use American, muenster, havarti, or brie cheese. Happy cooking!\"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mash the potatoes with 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, salt, and black pepper to make medium-stiff mashed potatoes; stir in the American cheese.\nPreheat  oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nFit a crust into a 9-inch pie dish, and fill with the potato mixture. Place the top crust on the pie, roll the edges together and crimp with a fork to seal. Stir the melted butter and 2 teaspoons of milk together in a small bowl, and brush the mixture all over the pie crust. Cut several vent holes in the top of the crust.\nBake the pie in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes; if the edges are getting too brown, wrap them in aluminum foil.",
