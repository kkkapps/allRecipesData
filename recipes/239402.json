    "des": "\"I combined a few gluten-free recipes to make these pancakes. They are super-high in protein and sweet enough to eat without any toppings, though I usually chop some strawberries or blueberries to top them! Feel free to add chopped fruit, syrup, or whipped cream to top your pancakes!\"",
