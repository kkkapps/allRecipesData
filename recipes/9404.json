Bring to boil stirring occasionally until the peaches can be pierced to the pit with a fork.\nFill sterilized canning jars with peaches.  Continue boiling syrup until heavy and add to peaches to cover.\nIn a large stock pot, pour water half way to top with boiling water. Using a holder, carefully lower jars into pot. Leave a 2-inch space between jars. Add more boiling water to cover them, about 2 inches above the tops.  Bring to a boil and cover, processing for 35 minutes. Remove jars from pot. Put jars on a wood or cloth surface, several inches apart and allow to cool. Jars will be sealed.",
