    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until the onion begins to turn translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.\nStir salt, cinnamon, cloves, cumin, cayenne pepper, and celery seed into the onion mixture; continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is completely softened, 2 to 3 minutes more.\nStir blueberries and brown sugar into the onion mixture. Mash the berries as they cook until completely softened, about 10 minutes.\nBlend the blueberry mixture with an immersion blender until the mixture is thick with no large chunks. Stir balsamic vinegar into blueberry mixture, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until thickened to your liking, 10 to 15 minutes more.",
