    "des": "\"This fresh, delicious, and healthy dish is loved by everyone at first bite. It is made with forbidden rice, which has been eaten in China for centuries. It's full of fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and flavor. It somehow manages to give one a sense of well-being, peace, and energy at the same time. It is filling without leaving you with a feeling of being stuffed. Delicious! Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and rice to a boil in a pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer rice to a large bowl, fluff with a fork, and cool until just warm.\nWhisk rice vinegar, tamari, sesame oil, mirin, sriracha sauce, and agave nectar together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over cooled rice; stir.\nStir carrots, cashews, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, scallions, Thai basil, purple basil, and jalapeno into rice until evenly distributed.",
