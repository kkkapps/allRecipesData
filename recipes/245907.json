    "des": "\"If you are interested in making your own herbal medicines or handmade gifts, infused oils are the perfect way to begin. They are simple to create, absolutely decadent to use and the whole process will make your house smell like heaven. This is fun to do and would be a great experiment to do with your kiddos for a summer project.\"",

Dry according to manufacturer's instructions, rotating every 20 to 30 minutes, until crisp and fragrant, about 2 hours.\nBreak up dried ginger into smaller pieces; transfer to a saucepan. Add coconut oil; heat gently over low heat until natural oils from ginger infuse the oil, at least 2 hours.\nStrain ginger oil through a strainer to remove large pieces. Wrap cheesecloth over top of a glass jar. Pour ginger oil through cheesecloth into jar to strain again.",
