    "des": "\"Move over, plain jane cucumber salad! This salad makes an entrance with unusual chunks of blue cheese tossed in for a creamy burst of flavor. If blue cheese is too strong for you, try a mild feta and a squirt of lemon! When testing this recipe, both light and regular sour cream held up well, while the fat free version tended to water out quickly.\"",
    "ins": "With a spoon, scoop out the seeds from the cucumber halves. Slice the cucumbers into thick half moons, and place the slices on a plate on paper towels. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of salt over the cucumber slices, and set aside.\nPlace the onion, sour cream, white wine vinegar, dill, sugar, and white pepper in a bowl, and mix until well combined. Lightly stir in the blue cheese. Pat the cucumber slices dry with paper towels, and lightly mix them into the salad. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving; season to taste with salt just before serving.",
