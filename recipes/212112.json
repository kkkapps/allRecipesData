    "des": "\"This is a wonderful, quick soup that works as a main dish with a compliment of cornbread, or as a great accent dish with your Mexican favorites!  Even my kids gobble this one down! Garnish with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and freshly chopped cilantro. This soup holds well in a slow cooker set on Low!\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook until the flour has turned golden brown, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Whisk in the pumpkin puree until no lumps remain, then add the chipotle peppers, half-and-half cream, sofrito, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and paprika. Return to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 8 minutes until thickened and hot.",
