    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nPlace the sausages and bacon into a large skillet over medium heat, and cook until the sausages are browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Slice the sausages into large chunks, and set the sausage and bacon aside.\nPlace a layer of 1/3 of the onions in a 9x13-inch baking dish, followed by a layer of 1/3 of the carrots and sliced potatoes. Arrange 1/3 of sausage and bacon in a layer over the potatoes; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and parsley. Repeat layers twice more. Warm the beef stock in a saucepan over medium heat, and pour in the stout beer and cream. Pour the sauce over the casserole, and let the sauce fill in the spaces in the layers.\nBake in the preheated oven until the potatoes and vegetables are tender, about 1 1/2 hours.",
