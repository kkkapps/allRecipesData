    "des": "\"These are a twist between a cinnamon roll and carrot cake cupcakes. You'll just have to roll your eyes and say 'Mmmmm' when you take your first bite! Another topping idea would be to sprinkle the muffins with a cinnamon-sugar mixture before baking. Top with a vanilla glaze.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.\nBeat milk, eggs, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in another bowl. Stir carrots into flour mixture; fold in milk mixture and butter until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
