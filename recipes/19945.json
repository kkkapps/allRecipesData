    "ins": "Simmer the tongue in water to cover until no longer pink, about 50 minutes per pound of tongue.  Remove from water and let rest until cool enough to handle.  Peel the skin off the tongue, trim the gristle, and cut into bite-size pieces.\nWhile the tongue is cooling, combine tomatoes, onion and cilantro in a medium bowl.  Mix well and set aside.\nIn large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Cook tongue with salt and pepper until heated through and slightly colored, 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain.\nIn a small skillet, heat tortillas 1 minute on each side.  To assemble tacos, layer tongue and tomato mixture inside a folded tortilla and sprinkle with lemon juice.  Serve immediately.",
