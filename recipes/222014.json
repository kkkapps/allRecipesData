    "des": "\"I made this recipe up one night when I had no idea what to do with a pound and a half of chicken tenderloins. It came out so well that my husband and I finished off the leftovers the next day and we are not usually leftover eaters. I am gluten-free so I used gluten-free cornbread mix. You will definitely enjoy it!\"",

Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.\nMix tomato sauce, water, taco seasoning mix, and chili powder together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat.\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat and brown chicken tenderloins on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Pour tomato sauce mixture over the chicken, bring to a simmer, and cook over medium-low heat until chicken tenderloins are no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to a bowl and shred; return shredded chicken to the sauce. Mix in black beans and cream cheese until thoroughly combined.\nPour chicken mixture into prepared baking dish. Top with shredded Mexican cheese. Whisk corn bread mix, egg, and milk in a bowl, and spoon the batter over the chicken mix.\nBake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the corn bread topping is browned and set, about 30 minutes.",
