    "des": "\"Make sure the frozen pearl onions go straight from the freezer into the roasting pan. Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position - closest to the heating element. And don't forget that sprinkling of sugar to help the browning.\"",
    "ins": "Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 425 degrees.\nToss onions with oil, sugar, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Transfer to a  cookie sheet with rim in a single layer. Roast onions until golden brown, about 30 minutes, stirring at 20 minutes and again at 25 minutes, adding garlic at this point.\nMeanwhile, bring vinegar to boil; simmer over medium-high heat, about 10 minutes, until reduced to 1/3 cup - it should be a thin syrup. Put onions into a bowl, add reduced vinegar and parsley; toss to coat. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.",
