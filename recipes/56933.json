    "ins": "In a medium bowl, crumble the tofu and toss with the chili powder and garlic.\nHeat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and saute the onion and celery until tender. Stir in the tofu mixture. Continue cooking about 5 minutes over low heat.\nMix in the corn, kidney beans, and stewed tomatoes. Add water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer about 50 minutes.",
