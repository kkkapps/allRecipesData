    "des": "\"This dip takes the tastes and flavors of a cannoli and turns it into a wonderful party snack! To serve, break up pizzelle cookies or waffle cones into chip-size pieces to scoop cannoli dip and enjoy! The dip tastes just like the filling from a cannoli, and the pizzelles act as the shell.\"",

Fold chocolate chips through the cheese mixture.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 10 minutes.",
