    "des": "\"I was making dinner for my mom one day and I decided to whip up a dessert to accompany it.  I didn't know what to do, so I just remembered the roasted cashew flour I had in the freezer and everything sort of clicked together. This cake is simple, yummy, healthy, and moist--everything you could want in a modest cake. You don't have to make roasted cashews if you're really short on time, but it does add a unique and subtle flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSpread cashews on a baking sheet. Sprinkle coarse salt on top; drizzle with honey.\nRoast in the preheated oven until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool briefly, about 5 minutes.\nGrind cashews into a meal in a nut grinder or blender. Sift meal through a fine sieve. Repeat grinding process until meal has a fine, flour-like consistency.\nMix oat milk, coconut oil, and eggs together in a bowl.\nCombine 3/4 cup cashew flour, brown rice flour, arrowroot powder, baking powder, guar gum, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, chili powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center; pour in oat milk mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until batter is well blended.\nGrease an 8-inch round cake pan with coconut oil. Pour batter into the pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 32 minutes.",
