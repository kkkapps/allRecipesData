    "des": "\"Arugula was on sale and I wanted to find new ways to use it. This became a quick favorite. I've found that there's no need to preheat the oven; a little longer cooking time produces a juicy thigh with crispy skin.\"",
    "ins": "Stuff spinach leaves, arugula, and garlic under the skin of the chicken thigh and place on a baking dish. Sprinkle with seasoned salt.\nBake chicken thigh in the oven set at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
