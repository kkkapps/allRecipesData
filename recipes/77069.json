    "ins": "Pour broth into a soup pot, or large saucepan, and bring to a simmer. Add the chile peppers, chicken, garbanzo beans, oregano, chipotle peppers, rice, salt and pepper. Return to a simmer, and cook for 30 minutes. If the soup is too thick, you can add a little more broth. Ladle into serving bowls, and top with sliced avocado and cheese cubes.",
