    "des": "\"Chicken pieces are seared and then simmered in a tomatillo sauce. This is my mother in law's recipe from the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. Serve with warm tortillas and your choice of rice or beans as side. We recommend a cold cola pop to accompany your delicious meal.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the tomatillos, California chilies, and red chile peppers into a small roasting pan or a rimmed baking sheet. Roast for about 20 minutes, turning frequently. If the chilies start to get too dark, remove them and place into a food processor or blender.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces and cook, turning to sear evenly on all sides.\nCombine the tomatillos and chilies in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt to taste. Pour this mixture in with the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until chicken is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.",
