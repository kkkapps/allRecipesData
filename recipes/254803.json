Lightly grease a loaf pan.\nSplit banana peels with a sharp knife and transfer flesh to a large bowl. Add honey and oil; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until combined.

Pour into the prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Invert onto a plate and let cool.",
