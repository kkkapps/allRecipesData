    "des": "\"Brandy and Benedictine come together deliciously in this simple but complex cocktail. It's just equal parts of each, but there's a trick to layering the ingredients into the brandy snifter. You don't need to serve it in a snifter, of course, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs a great way to enjoy the cocktail's complex aromas. The B and B is a favorite at the R Bar in New Orleans.\"",
    "ins": "Pour Benedictine(R) into a snifter or wine glass. Slowly pour brandy over the back of a bar spoon into the glass so that the brandy 'floats' atop the Benedictine(R).",
