    "ins": "Butter a 9x13 inch dish.\nIn a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, 1 cup cream and butter.  Bring to a boil, stirring often, then stir in remaining 1 cup cream.  Heat, without stirring, to 242 degrees F (116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball.  Remove from heat, stir in vanilla, and pour into prepared dish.  Refrigerate.\nWhen cool, return candies to room temperature then cut into 1 inch squares and wrap in waxed paper.",
