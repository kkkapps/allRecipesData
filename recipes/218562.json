    "ins": "Stir the cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, and shredded chicken meat together in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until it begins to simmer. Cut each biscuit into quarters, and gently stir into the simmering soup. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the biscuits are no longer doughy in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.",
