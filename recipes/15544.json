    "des": "\"Stuffed French toast with a creamy filling is good paired with a fibrous fruit such as a 1/2 cup fresh raspberries. Note: This French toast is high in sodium, primarily because of the cheeses. For a lower-sodium dish, substitute no-salt cheeses if you can find them. You can also try substituting orange, almond or strawberry extract for the vanilla. This recipe is from The WEBB Cooks, articles and recipes by Robin Webb, courtesy of the American Diabetes Association.\"",

Spread the mixture evenly into each bread pocket.\nBeat together the egg substitutes and milk. Dip the slices of bread in the egg mixture.\nHeat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Coat with cooking spray. Cook the toast on each side for about 3 to 4 minutes per side until golden brown.",
