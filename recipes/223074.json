    "des": "\"I'm a huge fish fan and I'm always looking for new ways to make fish. I couldn't find any recipe that sounded tasty on the net for arctic char so I decided to try my cooking talent and come up with my own recipe. My husband and I couldn't believe how delicious this turned out, all of the flavors balanced perfectly. He wasn't hungry that night and ended up eating majority of the fish, haha! This recipe will not disappoint.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil.\nSeason arctic char with salt, place in prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with lime zest.\nCombine lime juice, olive oil, sherry, rosemary, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until garlic is finely chopped. Spread mixture over fish and season with black pepper and cayenne pepper.\nBake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes, basting with pan juices about halfway through. When the fish is close to being cooked, switch the oven to broil for remaining two minutes or until browned.",
