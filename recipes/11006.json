After unwrapping all of the peppermint patties, place them on top of the wafers.\nUnwrap the fruit roll-ups (optional) and cut into squares.  Place on top of the all of the patties to look like cheese. Then place the sliced gumdrops on the top of that. Add the coconut.\nPlace the other half of the wafers over the top of the coconut.  With a small kitchen brush lightly paint a VERY small amount of water on the tops of the cookies. Finally shake or sprinkle a small amount of sesame seeds over the wafers.",
