    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nCombine the chicken and cheese in a bowl; stir in the hot pepper sauce. Warm the tortillas one at a time in a skillet over medium heat until flexible about 10 seconds per side.\nSpread about 1 heaping tablespoon of the chicken over half of the warmed tortilla. Roll tightly to form the taquito starting at the filled side of the tortilla. Place seamed side down in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven.",
