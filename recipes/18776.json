    "des": "\"I learned to make this spicy red chile dish by experimenting in my kitchen after enjoying it at a friend's place. It takes a while to make, but it is well worth it. Serve hot with tortillas, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa and sour cream. This also works well with a pork roast.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine the chili powder, cornstarch, lemon juice and water. Mix together well. Place the meat in a resealable plastic bag with the marinade and turn to coat thoroughly. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 16 hours.\nPlace in a slow cooker and cook on high setting for about 4 hours, or until the meat is completely cooked and shreds easily.",
