    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace sunflower seeds in a bowl and pour in enough water to cover; soak for about 10 minutes.\nMix 1 1/2 cans coconut milk, 1/4 cup curry paste, 1/4 cup cilantro, juice of 1 lime, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium-low heat until curry sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and mix pasta into curry sauce; cook and stir over low heat.\nPlace a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, about 2 minutes. Season broccoli with salt and curry powder and transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nDrain sunflower seeds and place in a blender with remaining coconut cream, remaining curry paste, remaining cilantro, juice of 1 lime, nutritional yeast, and sugar; blend until thick and smooth.\nSpoon pasta mixture over broccoli. Pour sunflower seed mixture over pasta and stir to coat evenly.\nBake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, about 10 minutes.",
