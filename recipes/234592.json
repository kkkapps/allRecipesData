Rinse with cold water until no longer hot; drain.\nSpoon chicken mixture into cooked pasta shells and arrange into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend over the stuffed shells; season with salt and pepper.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese is slightly melted and the stuffing is hot in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.",
