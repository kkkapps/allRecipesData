    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.\nBeat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the oats and raisins; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
