    "des": "\"This is a perfect gluten-free and not-too-sweet honey biscuit for strawberry shortcake or even sausage gravy as a breakfast treat. Thinking about how to thicken gravy? We use brown rice flour, works quite well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nWhisk gluten-free flour, coconut flour, baking powder, baking soda, sea salt, and xanthan gum together in a bowl. Stir butter, yogurt, honey, and egg together in a separate large bowl. Add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until dough is just combined.\nTurn dough out onto prepared baking sheet and shape into a large round about 3/4-inch thick. Use a knife to score dough into 8 triangles without cutting all the way through the dough.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 17 minutes. Cut on the scored lines through the dough to separate into individual scones.",
