Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender or fork until it resembles coarse crumbs.\nCombine apple and dried cranberries together in a bowl; mix into flour mixture.\nBeat half-and-half and egg together in a bowl until frothy; slowly stir into flour mixture using a rubber spatula until dough forms. Knead dough 4 to 5 times. Roll dough into a rectangle onto a lightly floured work surface using your hands. Cut rectangle in half diagonally and each half into 4 triangles, making 8 triangles. Arrange triangles on the prepared baking sheet.\nWhisk egg white and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl; brush over each triangle.\nBake in the preheated oven until scones are golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
