    "ins": "Melt cheese and 8 ounces butter or margarine in a double boiler.  Cool and stir in crabmeat. Stir until spreadable.  (Butter and cheese will separate, but will blend after stirring).\nCut crusts off of the bread slices and roll each piece of bread flat with rolling pin.  Spread crab mixture onto each flattened bread slice. Roll the bread up around the crab spread.\nIn a medium size sauce pan, melt the remaining 8 ounces butter or margarine.  Dip rolls in it and then roll in sesame seeds.  Place seam sides down in a shallow baking dish or cookie sheet and freeze.  After rolls are frozen, cover with foil.\nWhen ready to serve, partially thaw the roll ups, and cut each roll into fourths. Broil the roll ups until browned, about 3 to 5 minutes.",
