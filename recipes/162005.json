    "des": "\"This version of vodka sauce has been passed down through a lot of generations. Everyone adds their own special twist. So, if you like, try adding your own.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the tomato paste into the onion mixture, working all of the lumps out. Pour in the vodka and bring to a boil over medium-high heat; boil for 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato puree. Season with oregano, pepper, salt, thyme, parsley, and rosemary.\nReturn to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water if the sauce becomes too thick as it cooks, but remember that you'll be adding the cream soon, so don't thin it too much. Once the sauce has cooked, stir in the cream until the consistency and color are to your liking. Cook another 5 to 10 minutes to reheat.",
