    "des": "\"These turkey teriyaki meatballs from Natasha Kravchuk of Natasha's Kitchen are juicy and so flavorful with a homemade teriyaki glaze. They come together quickly making them an easy dinner idea for a busy weeknight. Try them over a bed of steamy rice or with toothpicks as an appetizer. Baking the teriyaki meatballs at a higher temperature sears in the natural juices and produces wonderfully soft meatballs that are healthier than when fried. You can easily double this recipe to feed a crowd.\"",
    "ins": "Line a 17x12-inch rimmed baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nCombine turkey, bread crumbs, green onion, egg, ginger, garlic and sesame oil in a large bowl. Use your hands or a spoon to mix just until well combined.\nRoll into 1 1/4\" to 1 1/2\" meatballs and bake at 400 degrees F for 10 to 12 minutes or until tender and juices run clear or a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees F.\nMeanwhile simmer the sauce ingredients together in a small saucepan 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently until slightly thickened.\nTransfer warm meatballs to a mixing bowl, drizzle with warm sauce and toss to combine.",
