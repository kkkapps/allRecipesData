    "des": "\"This recipe using only three chicken breasts is very economical and super delicious! My kids love it and they are extremely picky. The chicken just melts in your mouth and is so flavorful! Garlic bread and salad goes well with this meal.  I always taste before serving so I will know what, if anything more, I need to add such as Parmesan, Italian dressing, or milk if it's too thick, etc.\"",
