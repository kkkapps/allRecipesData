    "des": "\"It's true that chili mac is already a Mexican-inspired dish, but this version gets even closer to its roots with authentic Mexican ingredients including chorizo and poblano peppers. It's also quick (as long as you've got the pepper-roasting down) and easy--a true one-pot meal. Serve in bowls, and garnish with small dollops of sour cream or a sprinkling of queso anejo.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to broil. Place peppers on a baking sheet and place in oven. Allow skin to blacken and blister, turning the chile peppers until all sides are done. (Note: Do not overcook.) When they are done, place them in a paper bag and seal. Set aside for about 15 minutes. take them out of the bag and peel the skin off each one under running water. Remove the stems and seeds, then chop.\nMeanwhile, heat corn oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Squeeze chorizo out of casings into the hot oil. With a wooden spoon, break up the sausage, and cook about 4 minutes. Remove sausage, and set aside. Stir onion into oil, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.\nRemove charred skin from roasted peppers and rinse under cool water. Remove the stems and discard the seeds, if desired; coarsely chop.\nStir garlic into pan and cook for 1 minute. Stir in poblano peppers, and heat through 1 minute.\nIncrease the heat to high, and stir in tomatoes with liquid, black beans, cooked chorizo, water, macaroni, salt, pepper, and oregano. Bring to a low boil. Reduce heat to low; cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is al dente, about 15 minutes. Serve in bowls garnished with sour cream or queso anejo.",
