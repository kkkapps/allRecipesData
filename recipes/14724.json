    "ins": "Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chops two at a time, and shake to coat.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook chops until brown on both sides. Remove chops from skillet, and reduce heat to medium.\nBlend soup and milk in the skillet, stirring to scrape up the bits of breading left over from the chops. You can adjust the amount of milk depending on how thick you want the gravy to be (it will thin a bit during the cooking process). Bring to a gentle boil, increasing heat slightly if necessary. When soup mixture is bubbling, return chops to skillet. Cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until chops are cooked through.",
