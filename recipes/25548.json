    "ins": "Sift bread flour into a medium bowl and make a well in the center. Place egg and cold water in well. Beat with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough has formed. Use more water as necessary. Knead until elastic and pliable. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator 4 hours, or overnight.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into an approximately 14x14 inch square. Cut into 12 equal squares. Roll each square into a very thin 6x6 inch square. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.",
