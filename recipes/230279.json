    "des": "\"These scrumptious coconut macaroons are very simple to make and only use four ingredients. They are golden and just a little crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside. Almond extract really brings out the flavor of the coconut. So divine and so easy! I often double this recipe around holiday time because I can't seem to make them fast enough for my coconut lovers!\"",

Grease a large baking sheet.\nLoosely mold batter into 2-inch balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cookies are evenly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a sheet of waxed paper to cool completely.",
