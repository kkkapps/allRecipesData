    "des": "\"I love this recipe because it can be prepared ahead and frozen. Thaw time is minimal. A great dish for game day or surprise company. I really love this dish because it is so simple to make, yet it tastes fabulous. It freezes well, so when you have time on your hands, you can make a couple up and freeze them. Then when you are harried or just plain tired, just pop it in the oven and have a wonderful meal. It is also well within anyone's budget. Some like it better the second time around. Any kind of salad goes well with it.\"",
