    "des": "\"These are the best muffins I have ever made.  They are not low-fat but I don't worry. (I can watch other stuff - these are too good)  I make them in the jumbo muffin pans but they will work in the normal size - just adjust the baking time.\"",
    "ins": "Beat together the eggs, 2 1/2 cups white sugar and vegetable oil.  Add in milk, salt, baking powder, poppy seeds, vanilla, almond flavoring, and flour.  Mix well.\nBake in paper lined muffin cups (filled 3/4 full or 3 small greased loaf pans) at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)  for 15-20 minutes for muffins and 50-60 minutes for loaves.  The tops should be browned and a toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean.\nRemove muffins as soon as you can while still warm/hot and dunk tops into glaze.  Turn right side up and cool on a cookie rack.  With loaves just pour the glaze evenly over the three loaves while still in pans.  Let cool to a warm temp. and remove from pans.  Yes, it is a little messy but it is really good.\nTo Make Glaze:  In a saucepan over low heat, combine 3/4 cup sugar, orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring and 2 teaspoons melted butter.  Warm in pan until the sugar is dissolved.   Pour over loaf pans or dunk muffin tops into glaze when cooled to room temperature. (Omit the glaze altogether if you don't like the mess.)",
