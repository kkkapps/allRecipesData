    "des": "\"A full-bodied guacamole that I like to put on grilled hamburgers or chicken breasts.  Also good with chips.  The wasabi powder adds a great twist to guacamole.  You can substitute prepared horseradish for the wasabi.\"",
    "ins": "Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer, and fill with water to cover the eggs by at least 1 inch. Cover the saucepan, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel and dice the eggs.\nUse a fork to mash the avocados in a large bowl. Stir in the hard cooked eggs, onion, tomato, lime juice, pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and wasabi powder. Mix well; taste, and add additional salt and pepper if necessary.\nPlace guacamole in serving bowl, and garnish with green onion and cilantro. Cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour to allow flavors to blend.",
