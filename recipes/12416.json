    "des": "\"This recipe has a wonderful combination of a chocolate and peanut butter. It's simple and inexpensive. I make this pie for a restaurant owned by my mother, and we receive many compliments and even requests to purchase whole pies.  You can also use chocolate pudding; the pie tastes like peanut butter cup candy. For a really spectacular presentation, garnish with whipped cream, peanuts, and chopped peanut butter cups.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the chocolate with the whipping cream.  Stir until smooth, and spread evenly over the bottom of the pie shell.  Refrigerate until ready to fill; chocolate should be firm before filling.\nPut the dry pudding mix and peanut butter in a heavy saucepan.  Over low heat, gradually stir in the milk using a wire whisk.  Stir constantly until mixture thickens and comes to a boil.  Cool for 15 minutes, stirring often.  Pour peanut butter filling into crust.  Chill several hours.\nTop with whipped topping and chopped peanuts if desired.",
