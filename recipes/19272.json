    "des": "\"This cookie is like a fudge-filled shortbread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter or fork until only small lumps remain. Sprinkle the water and 1 teaspoon vanilla over the mixture and mix well using a fork. Set aside.\nIn a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup butter, egg yolk and sugar until smooth. Beat in 1 teaspoon vanilla, cocoa  and coconut until smooth. Set aside.  Use 1/2 of the dough at a time. On a cloth covered board, dusted generously with sugar, roll dough out to 1/16 inch thick. Cut the dough into 2 1/2 inch squares.  Spread 1 teaspoon of filling onto each square, bring the corners to the center and press lightly to seal. Place them onto an ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart.\nBake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until edges are golden. Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
