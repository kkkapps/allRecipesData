    "des": "\"I found this recipe in the newspaper 25 years ago, and modified it to suit my family's tastes. I make it every year when the ripe tomatoes and fruit come in. My family loves it with both roast beef and as a condiment with tamales. You can vary the amount and types of fruit. I have sometimes added chopped plums.\"",
    "ins": "Place the tomatoes, apples, peaches, pears, onion, and celery into a heavy pot. Stir in the pickling spices, brown sugar, pickling salt, and vinegar. Bring to a boil, while continuing to stir. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until thick, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, or about 45 minutes.\nPour the fruit relish into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space. Adjust caps. Process for 15 minutes in a boiling-water bath. Cool jars, and store in a cool, dry place.",
