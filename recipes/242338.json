    "des": "\"My mother passed me this recipe. It is a rice pudding recipe that is special because it reminds me of childhood.  \n\nRosewater is wonderful in many desserts, especially in this recipe for rice pudding. This recipe is special to me because of the rosewater. It adds a flavor that takes you to another part of the world where you imagine yourself walking through a souk. \n\nServe chilled.\"",
    "ins": "Bring milk and sugar to a boil in a saucepan; add rice and stir until mixture comes to a boil again. Reduce heat to low and cook until mixture becomes very creamy, about 45 minutes. Add more milk if mixture becomes too thick.\nPour rose water into mixture and stir until bubbles appear on the surface. Remove saucepan from heat and cool slightly. Pour rice pudding into a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. Serve pudding cold with almonds sprinkled on top.",
