    "des": "\"This no-drain, fast, and yummy recipe for potato leek soup is creamy and resembles baked potato soup in its texture and cheesy goodness, but sneaks in some leeks. Serve hot, topped with green onion, bacon bits, and/or shredded Cheddar to your liking. Using the butter or yellow potatoes makes a difference in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion and leeks until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPlace potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 inch; add onion and leeks. Bring water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat and mash potato mixture in the water, leaving some potatoes in chunks.\nStir cheese food into potato mixture until smooth; add potato flakes. Stir mixture until soup reaches desired consistency; season with salt and white pepper.",
