    "des": "\"This very simple casserole is made with sausage, cream cheese, and crescent roll dough. If you have hectic mornings, you can bake it at night and just cut and reheat portions the next morning in the microwave.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9x11 inch baking dish.\nCook the sausage in a skillet over medium heat until crumbly and beginning to brown; drain. Stir the cream cheese into the cooked sausage.\nRoll the dough from one can of crescent rolls into the bottom of the prepared baking dish without separating. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Spread the sausage mixture over the baked crescent rolls; top the sausage mixture with the remaining can of rolls. Return to oven and bake until the top layer is golden brown, about 8 minutes.",
