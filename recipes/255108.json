    "des": "\"Ever heard of baked taro fries? To all the AIP-eaters, nightshade-intolerants, and healthy fries-lovers, this recipe is a total game changer!\n\n Yams are great to replace normal potatoes, but when you get tired of that sweet taste and want something a bit more starchy, taro is a great, more exotic alternative. Taro is a delicious root vegetable I learned to love while I was living in Macau. One of my favorite things to do when I was there was to go to the Chinese supermarket and try to understand what all those weird fruits and vegetables were (yes, the labels were only in Chinese!).\n\n Serve as a delicious snack or a salad accompaniment.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nMix coconut milk, coconut oil, and salt together in a bowl. Add taro root and toss until coated.\nPlace coated taro root onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle with coconut flakes; mix well with your hands.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; flip and continue baking until coconut is golden and crispy, about 15 minutes.",
