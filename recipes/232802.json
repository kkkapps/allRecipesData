    "des": "\"A simple Italian recipe for pork chops (costolette) that are dipped in milk, coated with bread crumbs, and herbs and then baked in the oven for an easy mid-week dinner. I think the perfect sides are baked potatoes or even a simple salad.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour olive oil into a baking dish.\nPound pork chops with a meat tenderizer on a firm surface until thin and tender.\nPour milk into a shallow bowl. Combine bread crumbs, thyme, and rosemary in a second shallow bowl. Dip pork chops into the milk, then thoroughly coat with bread crumbs, and place in one layer in the prepared baking dish. Season with salt.\nBake in the preheated oven until bread crumbs are crispy, about 10 minutes per side.",
