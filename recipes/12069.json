Add heavy cream, salt, nutmeg, and ground black pepper, and stir until sauce thickens.  Reduce heat to low.  Add grated Parmesan cheese, and stir until the cheese melts. Set Alfredo sauce aside.\nIn a large bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, egg, oregano, marjoram, and basil.  Mix in cooked chicken.\nStuff cooked manicotti shells with chicken and ricotta mixture. Cover the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with half of the Alfredo sauce. Place stuffed shells on top of sauce. Pour remaining sauce over shells. Top with one cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake at 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 45 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.",
