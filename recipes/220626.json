    "des": "\"This is a really basic, simple, and easy-to-make traditional potato salad from Holland. Great recipe to finish up corned beef and potato leftovers! It's hearty and savory with a zesty sweet tang to it. Normally served for parties but can be served as a side dish for lunch or appetizer. Serve with fresh white or brown bread rolls.\"",
    "ins": "Combine 3/4 cup mayonnaise, ketchup, warm water, and vinegar in a large bowl and mix well. Stir in chopped gherkins, cocktail onions, diced apple, and shredded carrot. Add corned beef, mashed potatoes, and salt and pepper to taste; mix well.\nForm the potato salad on a plate as a loaf or a round mound. Garnish with slices of cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes, and slices of egg. Decorate with swirls or wavy lines of mayonnaise to add a little flair (see Cook's Note). Chill for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.",
