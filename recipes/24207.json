    "des": "\"This is an excellent recipe where no butter, oil or any type of fat is added.  It is not to dry and not too moist. The best thing about them is you can snack on them anytime you wish and how many as you like and not be worried. They also taste EXCELLENT! The glaze is a must.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.\nIn a large bowl, stir together flour, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Stir in milk, banana, apples, orange zest and vanilla extract. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Check bake time by inserting a toothpick into the center of a muffin. The muffins are done when the toothpick comes out clean.\nWhile muffins bake, combine 1/4 cup white sugar and 3 tablespoons water in a small saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Brush glaze over baked muffins, then sprinkle muffins with as much cinnamon as you like.",
