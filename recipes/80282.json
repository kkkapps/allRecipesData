    "des": "\"This yummy version of the original BLT dip uses canned tomatoes and paprika for a little more flavor!  Also, the low-fat versions of mayo and sour cream could work, but don't try to use the low fat turkey bacon.\"",
    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat until very crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.  Crumble, and reserve.\nMix the mayonnaise, sour cream, paprika in a large mixing bowl.  Stir in the bacon and the drained tomatoes. Chill dip at least 6 hours or overnight.",
