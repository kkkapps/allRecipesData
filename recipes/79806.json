    "des": "\"This is my most requested recipe. It goes well with any meat, especially ham or turkey.  My kids, though grown, still ask for this during family get togethers and holidays. It freezes well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large pot, combine the rice, both packets of soup mix and water. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 7 minutes.\nMeanwhile, crumble the sausage into a large skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as it begins to release its juices, add the onion, pepper and celery. Cook and stir until sausage is browned and vegetables are tender. Drain, and stir into the rice mixture. The mixture will appear soupy, but the rice will absorb the liquid while baking. Pour into a greased 2 quart casserole dish. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the aluminum foil, sprinkle sliced almonds on top, and continue cooking for 15 minutes to let the top of the rice brown.",
