    "ins": "Bring all syrup ingredients to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boil, stirring until sugar has dissolve, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Let stand, covered, 1 hour at room temperature.\nStrain through a fine-mesh sieve, pushing down on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate until ready to use.\nCombine gin, 1 cup of the rosemary-ginger simple syrup, sparkling water, and lime juice in a cocktail shaker. Add ice cubes and shake until well-chilled. Strain 3/4 cup each into 8 glasses and serve.",
