Shake off any excess flour, and place the chops in the skillet. Cook for a few minutes on each side, until browned.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the sour cream, milk, 1 tablespoon of flour, lemon juice, and honey. Season with a tiny bit of seasoning salt if desired. Pour the sauce over the chops, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until pork is cooked through.",
