    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line cookie sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a mixing bowl beat sugar, vanilla, lemon peel and  6 tablespoons of butter with an electric mixer until  well blended.    Add eggs one at a time,  beating well after each addition.   Continue to beat for 1 minute.\nStir in flour and baking powder (will be a soft, sticky dough).  Spoon dough into a pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch round tip.  Pipe 2-inch diameter rings onto the prepared cookie sheet.\nWith moistened fingertips, press ends of each ring  together to form a smooth ring.\nBake about 20 minutes or until golden brown.\nTo make icing:  Melt 1 tablespoon of butter over low heat.  Add sugar, water, lemon juice and vanilla  and whisk until sugar melts and mixture is heated through.   Thin with more water if icing is too thick to brush.\nRemove cookies from oven and immediately brush warm icing over hot cookies.  Cool iced cookies on sheet for 2 minutes.    Transfer to a rack and cool completely.",
