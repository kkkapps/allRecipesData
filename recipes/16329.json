    "des": "\"This isn't traditional Sauerbraten, but a great, easy substitute using round steak. My mom made this dish when I was a kid. I started making it when my kids were young, and we all love it!! Try serving over buttered noodles. If your crew is really hungry, then double the recipe. The single recipe is never enough for my family of four.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced meat and brown well. Remove meat. Add the gravy mix and water and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.\nStir in the onion powder, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, bay leaf and salt, and ground black pepper to taste. Return the meat to the pan, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for one hour, or until meat is tender. Remove bay leaf.\nNote: You could also transfer to a casserole dish and bake covered at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 1/2 hours.",
