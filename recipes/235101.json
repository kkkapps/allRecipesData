    "des": "\"Super-easy way to make a baked fruit dessert. It makes a nice autumn treat. This isn't a fruit crisp, nor a buckle, nor a cobbler nor a betty, hence the name. It comes closer to the German Kaiserschmarrn. You can use peaches, pears, nectarines, whole blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, or a combination of fruits (or frozen berries), plus raisins if you like them.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSet butter in the middle of an 8-inch baking pan.\nHeat butter in the pan in the preheated oven until butter melts, about 2 minutes.\nWhisk flour, sugar, walnuts, oats, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add milk and vanilla; stir well to create a batter.\nPour batter into baking pan over melted butter. Place sliced plums over batter into baking pan. Sprinkle top with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.\nBake in the preheated oven until batter browns, fruit bubbles, and a knife inserted into the batter comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool to room temperature.",
