Don't have to worry about cleaning their hands, might have to clean around their mouth though, if you have one of those children that could make a mess out of absolutely nothing. I was one of those children and still am today.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 42 miniature muffin tins with paper liners.\nMix graham cracker crumbs with butter in a bowl until evenly combined. Spoon graham cracker mixture into the prepared muffin cups, pressing into the bottom and up the sides creating a crust.\nPlace 1 chocolate square onto each crust and top each with 3 miniature marshmallows.\nBake in the preheated oven until marshmallows are puffy and chocolate is melted, about 6 minutes.",
