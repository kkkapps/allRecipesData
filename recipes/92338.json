Stir in the red wine, and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and keep warm.\nHeat the oil in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Fry steaks for 5 to 7 minutes per side, or to your desired degree of doneness. Remove to a plate and let rest for a few minutes. Top with mushrooms and serve.",
