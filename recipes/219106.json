    "des": "\"My mom lives in a small town in western New York, called Clifton Springs. Whenever I go home to visit, I usually indulge in some Buffalo chicken wings from a place called Emerson's. They have two flavors of wings; Buffalo-style, and sweet and sour. I came up with what turned out to be a deliciously sticky, ginger and garlic glaze. I really hope you give these a try.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil; grease the foil with cooking spray.\nPlace the chicken in a large mixing bowl. Season with salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Add the vegetable oil; toss to coat.\nPlace the flour and wings in a large, food-safe plastic bag. Hold the bag closed tightly, and shake to coat the wings entirely with the flour; no wet spots should remain. Arrange the wings on the prepared baking sheets, making sure none of the pieces are touching one another. Spray wings with additional cooking spray\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, turn all the wings, and return to the oven to cook until crispy and no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more.\nWhisk together the garlic, ginger, chili paste, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and soy sauce in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil and immediately remove from heat.\nPut about half the wings in a large mixing bowl. Pour about half the sauce over the wings. Toss the wings with tongs to coat evenly; transfer to a tray and allow to sit about 5 minutes to allow the sauce to soak into the wings before serving. Repeat with remaining wings and sauce.",
