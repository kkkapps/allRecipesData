    "des": "\"An old-time noodle custard dessert recipe with a bit of a modern twist. Layered egg noodles with apples, pears and dried cranberries baked in sweet custard. It has a warm grandmotherly taste and feeling to it. Simple yet rich in flavor with little effort in preparation sure to please many in the autumn. It takes advantage of apples and pears harvested in the fall along with tangy sweet dried cranberries.\"",
