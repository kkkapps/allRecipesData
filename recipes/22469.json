    "des": "\"This recipe is easier than it sounds.  I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a quick dinner the next night.  FYI: the sauce is much better after it is cooked.  It is not a dipping sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut spareribs into serving size portions, wrap in double thickness of foil, and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Unwrap, and drain drippings. (I usually freeze the drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.\nIn a bowl, mix together brown sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, chile sauce, garlic, mustard, and pepper. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, or refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat grill for medium heat. Position grate four inches above heat source.\nBrush grill grate with oil. Place ribs on grill, and cook for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.",
