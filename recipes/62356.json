    "des": "\"An old family recipe for quince jelly. Quince is a fruit related to apples and pears. It is quite tart, and cannot be eaten raw. This jelly is the perfect way to make use of the quince fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Sterilize 8 (1/2 pint) jars in boiling water for at least 5 minutes, and have new lids ready.\nPlace the quinces in a large pot, and pour in water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes. Strain off 4 cups of the juice. Mix juice with sugar and lemon juice in a heavy pot, and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Stir in pectin, and return to a boil. Boil for 1 full minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off foam. Ladle into hot sterile jars, and process for 10 minutes in a hot water bath to seal. Refrigerate jelly after opening.\nStore sealed jars in a cool dark place. Refrigerate jelly after opening.",
