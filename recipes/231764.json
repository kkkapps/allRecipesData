    "des": "\"A truly delicious pinto bean recipe from deep south Texas.\"",
    "ins": "Pick over beans and wash in cold water 4 times. Place beans into a large pot, pour in enough fresh water to cover by 2 inches, and soak overnight.\nBring beans and soaking water to a boil; stir in garlic and salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer beans until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 hours, stirring often. If beans start to dry out, add more boiling water.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tomatoes and onion in the hot oil until onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir cilantro, 5 to 6 large spoonfuls of beans, and cooking liquid into tomato mixture. Mash beans and stir tomato mixture back into simmering beans. Continue simmering until flavors are blended, about 1 hour more.",
