    "ins": "Heat butter and sugar together in a heavy saucepan over low heat until mixture turns light brown, about 5 minutes. Add nectarine quarters and cardamom pods; cook and stir over medium heat until nectarines are soft, about 18 minutes. Remove and discard cardamom.\nRemove saucepan from heat and allow nectarine mixture to cool slightly. Transfer mixture to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth; place in the refrigerator until completely cooled, about 30 minutes.\nBeat double cream in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream will form soft mounds. Spoon cream over chilled compote.",
