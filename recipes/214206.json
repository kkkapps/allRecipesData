    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nWrap each pork chop in  2 bacon slices to completely cover the pork chop, and secure with toothpicks. Place the wrapped chops onto a broiler pan, and broil until browned, about 5 minutes per side.\nMix together the chili sauce, brown sugar, and Dijon mustard in a bowl. Place the browned pork chops into the bottom of a slow cooker, and pour the chili sauce mixture over the chops. Spread pineapple chunks over the chops, set the cooker to Low, and cook until very tender, about 6 hours.",
