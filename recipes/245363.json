    "des": "\"A fruit salad has to be pretty darn good to actually get a name, and the venerable Waldorf salad is certainly worthy.\u00c2\u00a0Embellish this as you see fit, but I really like it best with just the four ingredients seen here. Things like dried cranberries can add a nice seasonal touch but, for me, the chewy fruit gets in the way of that addictive crunchy/crisp texture.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk mayonnaise, creme fraiche, lemon juice, tarragon, sugar, salt, black pepper, and cayenne together in a bowl.\nPlace apples, celery root, grapes, and walnut pieces in a large bowl. Toss with about 1/2 cup of dressing. Add more dressing until salad components are well coated but not swimming in dressing. You might not need all the dressing.\nServe immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.",
