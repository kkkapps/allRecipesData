Stir in broth, bay leaves, and soy sauce. Bring soup to a boil.\nWhisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; pour into soup and stir well to incorporate. Reduce heat and simmer soup until it starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add coconut milk, salt, and black pepper. Simmer just until coconut milk is heated through (do not allow to boil), about 5 minutes.",
