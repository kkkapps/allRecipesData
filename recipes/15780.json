    "des": "\"This recipe doesn't taste like you would imagine. It's a huge hit with everyone who has tried it. It has a great flavor, and it is wonderful when its warmed with butter on it. People are always asking me to make them a loaf or two. Note: For best slicing results and a tender crust, wrap bread in aluminum foil and slice the next day. If you can wait that long...we can't.\"",

Grease and flour two 9x5x3 inch loaf pans.\nPuree undrained pork and beans in a blender or food processor.\nIn a large bowl, combine eggs, flour, sugar, salt, oil, cinnamon, vanilla, baking soda and baking powder.
