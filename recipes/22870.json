    "des": "\"Tender beef chuck roast braised in a unique coffee-mushroom-sour cream sauce.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot, heat the butter and oil over medium/high heat. Place the roast in the pot and sear it on all sides until well browned. Remove the roast and set aside.\nIn the same pot, saute the onions for 5 minutes, scraping loose the brown roast bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the garlic and pepper and saute for 1 minute. Return the meat to the pot and pour in the coffee and add the mushrooms.\nOver high heat, bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 hours, turning the meat over halfway through the cooking time.  A slow cooker may be used for cooking the roast, if desired.\nTo make the gravy:  When the roast is done, remove it from the pot. Take 1/2 cup of the coffee sauce mixture from the pot and stir in the cornstarch to make a slurry. Mix well. Return the slurry to the pot, stirring until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in the sour cream then salt to taste.",
