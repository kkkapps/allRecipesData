    "des": "\"This is a yummy and EASY recipe that kids love! Similar to tuna casserole, but without the noodles. You may add different veggies or use cream of mushroom soup, my family doesn't care for mushrooms, so I use the chicken instead.  Can also use fat-free soup.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch square baking dish.\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the tuna, peas and cream of chicken soup. Gently fold in the cereal. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbling and lightly browned on top.",
