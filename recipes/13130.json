    "des": "\"A gorgeously creamy leek soup with a tangy cheese and mustard kick. Best served with cheese and onion bread or walnut bread.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over medium heat, saute the leeks, onion, potato and carrot in the butter or margarine and the olive oil for 10 minutes, or until all vegetables are tender.\nMix the mustard powder and cornstarch with the 1/2 cup water to make a thin paste. Set aside.\nSeason the vegetable mixture with salt and pepper and sugar. Stir in the mustard-water mixture and the 5 cups water. Bring mixture to a boil. Stir in the bouillon cube, reduce heat and simmer for about one hour, until reduced by half.\nUsing a hand blender or upright blender, puree mixture until frothy but not completely smooth.\nReturn this to the pot and bring to a boil. Stir in the heavy cream, Gruyere and Cheddar cheeses. Heat until cheeses melt, do not boil. Serve hot.",
