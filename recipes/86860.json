    "des": "\"A quick and easy, delicious way to serve pork! Can be served over a bed of chopped romaine for a low-carb meal, or noodles for the traditionalists. The oil you use will make all the difference: the peanuttier the better; an obscure brand from the ethnic section of the supermarket is usually a better bet than one of the cheaper, mass-market varieties.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes, soy sauce, broth, and peanut butter. Stir in pork to coat. Set aside.\nHeat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onions, and cook about 1 minute. Stir in cashews. Cook until unions are soft and translucent. Pour in pork and marinade. Cook until pork pieces are done, about 10 minutes. Stir in mixed vegetables, and cook 5 minutes more.",
