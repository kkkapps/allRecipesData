Pour batter into prepared baking dish.\nMix 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl using a fork to achieve a crumbly consistency; sprinkle over the top of the batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
