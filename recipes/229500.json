    "des": "\"This is a delicious pumpkin muffin that is very moist, with pumpkin seeds mixed into the batter. A great twist on pumpkin muffins. Pumpkin seeds are also very good sprinkled on top of the muffins before baking. I also add about two tablespoons of flax seed meal when making the recipe. If the batter seems too thick, more applesauce can be added to achieve the desired consistency.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 3 muffin pans.\nMix pumpkin, sugar, applesauce, oil, and eggs together in a bowl until well blended; fold in pumpkin seeds. Mix flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, salt, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until just combined; pour batter among prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.",
