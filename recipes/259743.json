    "des": "\"The spices in this soup really marry up well and make this the tasty, flavorful soup it is. I can guarantee you will impress even the fussiest of eaters. If you can use organic vegetables, the soup will have a glorious color and taste more intense. Most people cannot tell that you have used coconut milk instead of cream. This makes it not only taste good, but full of all the health benefits of the coconut. Add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt or some chopped parsley, or drizzle with good quality, cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy and taste the golden color of the sun!\"",
