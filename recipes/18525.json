    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a food processor, whirl flour, sugar and salt together until well mixed. Break up frozen grapeseed oil and combine with flour mixture. Whirl together until it looks like cornmeal. Gradually pour in water adding just enough to allow for dough to form a ball.\nImmediately press dough into pie pan. Cover and refrigerate any leftover dough. Wrap pie crust edges with foil and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Use with your favorite pie recipe.",
