    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the tart shells into muffin pans and set aside.\nCook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble once cool.\nBeat the eggs in a mixing bowl; whisk in the cream, flour, garlic salt, onion powder, chili powder, and cumin until smooth. Stir in the crumbled bacon, 2 cups Cheddar cheese, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, ham, and salsa. Ladle the mixture into the tart shells; sprinkle with 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.",
