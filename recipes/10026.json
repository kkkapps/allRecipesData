Add eggs and beat until fluffy.\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the flour,    baking powder, and salt. Dissolve the baking soda in the buttermilk and  add alternately to the margarine mixture with flour mixture.\nRoll out dough and sprinkle with nutmeg. Cut with a biscuit cutter.  Dough will be very soft and delicate.\nBake until lightly browned around the edges.  A really soft, chewy  cookie.",
