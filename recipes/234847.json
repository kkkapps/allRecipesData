    "des": "\"This is one of my favorite recipes and was given to me by a neighbor many years ago. I've been making it ever since when the weather is cool and it is cozy to have the oven on. It is a no fail, super-easy recipe and I guarantee it will please your family and friends. The recipe can also be made with a cut up chicken.\"",
    "ins": "Stir water, ketchup, onion, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, honey, flour, garlic powder, black pepper, and poultry seasoning together in an oven-safe Dutch oven. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend, 5 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace chicken in Dutch oven and turn to coat in ketchup mixture. Spoon 1/4 the mixture and onions into the chicken cavity. Place chicken breast side down into Dutch oven; cover with an oven-proof lid.\nBake chicken in the preheated oven, basting once, for 45 minutes. Uncover the Dutch oven and increase heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nTurn chicken breast side up and bake until chicken has browned, about 15 more minutes.
