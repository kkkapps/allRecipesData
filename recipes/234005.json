    "des": "\"Prepare yourself for a juicy flavor kiss! Brining is a popular method for improving the flavor and moisture content of lean meats like chicken, turkey, pork, and seafood. Enjoy the most juiciest and flavorful turkey you'll ever eat.\"",
    "ins": "Mix water, chicken broth, and salt together in a 5-gallon bucket with lid until salt dissolves. Add garlic, rosemary, onion, basil, savory, marjoram, thyme, tarragon, oregano, pepper, and coriander and mix well. Stir 2 cups ice into brine.\nPlace turkey into brine, filling cavity with brine. Add enough ice to bucket to cover turkey. Secure lid on bucket. Swish bucket from side-to-side to chill water. Refrigerate turkey and bucket, refilling with ice every 2 hours as needed, 12 to 24 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove turkey from brine and pat dry. Discard brine. Place turkey on a rack inside a roasting pan.\nBake turkey in the preheated oven, basting every 30 to 40 minutes, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 5 to 6 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.",
