    "ins": "Melt the butter in a flat-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Slice the hot dog length-wise about 3/4 of the way through; place onto the pan with the cut-side down along with the hot dog bun. Cook both until golden brown; flip and cook the other side until golden brown. Remove the bun from the pan and spread the strawberry jam over the inside of the bun; set aside. Meanwhile, top the hot dog with the slice of Swiss cheese. Place a lid over the hot dog and continue cooking until the cheese has melted, about 1 minute. Place the hot dog in the bun to serve.",
