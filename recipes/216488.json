    "des": "\"This recipe was a huge favorite at a local restaurant for many years.  Unfortunately, the family who owned the restaurant is no longer in town, but I enjoyed this so much I counted myself lucky to get a copy before they left!  Be sure to thaw the spinach out the night before for more even cooking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBrown turkey sausage and fennel seeds in a large skillet over medium heat, about 10 minutes; drain off excess grease, then add mushrooms and spinach. Cook until the mixture is hot and the juice from the spinach and mushrooms has evaporated,10 to 15 more minutes. Spread the turkey mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nIn a bowl, mix the butter, Parmesan cheese, half and half cream, Monterey Jack cheese, mustard powder, and vermouth until well combined; pour over the sausage mixture in the baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling and the topping has browned, 20 to 30 minutes. Check after 20 minutes.",
