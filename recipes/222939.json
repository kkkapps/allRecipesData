    "des": "\"The good old-fashioned country way. This is definitely NOT diet food. You don't drain the bacon fat off after you brown it. If you really have to, you can substitute butter, but it won't be the same. You can also use this recipe with a combination of yellow and pattypan squash.\"",
    "ins": "Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onions and cook in the bacon drippings until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add squash, salt, and black pepper; stir to coat.\nCover skillet and cook squash mixture over low heat until tender, about 25 minutes.",
