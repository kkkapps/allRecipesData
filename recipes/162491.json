    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe because I always enjoy pickles on the side with my basic grilled cheese sandwich. So one day I decided just to put my pickles on the sandwich in addition to some other favorite ingredients. I think it turned out really delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Butter one side of each slice of bread with 1 tablespoon of butter. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium  heat. Place one bread slice butter-side-down into the skillet, and top with the Cheddar cheese, pickle slices, and onion. Place the remaining slice of bread butter-side-up onto the sandwich. Cook until crispy and golden brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes.",
