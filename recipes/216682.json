    "ins": "Place the brats into the bottom of a large electric covered roaster (such as a Nesco(R)). Layer the apples, then the onions, then the brown sugar over the brats. Pour the water over the ingredients.\nCover the roaster and cook the brats at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 3 hours. Brats will look dark and candied when ready.",
