    "des": "\"These is an easy, cost-efficient way to make home-made fried cheese sticks. Taste just wonderful, light crispiness. More for your dollar and easily stored in the freezer for when you have a craving. I make 2 batches, one for the 'now' and one for later. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Remove string cheese sticks from plastic wrappings and cut the strings in half crosswise.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place eggs in a bowl and bread crumbs into a large shallow bowl.\nDip cheese stick halves into egg and roll in bread crumbs to completely coat the sticks; place breaded cheese sticks onto the prepared baking sheet. Allow cheese sticks to stand at room temperature for about 5 minutes to set, and repeat dipping in egg and bread crumbs to form a thick coating. Freeze breaded cheese sticks for at least 2 hours.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDeep fry cheese sticks, a few at a time, until the coating is golden brown and crisp and the cheese is soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Let sticks drain on paper towels; cool slightly and serve warm.",
