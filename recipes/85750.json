    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the chicken drumsticks in a 9x13 baking dish. Season with rosemary, salt and pepper. Pour the beers in with the chicken.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until the chicken is browned and meat slides off the bone easily. Just you wait! You are going to love it!",
