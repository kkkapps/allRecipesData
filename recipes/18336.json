Note: you can add as many vegetables as you like, but this dish can also be tossed in with pasta, if tossing with pasta, just add a lot more olive oil.\"",
    "ins": "Cut zucchini in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise into thin half-moons. Cut onion into large dice. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in olive oil, then saute onion until lightly browned. Stir in zucchini and continue to saute until zucchini is soft and lightly browned. Season with salt to taste.",
