    "ins": "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Heat another 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat.\nToss the pork loin with the flour in a bowl to coat the pork evenly.\nCook and stir the pork in the hot oil in the large pot until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Meanwhile, cook and stir the onions in the hot oil in the skillet until soft and brown, about 10 minutes.\nPour the chicken stock into the large pot with the pork loin; add the browned onions, butternut squash, garlic cloves, minced garlic, baby carrots, celery, black olives, and crimini mushrooms. Bring the chicken stock mixture to a boil and reduce heat to medium low. Stir the Cabernet Sauvignon wine, sage, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and basil into the mixture. Place a cover on the pot and allow the mixture to simmer until fragrant and the pork loin is very tender, 2 to 3 hours.",
