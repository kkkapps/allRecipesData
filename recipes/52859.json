    "des": "\"When my friend Dee gave me this recipe I was very skeptical.  Who ever heard of cheesecake made with crescent dough?  I made it one day when I had 3 back-up desserts and it was one of the first to go. So easy to make and a popular demand by my family, I make it all the time.  Hey!!  Even my no-impress mother-in-law asked for the recipe!!!  Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFlatten one tube of crescent roll dough, and press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese with 1 cup sugar and vanilla until smooth. Spread the cream cheese mixture over the dough in the pan. Unroll the remaining crescent roll dough, and place over the top of the cream cheese layer. Spread melted butter over the top, and sprinkle the top with a mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until top is lightly toasted. Cool, and refrigerate before serving.",
