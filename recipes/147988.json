    "des": "\"This is extremely moist and gets you fiber from not only fruits AND veggies, but bran AND whole wheat too! It is truly a guilt free comfort food, and because it is low fat, it is even yummier the day after. Feel free to cut down on the sugar or maple syrup by personal preference.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x13 inch baking pan.\nStir together the pumpkin, banana, egg, and egg whites in a large bowl. Beat in maple syrup, sugar, and vanilla; the batter should be a bit frothy. Stir in zucchini; set aside.\nMix flour, bran, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and allspice in a separate bowl. Gradually add the flour mixture to the zucchini mixture, stirring just to moisten all ingredients. Over-mixing the batter will make it tough.\nPour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into squares.",
