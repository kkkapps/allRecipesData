    "des": "\"You will need a springerle rolling pin (imprinted with different designs) for these cookies.\"",
    "ins": "Beat eggs until light and fluffy, gradually adding sugar ( approx. 15 minutes) This  is important, do not underbeat.\nFold in extract and flour.\nRoll dough out on lightly floured surface to about 3/8 inch.  Use rolling pin to firmly \"imprint\" the design onto dough.\nCut cookies apart and on greased baking sheet, sprinkle with anise seeds.  Let cookies sit out overnight, covered, to \"dry\".\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace cookies into oven and reduce temp to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).  Bake until light yellow only, approx. 15 minutes.  They are not supposed to get brown!\nThese cookies are a hard cookie, need to  be stored for at least 2-3 weeks.  You can  add a slice of apple to \"soften\" back up  or a slice of bread  works, too.  Replace bread or apple every 2-3 days.",
