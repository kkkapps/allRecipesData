    "des": "\"The stuffed eggplant is a classic from the Puglia region and throughout the south of Italy.\u00c2\u00a0When summer comes and I find small seedless eggplants, I prepare them very often. I add olives and capers to the filling; they blend very well with the flavor of eggplant. These taste even better if prepared in advance, even the day before.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nArrange eggplant halves cut-side up in a baking pan. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until tender, about 20 minutes. Cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nScoop pulp out of the eggplants using a spoon, leaving skins intact. Chop pulp coarsely and transfer to a bowl. Mix in eggs, Parmesan cheese, capers, and olives. Add 2 tablespoons tomato sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper. Stuff eggplant skins with mixture.\nSpread half of the remaining tomato sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange stuffed eggplants on top. Spoon remaining tomato sauce over each eggplant.\nBake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and tomato sauce is bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.",
