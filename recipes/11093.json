    "des": "\"These cookies are formed by cookie cutters.  By using a toothpick to make a hole in the top of the cookie, you can hang them on the tree.  You can also make paint out of egg yolks, and food coloring to make them more colorful--use as much food coloring as needed to create desired hue.  My girls and I would spend hours making these cookies each Christmas so we could hang them on the tree.\"",
    "ins": "Mix shortening, brown sugar, and molasses thoroughly.  Stir in 2/3 cup water.  Blend  flour, soda, salt, and spices; stir into molasses mixture.  Chill for about 1 hour.\nRoll the dough about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut with boy and girl cookie cutters.\nMake egg yolk paint by blending egg yolks and 1/2 teaspoon water.  Divide the yolk among a few small bowls, and add food coloring to each cup for desired color.  Paint the clothes and decorations on the cookies as desired.  Carefully transfer to a lightly greased baking sheet.   Using a toothpick, make a hole in the top of each cookie.  Press raisins into dough for eyes, nose, mouth.  Use bits of candied cherries for coat buttons, and strips of citron for ties.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool slightly, then carefully remove from baking sheet.",
