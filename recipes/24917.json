    "des": "\"This quick and easy dip has all the flavor of fried Rangoon -- without the time and mess of frying. Won ton wrappers are baked crisp, then dipped in a creamy Asian-style sauce. They disappear fast at gatherings! The won ton wrappers may need to be baked in several batches.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.\nIn a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, soy sauce, fresh ginger root, garlic, parsley and crabmeat.\nCut wonton wrappers diagonally into triangles. Arrange triangles on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle with paprika, increasing the amount as desired.\nBake wrappers in the preheated oven until crisp and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\nPour approximately 1/2 the duck sauce over cream cheese mixture. Serve the rest with the toasted won ton wrapper triangles for dipping.",
