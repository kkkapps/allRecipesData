    "des": "\"Low on ingredients? This is quick, easy, and surprisingly filling.\n This recipe capitalizes on the wonderful taste of avocado, so make sure yours is in season and ripe. The idea of this snack is that avocado will overwhelm the cheese, but the cheese will add an additional taste into the mix.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nPlace bread on a baking sheet; top each piece with 4 pieces Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Cover each bread slice with sliced avocado.",
