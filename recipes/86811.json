    "des": "\"I developed this recipe after tasting something similar at a local Cuban restaurant. This is a simple and savory stew - delicious over steamed white rice. The seasonings aren't strict measurements so add more of anything to suit your taste.\"",
    "ins": "Slice sausage lengthwise, then cut into 1/4-inch slices.\nHeat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Brown sausage about 5 minutes. Stir in onion; cook 5 minutes. Stir in chickpeas and juices, tomato sauce, and sherry. Season with oregano, red pepper flakes, black pepper, garlic powder, and adobo seasoning. Simmer, stirring occasionally, at least 10 minutes (1 hour or more is preferable).",
