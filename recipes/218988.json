    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Move a rack to the bottom of the oven.\nWhisk the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla together in a stainless steel bowl until smooth. Bring the cream just to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; pour into the egg yolk mixture, whisking continually until combined.\nBring a couple of inches of water to a simmer in an oven-safe saucepan over medium low heat; set the bowl with the cream mixture over the saucepan to form a double boiler.\nPlace the entire double boiler into the preheated oven; bake until the mixture sets, about 30 minutes.\nChill in refrigerator 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nCombine the brown sugar with 2 tablespoons of white sugar in a bowl; sprinkle evenly over the cold creme.\nHeat under the preheated broiler until the sugar melts and browns, 2 to 3 minutes; return immediately to the refrigerator and chill until the sugar is set, about 15 minutes.",
