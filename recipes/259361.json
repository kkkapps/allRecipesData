    "des": "\"These rainbow trout fillets are quick and easy to make. The blood orange zest mingles with the Parmesan to bring out the fish's mild flavors without overpowering it. Cooking it in butter brings a noticeable nutty flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Mix Parmesan cheese, onion powder, oregano leaves, and blood orange zest together in a shallow dish. Press trout fillets into the Parmesan mixture to coat. Shake off excess and place fillets on a plate.\nMelt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add fillets; cook until brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.",
