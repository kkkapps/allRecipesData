    "ins": "Rinse fennel.  Trim off stems, and reserve about 1 cup of the tender green leaves.  Trim any bruises or dry looking areas from fennel.  Cut each bulb in half from stem through root end.\nLay fennel bulb pieces in a 10 inch frying pan, and add broth.  Cover, and bring to a boil on high heat.  Simmer until fennel is tender when pierced, 20 to 25 minutes.  Transfer fennel to a shallow casserole, 9 to 10 inched wide; lay cut side up.\nBoil broth, uncovered, on high heat until reduced to about 1/2 cup.  Stir in about half the fennel leaves.  Spoon mixture evenly over fennel.\nMash cheese with bread crumbs.  Dot mixture evenly over fennel.  If making ahead, cover and chill up to 1 day.  Also wrap remaining fennel leaves in a towel, seal in a plastic bag, and chill.\nBake casserole, uncovered, at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until cheese begins to brown and fennel is hot, about 20 minutes.  Tuck remaining leaves around fennel.  Season to taste with salt.",
