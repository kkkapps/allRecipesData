Roast 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tender and skin starts to brown.\nWhile the peppers are roasting, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onions, basil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato, and cook for 5 minutes. Spoon in the cooked rice, and stir until heated through. Remove from heat, mix in the feta cheese, and spoon the mixture into the pepper halves.\nReturn to the oven for 5 minutes. Serve immediately.",
