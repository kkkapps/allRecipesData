Cover, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nRemove salmon from marinade, and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Cook on preheated grill until fish is opaque in the center and flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.",
