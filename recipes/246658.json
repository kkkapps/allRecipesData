    "des": "\"This recipe has been in my family for a long time. It works really great as a side dish or as a main dish if served with pasta (I like to use either gemelli or cavatelli). The chicken broth takes a lot of the bitterness out of the broccoli rabe. Top with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large pot with chicken broth and 1 cup water; add broccoli rabe. Bring to a boil and cook until nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook, stirring to break into small pieces, until crumbly and browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broccoli rabe, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until broccoli rabe is tender, about 3 minutes more.",
