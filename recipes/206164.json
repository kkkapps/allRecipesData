    "des": "\"This is a recipe from my hometown of Sarajevo, and it is similar to a southern cornbread. What makes it unique is the addition of semolina flour (or Cream of Wheat\u00c2\u00ae). If you don't have semolina flour, you can just replace it with additional corn meal. This recipes also makes excellent muffins.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter an 8x8-inch baking dish and sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornmeal over the bottom of the dish.\nSift the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, 1/4 cup cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk the eggs, buttermilk, and vegetable oil together in a separate large bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the egg mixture until just combined; don't overmix. The batter should be pourable; add more buttermilk as needed to get the right consistency.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.",
