    "des": "\"This salmon steak is grilled with a sweet, simple peach sauce. It can also be baked.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nStir together the peaches, honey, and curry powder in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the peaches break down, and the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSeason the salmon steaks with salt and pepper, and cook on the preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes per side depending on the thickness of the steaks. Pour the peach sauce over the salmon to serve.",
