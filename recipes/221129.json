    "des": "\"The problem with bottled sauces and marinades is that the only words you recognize on the ingredients list are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh fructose corn syrup,' and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdehydrated garlic.' Hopefully, you will see just how simple this sauce is to make. Not only is it MSG-free, but the flavor is far superior to any of those supermarket bottles.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nWhisk orange juice, brown sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, chile paste, fish sauce, and garlic in a large bowl. Add skirt steak and marinate for 15 minutes.\nCook steaks on the preheated grill until they are browned and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).",
