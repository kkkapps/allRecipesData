    "ins": "Steam the artichokes in 2 cups water until tender (about 45 minutes) and reserve the liquid afterwards. Allow the artichokes to cool.\nScrape the flesh from the bottom third of each leaf and place in medium soup pot along with the artichoke liquid.\nRemove fuzzy choke from each artichoke bottom and discard.\nCoarsely dice the artichoke bottoms and place in the soup pot. Next add chicken stock, vermouth, potato, carrot, onion, celery, garlic, bay leaves, and marjoram. Simmer until the vegetables are very tender and the liquid is reduced by 1/3, about 45 minutes.\nNext puree the soup in a blender and return to the pot.\nAdd the cream and the cheese and heat through but don't boil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve with croutons on top.",
