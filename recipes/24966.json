    "des": "\"I love this cake. Makes your whole house smell wonderful. If you can't find butternut flavoring, you can also use vanilla-butternut or a combination of vanilla, butter and any nut flavoring of your choice.  It is important that you bake this cake in a cold oven - do not preheat!\"",

In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the butternut flavoring.
