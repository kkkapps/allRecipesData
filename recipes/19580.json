    "des": "\"Children really love looking at faces. My 2 year old loves eating them, too. This has expanded to an activity called eating dad's face.  My son thinks this is hilarious.  He gobbles the face down.  This meal is not only nutritious but fun and educational as well.  Shape recognition is an important part of reading.\"",
    "ins": "Cut cheese into shapes: squares, triangles, and circles. Place cheese shapes and cherry tomato halves on crackers. Use these, as well as shredded carrot and orange segments to make a face complete with eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and hair--use your imagination! The kids will love it.",
