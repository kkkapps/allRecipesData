    "des": "\"As a young girl, I constantly craved Saturdays and Sundays when my mother would prepare these small delicious pancakes. Now as a college student, I still look forward to Christmas time when our family is together and my mother and I prepare an overwhelming amount to feed family members! Definitely add in any kind of jam, peanut butter, honey, Nutella\u00c2\u00ae, chocolate chips, fruit (diced apples, blueberries, etc.); the possibilities are endless and so delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large bowl; mix in the egg, milk, butter, and vanilla until just combined.\nHeat an aebleskiver pan over medium heat; prepare with cooking spray.\nPour the batter into each cup to about 2/3 full. Allow the batter to cook in the bottom of the cup 3 to 4 minutes until golden brown. Don't forget which cup you placed the batter in first, it's all about rotation! Use a long skewer or knitting needle to lift one edge and give it a 1/4 turn. The uncooked batter will spill over into the cup, and cook. Continue lifting and turning the edges until the batter is fully cooked into a golden brown ball. Drain on paper towels.",
