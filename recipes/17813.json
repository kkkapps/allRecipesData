    "des": "\"The great mix of Thai seasonings makes this a dish that is overflowing with robust and spicy flavors! If you like fusion food, this has a good mix of east and west. I had my guests asking for 'thirds' and 'fourths'!! Serve with your favorite salsa or salad, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "In a food processor, combine chile peppers, green onions, lime zest and juice, 1/2 of the cilantro, fish sauce, lemon grass, salt, sugar and mustard. Blend until smooth. Rinse chicken and cut to appropriate serving size. Place in a bowl with blended ingredients and refrigerate for 1 to 4 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a shallow dish or bowl mix together the bread crumbs, cilantro, cheese, sesame seeds and salt and pepper to taste. Remove chicken from marinade (disposing of any remaining marinade) and roll in crumb mixture until well coated on both sides.\nPlace coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish (if desired, dab with olive oil on top for a crisp finish) and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees F) for 20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.\nNOTE: You can make a dipping sauce by blending 2 green chile peppers with some fish sauce and sugar and topping the blend with some sesame seeds.",
