    "des": "\"I tried to find a recipe for beef stroganoff without sour cream because I didn't have any. The one I found didn't have white wine, which I like. So I took two recipes and combined them, tweaked to our taste. My husband and I really enjoyed what I came up with. Serve with Worcestershire (to add a little zing) over rice or buttered egg noodles.\"",
    "ins": "Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Season with salt. Stir in butter, mushrooms, onion, and garlic; cook until the onions are soft.\nIn a small bowl, stir together white wine and flour. Stir into meat, along with mushroom soup and beef broth. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, allowing to thicken. (If you need more liquid, stir in additional broth.) Serve seasoned with a dash of Worcestershire sauce.",
