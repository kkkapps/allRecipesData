    "ins": "In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, salt,  and herbs.\nHeat milk, water, and 1/4 cup butter until very warm (120-130 degrees F);  stir into dry ingredients.  Stir in egg and enough remaining flour to make soft dough.\nKnead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4-6 minutes.  Cover; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes.\nDivide dough into 3 equal pieces.  Roll each piece to 30 inch rope.  Braid ropes;  pinch ends to seal.  Tie knot in center of braid; wrap ends around knot, in opposite directions, and tuck under to make  round loaf.  Place on greased baking sheet.  Cover; let rise in warm,  draft-free place until doubles in size, about 20 to 40 minutes.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 to 35 minutes or until done, covering with foil during last 10 minutes of baking to prevent excess browning.  Melt remaining butter; brush over loaf.  Sprinkle with additional herbs, if desired.  Remove from sheet; let cool on wire rack.",
