    "des": "\"These wings are easy to make and taste delicious. They turn out slightly crispy outside and tender inside. You can use your favorite barbeque sauce so they turn out just right.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil and lightly brush with 1 teaspoon oil.\nPlace wings in a single layer on the prepared pan, skin-side up, with a little space between each wing. Brush the top of each wing with the 1/3 cup oil. Brush hot sauce over the oil layer.\nBake in the preheated oven, basting with pan juices a few times, until wings are browned, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nRemove pan from oven and soak up excess grease with paper towels. Spread barbeque sauce over top side of wings.\nReturn wings to oven and bake for 5 minutes. Spread a second layer of barbeque sauce over wings; bake for 5 minutes more.",
