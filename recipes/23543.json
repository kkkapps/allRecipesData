    "des": "\"This punch is always a huge hit.  You can serve this with vodka or just on it's own.  Wonderful holiday punch and very refreshing in the summer.  I always freeze sliced oranges and lemons in a mold pan with water.  It makes a more decorative floater than ice cubes.\"",
    "ins": "In a sauce pan, combine water, sugar, crystallized ginger and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.\nPour syrup into a pitcher. Add orange, pineapple and lemon juice. Chill in refrigerator. When ready to serve, pour into a punch bowl and slowly add the lemon-lime soda.",
