    "des": "\"This is a copycat recipe of First Watch\u00c2\u00ae's Quinoa Power Bowl. I think you are really going to enjoy this protein-packed quinoa mixed with grilled chicken, lemon, feta, roasted tomatoes, and shredded carrots. The recipe is quite simple, and the dish is a complete meal all-in-one, so it takes the guesswork out of what side dishes to prepare to ensure a balanced meal of protein, whole grains, and fresh veggies.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken stock and quinoa in a large pot over high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.\nWhisk lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, pepper, and salt in a small bowl to make lemon dressing.\nStir lemon dressing, chicken, water, diced tomatoes, feta cheese, half-and-half, carrots, pesto sauce, and oregano into the cooked quinoa. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thick and creamy, about 15 minutes. Spoon into individual bowls.",
