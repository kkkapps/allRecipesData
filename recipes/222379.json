    "des": "\"A delicious combination that makes each fritter into a mini-meal! The feta and chives add a nice lightly tangy flavor using store bought rotisserie chicken would make this even easier.\"",
    "ins": "Toss zucchini with 1 teaspoon salt in a colander and drain for 10 minutes. Wrap vegetables in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; transfer mixture to a bowl.\nWhisk flour, eggs, milk, seafood seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Stir zucchini, chicken, feta cheese, and chives into the batter until well blended.\nHeat about 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; pan-fry heaping tablespoonfuls of batter in the hot oil in batches, flattening fritters with a spoon to about 3-inches wide, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fritters to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining vegetable oil and batter. Serve with sour cream.",
