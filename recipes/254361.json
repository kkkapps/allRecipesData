    "des": "\"An addictive chicken dish using chicken thighs. The secret is the little bit of sugar used in the browning stage. This recipe is very versatile. You like tomatoes? Add more. You want it thicker or thinner? Adjust the amount of broth. You are in control of your own dinner destiny.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep skillet over low heat. Sprinkle sugar over the bottom. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper; cook in batches until browned, about 5 minutes per side.\nTransfer browned chicken to a plate. Remove skin.\nCook onion in the same skillet until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in tomatoes. Return chicken to the skillet. Pour in enough broth to cover the chicken halfway. Simmer, partially covered, until chicken is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.",
