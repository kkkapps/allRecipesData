    "des": "\"This is the best recipe I've tried for the cookies usually called 'Mexican wedding cookies'.  These just kind of melt in your mouth with no need to chew on them.  The pecan taste is incredible.  They are a must for every Christmas reunion with my family.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMash together the flour, butter, pecans, and 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar in a bowl until the mixture is thoroughly combined and forms a soft dough. Pinch off about 2 teaspoons of dough per cookie, and roll into 3/4-inch balls. Place the balls on ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until the bottoms of the cookies are lightly golden brown but the tops are still pale, 8 to 12 minutes.\nLet the cookies cool completely, then roll in remaining confectioners' sugar.",
