    "ins": "Place butter in a microwave-safe measuring cup. Cover with plastic wrap, leaving room for ventilation. Melt butter in the microwave on high, about 1 minute.\nCombine bread crumbs, apples, water, sugar, raisins, onion, salt, pepper, and sage in a bowl to make stuffing.\nPlace 4 pork chops on the bottom of a microwave-safe baking pan. Divide the stuffing among the chops; cover with the remaining 4 chops. Sprinkle 1/2 of gravy mix on top; add the rest into bottom of the pan. Cover with waxed paper.\nMicrowave on the Roast setting until pork is no longer pink in the center, 18 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand 5 minutes before serving.",
