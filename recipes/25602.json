Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour half of the batter into prepared pan. Blend chocolate sauce with remaining batter. Pour chocolate mixture over top of other batter and fold in gently with spatula for a marble effect.\nBake in the preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.",
