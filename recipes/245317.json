    "des": "\"An Estonian recipe that is somewhat similar to a large latke baked in a sheet pan. In my house you have to fight me for the crispy edge pieces. Tastes great served warm or cold.\"",
    "ins": "Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray baking sheet with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.\nPlace bacon in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until cooked through but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes.\nGrate potatoes, onions, and carrots in a food processor; transfer to a large bowl and mix to combine.\nStir cooked bacon and bacon fat into the potato mixture.\nMix in 2 cups of flour, salt, and pepper and stir well. If filling appears too wet, gradually mix in more flour for a firmer consistency. Spread mixture evenly over lined baking sheet.\nBake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 1 hour. Reduce heat to  350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and cook until lightly browned with crispy edges, about 15 minutes longer.\nCool before slicing, about 10 minutes.",
