    "des": "\"This is a great recipe for busy mothers, and it's excellent with a tossed salad and French bread. It's a ground beef casserole that combines egg noodles, some sherry, and cheese in a tomato sauce base. To reduce the fat content, you may use reduced fat cheese, cut green beans, and 93% lean meat. Also, you may adjust the amount of sherry to taste.\"",
