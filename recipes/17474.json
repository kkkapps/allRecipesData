    "des": "\"This is a rich, fluffy egg custard type pie. My Grandfather loved this pie and the recipe has been handed down through the years. You can cut the sugar in half if so desired. This pie calls for lemon extract, but doesn't taste like lemon.\"",

Pour half of mixture into each pastry shell.\nBake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and bake an additional 35 to 40 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.",
