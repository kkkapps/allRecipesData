Season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; stir to combine.\nReturn pan to medium heat, add potatoes and stir until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Pour in eggs and slowly stir to form large, soft curds, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle feta cheese over the top and stir gently to incorporate.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nPlace pan under the preheated broiler and cook until the top is set and feta cheese is browned, about 5 minutes.",
