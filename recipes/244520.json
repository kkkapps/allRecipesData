    "des": "\"I learned how to make this when I dated a Belizean man for about a year. He is long gone, but I still make his stew and I love it! This is a very healthy dish but the limes and the hot sauce make it very flavorful. Serve with corn or flour tortillas. Each person may want to spice it up with more hot sauce as they prefer.\"",

Cook chicken in the hot oil until browned on the outside, about 5 minutes per side.\nMix chicken broth, cabbage, onion, carrots, green bell pepper, celery, cilantro, tomato sauce, lime juice, garlic, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper into chicken and simmer, adding water if needed, until stew is thickened, about 2 hours.\nLadle stew into bowls and top each with a piece of chicken.",
