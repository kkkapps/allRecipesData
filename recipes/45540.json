    "des": "\"A wonderful breakfast treat that's way better than anything you can buy in a box! Use the baking nuts that aren't salted or roasted.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the oil, hot water and honey. In a large bowl, stir together the oats, almonds, pecans, and walnuts. Pour the honey mixture into the oat mixture and stir until the oats and nuts are evenly coated. Spread out the granola onto 2 baking sheets.\nBake for 10 minutes, stir, and bake 10 more minutes, or until toasted. Allow granola to cool completely before stirring in the raisins, golden raisins and dried cherries. Granola will harden as it cools. Break apart any large lumps, and store in an airtight container at room temperature.",
