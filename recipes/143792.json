    "des": "\"My boyfriend and I made a rather large turkey breast and it was just the two of us, which meant a lot of leftover turkey meat!  A few days later, I had to come up with something quick for dinner, and used things I had on hand.  It's not exactly gourmet but a good take on the nostalgic dish and everyone at work the next day said it smelled GREAT! Serve over hot buttered rice.\"",
    "ins": "Stir the cream of chicken soup into the one soup can of water in a bowl.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, stir in mushrooms and carrot, and cook and stir until mushrooms start to give up their liquid and carrot begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add shredded turkey, onion powder, salt, pepper, bay leaf, and sherry to the pan and cook, stirring, another 5 minutes to reduce pan juices and cook away the alcohol from the wine.\nPour the soup over the turkey mixture and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and add the half-and-half, parsley, and frozen peas.  Simmer 5 to 10 minutes to reduce the sauce and heat the peas through.  Remove bay leaf and stir in butter just before serving.",
