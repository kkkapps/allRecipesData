    "des": "\"My husband and I were vacationing recently and had this lovely French toast at a bed and breakfast.  When we came back home, I kept missing it so I called them up and requested it.  They actually gave me the recipe over the phone!  I generally halve the recipe for my husband and I, and bake it in an 8 inch square pan.  Reheats well in the toaster oven.  I served it to my in-laws recently and they loved it. Serve with a little sweetened whipped cream and berries!\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, melted butter, and corn syrup. Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and spread evenly. Sprinkle pecans over the sugar mixture. Arrange the bread slices in the bottom of the dish so they are in a snug single layer.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the orange zest, orange juice, milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, egg whites, and eggs. Pour this mixture over the bread, pressing on the bread slices to help absorb the liquid. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees  F (175 degrees C ). Remove the cover from the baking dish, and let stand for 20 minutes at room temperature.\nBake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.",
