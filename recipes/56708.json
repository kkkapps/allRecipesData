    "des": "\"This salmon is my husband's favorite. Don't let the total time fool you -- very easy to make.  This recipe is great served with mashed potatoes. You can taste the sauce before marinating to check the flavor. This gives a nice sweet taste to the salmon.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and mix in the honey, brown, sugar, and coconut. Bring to a boil, and remove from heat. Cool slightly, and transfer to a large bowl. Place the salmon in the bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover, and marinate at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSpread enough of the marinade mixture in a baking dish to coat the bottom.  Arrange the salmon in the dish, and pour some of the marinade over the top, being sure to get some of the coconut on the top.\nBake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, basting occasionally with the remaining marinade, until the salmon is flaked easily with a fork. Discard any leftover marinade, or bring to a boil, cook for 5 minutes, and spoon over salmon.",
