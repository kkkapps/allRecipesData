    "des": "\"After searching high and low for a recipe that is tasty but very crispy, this was created from taking various recipe finds and merging them. The secret is in the cornmeal/flour mixture, as well as the cast-iron skillet.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken drumsticks and thighs in a bowl and pour enough buttermilk over chicken to cover. Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.\nCombine flour, cornmeal, granulated onion, granulated garlic, thyme, salt, paprika, monosodium glutamate, baking powder, and cayenne pepper in a large, wide bowl.\nRemove chicken from buttermilk and shake off excess. Discard buttermilk. Pat chicken dry with paper towels.\nDip chicken into egg whites and press into flour mixture. Allow coated chicken to rest on a wire rack for 20 to 30 minutes.\nFill a cast-iron skillet or deep fryer with vegetable oil about 1/3 full. Heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPreheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nFry chicken in hot oil in batches until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes per side. Thighs may take longer to fry than drumsticks. Transfer fried chicken to a wire rack or a paper towel-lined tray to drain. Keep chicken warm in preheated oven while frying remaining pieces.",
