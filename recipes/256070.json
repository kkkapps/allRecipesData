    "des": "\"Add a new dimension to your homemade nut milk by roasting a variety of nuts for a robust flavor. Delicious on its own or give your favorite recipe a boost by using this instead of dairy or plain alternative milks. It's amazing in coffee! Use the leftover pulp for smoothies, cookies, or pie crusts.\"",

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread nuts onto baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes; shake the baking sheet to flip the nuts.
