    "des": "\"We had these at an Irish Pub, they were to die for. A combination we thought wouldn't taste too good but all the patrons said it was the best thing on the menu, and they were right!  Corned beef, coleslaw and sauce inside a flour tortilla.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, lime juice, cilantro, cayenne pepper, and salt in a bowl until smooth.\nPlace the corned beef in a saucepan over medium-low heat just until hot. Place a tortilla into a heavy skillet over medium heat until hot and just beginning to show brown spots, about 30 seconds per side. To assemble, arrange about 2 tablespoons of coleslaw on a tortilla; follow with 3 tablespoons of corned beef. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the yogurt sauce; roll up to serve.",
