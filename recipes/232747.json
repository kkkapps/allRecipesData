    "des": "\"The plums absorb the full-bodied spiciness of the salsa to give it a light, smoky-sweet flavor. Perfect as a side or snack on a hot summer day or as an accompaniment to tacos or grilled pork. This salsa can be heated up to taste by adding more or hotter varieties of peppers. As is, this salsa would probably be classified as mild.\"",
