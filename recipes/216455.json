    "des": "\"This is a great appetizer using wild duck breast. It reminds me of an appetizer I've had at formal gatherings that uses chicken livers.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk the sherry, soy sauce, peanut oil, and ginger together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Cut the duck breast into 16 pieces and place into the marinade along with the water chestnuts; toss to coat. Set aside to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nDrain the marinade from the duck meat and discard. Place a duck piece onto a water chestnut, and wrap with half a bacon slice. Secure with a toothpick, and place onto a broiler pan. Repeat with remaining ingredients.\nBroil until the bacon is just crisp, about 10 minutes, turning once.",
