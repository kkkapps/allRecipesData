    "des": "\"This two-ingredient icing goes together in almost no time, and dresses up plain brownies or a sheet cake. Use less yogurt if you want it to be thicker. This is ready to spread on a cool flat cake or brownies or can be used on a Bundt\u00c2\u00ae cake, where it will run down a bit. It will harden in the refrigerator, so it's best to serve immediately or let your dessert reach room temperature before serving, but store any leftover in the refrigerator.\"",
