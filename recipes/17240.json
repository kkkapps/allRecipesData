They can be served in chicken soup (similar to won ton soup) or fried and served as a side dish. This recipe is for ground beef kreplach but you could also use chicken or other vegetables to make a vegetarian version. If you prefer, you may leave the cinnamon and walnuts out of this recipe.\"",

Remove from heat and let cool.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, eggs, and water; mix until dough is smooth.
