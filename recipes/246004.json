    "des": "\"I love Reese's\u00c2\u00ae peanut butter chips and peanut butter in general. I wanted to create a fun recipe that combines my lust for sweets with my practical need to eat healthy food. This recipe is great for kids who are picky \neaters, or brunch hosts who want to add whimsy to the orange juice mimosas and sausage.\"",
    "ins": "Bring milk and salt just to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in farina gradually; return to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low; simmer until cereal thickens, about 2 1/2 minutes.\nRemove cereal from heat; cool for 3 minutes. Pour cereal into 2 bowls; stir 1 tablespoon peanut butter chips into each bowl.",
