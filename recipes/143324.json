    "des": "\"I always loved fava beans stewed Portuguese style. But there is always something missing from the recipes I have. I adjusted the spices and added some chourico, a Portuguese sausage similar to linguica or chorizo. I think this version makes a great dish. Make sure you have plenty of crusty bread for dipping in the sauce!\"",
    "ins": "Warm the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until golden brown. Stir in the chile paste, tomato sauce, water, parsley, salt, pepper, paprika, and sausage.\nBring the sausage mixture to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes. Mix in the fava beans and cook 10 minutes for firm beans, or up to 30 minutes for softer beans.",
