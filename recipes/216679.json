    "des": "\"This simple compote is a great accompaniment to roasted lamb or beef. We live in Flathead cherry country so that's what I use, but any sweet dark cherry will work. If using frozen cherries, it usually isn't necessary to add the water.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the cherries, sugar, rosemary, and water in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until cherries are tender and sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or cold.",
