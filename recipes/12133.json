    "ins": "Whisk the flour and salt together in a medium size bowl.  With a pastry blender, cut in the cold shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Drizzle 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water over flour.  Toss mixture with a fork to moisten, adding more water a few drops at a time until the dough comes together.\nGently gather dough particles together into a ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes before rolling.\nRoll out dough, and put in a pie plate.  Fill with desired filling and bake.",
