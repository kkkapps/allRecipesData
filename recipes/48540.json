Roll each section into a six inch circle (approximately 1/8 inch thick). Set aside.\nMelt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until soft and translucent. Stir in ground beef. Season with 1 teaspoon curry powder, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Cook until beef is evenly brown, stirring constantly. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat.\nSpoon equal amounts of filling into each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half circle.  Use a fork to press edges, and brush the top of each patty with beaten egg.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.",
