    "ins": "Combine the pomegranate juice, wine, and lemon juice in a bowl. Whisk in the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. Crumble in half of the brown sugar and whisk mixture until sugar dissolves.\nMelt the butter in a skillet over medium heat and swirl to coat the pan. Immediately pour in the juice/spice mixture and increase the heat to high. Bring mixture to a boil while whisking to prevent scorching. Reduce heat to medium and, while stirring, add the remaining brown sugar a little at a time. Cook and stir until mixture thickens to a syrupy consistency or when it can coat the back of a spoon.\nRemove from heat and allow to cool slightly and continue to cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir and serve.",
