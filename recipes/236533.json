    "ins": "Heat grapeseed oil in a large skillet over medium heat; saute onion until softened and slightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a small bowl, reserving the oil in the skillet.\nLightly brush each bread slice with grapeseed oil from the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Arrange half the bread slices, oil-side down, in the skillet. Top each bread slice with 1 slice Gouda cheese, 1 slice provolone cheese, artichoke hearts, and onion; top with remaining bread slices, oil-side up.\nCook sandwiches until bread is browned and crispy and cheeses are melted, about 4 minutes per side. Slice each sandwich in half to serve.",
