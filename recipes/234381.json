    "ins": "Preheat smoker to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and add 1 cup wood chips to start the smoke rolling.\nLiberally coat chicken wings with about 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning.\nPlace wings directly on the grate in the smoker or in an aluminum pan with holes to allow airflow. Add more wood chips as needed to continue smoke. Smoke wings for 2 hours.\nCombine butter, garlic, and 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning in a large saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Stir hot sauce into butter mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPreheat grill to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCook wings, 10 to 12 at a time, in the deep fryer until no wings are longer pink in the center and are lightly browned on the outside, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove wings from the oil with a slotted spoon, letting excess oil drain from the wings.\nPlace cooked wings on a baking sheet and liberally coat each wing with hot sauce mixture.\nPlace coated wings directly onto the grates of the preheated grill; cook until sauce has caramelized and wings are crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side.",
