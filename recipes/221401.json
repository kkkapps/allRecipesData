    "des": "\"While growing up, my Polish-Russian grandmother, who lived with our family, made these little meat patties quite often and they were a family favorite. Here is my rendition, from what I remember when cooking with Grandma, as she never wrote the recipe down. The patties were always served with mashed potatoes, green beans, applesauce, and, of course, plenty of ketchup for the patties.\"",
    "ins": "Mix ground beef, cracker crumbs, onion, egg, milk, garlic, kosher salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until evenly blended. Shape meat mixture into twelve 3-inch patties about 1 1/4-inch thick.\nHeat vegetable shortening in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear patties until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, uncovered, until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes more. Remove patties from skillet and drain on paper towels until ready to serve.",
