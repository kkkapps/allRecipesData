    "des": "\"I make this nearly every year for Thanksgiving, and it's always a hit. I usually make it dairy-free using almond milk, but it's possible to do with cow's milk as well. Taking a bit of a detour from the traditional pumpkin pie flavor with the added chai spice, this is a great dish for adding an extra bit of spice (pun intended) to your Thanksgiving this year.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBring almond milk to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat; add chai tea bags. Let tea steep for at least 5 minutes.\nMix pumpkin puree, sugar, ground flax seeds, cinnamon, vegetable oil, and salt together in a large bowl until completely smooth. Pour in chai-flavored almond milk; stir again until smooth. Pour filling into the pie shell.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.",
