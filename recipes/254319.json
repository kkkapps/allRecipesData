    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSift all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and cocoa powder together in a large bowl. Stir in oats and ground flax seeds.\nBeat bananas, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well-blended. Beat in sugar. Mix in flour mixture until dough is sticky.\nRoll a teaspoonful of dough into a ball with your hands and place on a nonstick baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges look dry but cookies are still soft, about 8 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets until set and easily handled, about 10 minutes.",
