    "des": "\"You can cook up a chicken or turkey carcass, or add stock and leftover turkey. Great way to end the Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey. I lost this recipe and spent two months searching for it. When it fell out of an unexpected book, I was thrilled and made the soup right away. If you like barley and mushrooms, you will love this soup.\"",
    "ins": "Bring the barley and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the barley is tender, about 30 minutes.\nMelt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, salt, and bay leaves. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the carrot and celery; cook for 5 more minutes. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the mushrooms, dill, soy sauce, turkey broth, and cooked barley; season to taste with pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 1/2 hours.",
