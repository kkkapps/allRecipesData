    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat brown sugar, white sugar, and butter together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add 1 egg one at a time, allowing the first to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next with the vanilla.\nStir flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Beat into the butter mixture until just incorporated into a dough. Fold oats, crispy rice cereal, and coconut into the dough; mixing just enough to evenly combine.\nDrop cookie dough by teaspoonful onto baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until browned, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool cookies slightly on baking sheets before moving to cooling racks to cool completely.",
