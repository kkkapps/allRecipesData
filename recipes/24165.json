    "des": "\"At a recent party our friends went wild over this. A simple pesto is spread on Italian bread and layered with roma tomatoes and cheese. It takes a little time, but it is worth it.  I freeze the basil in ice cube trays, then put the cubes in freezer bags. You can easily take out and thaw what you need. Enjoy!\"",

Continue processing until desired consistency is reached.\nPreheat the broiler.\nSlice Italian bread to desired thickness. Spread a layer of pesto on each slice. Top with roma (plum) tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.\nPlace topped bread slices in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Broil 5 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.",
