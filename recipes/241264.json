Discard brine.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sprinkle pepper over the pork chops.\nMelt butter and olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat; cook pork chops until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip pork chops and season with rosemary; add apples. Cover skillet.\nBake in the preheated oven until pork chops are cooked through, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pork chops from skillet and allow to rest a few minutes before serving.",
