    "ins": "Whisk together flour and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add milk and water, stirring to combine. Mix in salt and beat until smooth.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Tilt pan with a circular motion so batter coats the surface evenly.\nCook crepe until bottom is light brown, about 2 minutes. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook other side. Serve hot with yogurt, maple syrup, and blueberries.",
