This is a calorie-fest however, so be certain to offset all that sinful goodness with a crisp salad! Feel free to change or add ingredients as you go along! We don't usually bother with measurements!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the chicken wings in a roasting pan. Season with salt. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, peach chutney, onion soup mix and hot water. Pour this over the chicken wings.\nBake in the preheated oven until the sauce is brown and sticky, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.",
