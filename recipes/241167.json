    "ins": "Lightly oil the grate of your grill. Arrange lemon slices on the grate so they overlap slightly and form a shape slightly larger than your trout fillet.\nPreheat grill for medium heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat.\nSaute garlic and onion in the hot oil until the garlic browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Squeeze the reserved lemon ends over the garlic mixture.\nGently lay the trout fillet onto the lemons with the skin side down. Brush the garlic mixture over the top of the fish.\nCook trout on hot grill until the fish flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.",
