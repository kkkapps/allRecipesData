    "des": "\"In this non-traditional steak sandwich, the steak is cut into thick strips, so we're able to get a nice sear on the outside without having to worry about the inside overcooking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCut steak into 6 thick strips. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nGrill mushrooms for 5-6 minutes over medium-high heat until they begin to wilt. Remove the stem end to separate the mushrooms.\nStir mushrooms in a bowl with salt and pepper, sherry vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil. Set aside.\nGrill steaks for 3-4 minutes per side over medium-high heat, until medium rare or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let rest for 5 minutes.\nWhisk together barbeque sauce, cider vinegar and vegetable oil. Set aside.\nServe grilled steaks on hot dog buns with mayonnaise, arugula, cherry tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, and barbeque sauce mixture.",
