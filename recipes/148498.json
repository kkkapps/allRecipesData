    "des": "\"This was my stepfather's crowd-pleasing recipe. It's simple to make, and the longer the shrimp sit, the better! You can prepare the shrimp a day ahead, refrigerate, and reheat before serving. The leftover liquid can be frozen and used to make great gumbo.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the salt and shrimp. Pour the beer over the shrimp, and simmer just until the shrimp turn pink. Turn off the heat, and allow the shrimp to sit at least 1/2 hour. Serve while still warm, or refrigerate and reheat before serving.",
