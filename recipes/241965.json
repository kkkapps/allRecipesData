    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add sausage; cook and stir, breaking up the sausage until no longer pink. Use a slotted spoon to transfer sausage to a dish.\nCook garlic in the skillet for 30 seconds; add mushrooms and saute until tender. Transfer to the dish with the sausage.\nPour water and Ragu(R) Classic Alfredo sauce into the skillet; whisk to blend. Bring to a boil.\nAdd broken lasagna noodles to the skillet; reduce heat to medium. Simmer until the noodles are tender, about 12 to 15 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent pasta from sticking to bottom of the pan.\nReturn sausage and mushrooms to the pan; reduce heat to low. Stir in spinach; cook until just wilted. Add ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, stirring until the mozzarella is melted and the ricotta is well combined.",
