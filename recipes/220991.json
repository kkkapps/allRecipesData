    "des": "\"Contrary to popular belief, souffles are not very difficult, as long as you respect the laws of physics. I hope you give this recipe a try, and also experiment with other vegetables. Broccoli, artichokes, leeks, spinach, or any other edible plant you can puree should work with the same basic procedure.\"",
    "ins": "Cook asparagus in a saucepan of boiling water until bright green but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Transfer asparagus to ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 2 minutes.\nWhisk milk into butter-flour mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until thick, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and cayenne pepper.\nPlace milk mixture, garlic, and asparagus in a blender and puree until smooth.\nPour asparagus mixture into a large bowl; stir in egg yolks and Cheddar cheese.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)\nGenerously butter 4 (6-ounce) ramekins\nBeat egg whites in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak\nStir half of egg whites into asparagus cheese mixture until just combined. Gently fold remaining egg whites into mixture.\nFill prepared ramekins about 3/4 full and place on a baking sheet; bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes",
