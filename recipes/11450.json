    "des": "\"I worked with a woman that baked 80 dozen or more cookies during the holidays. Every day she brought 1/2 dozen of every cookie she'd baked the night before; this is my favorite. I sometimes roll the dough into balls and then roll them in some granulated sugar rather than making these as drop cookies. These freeze well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets. Stir together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt; set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla. Gradually stir in flour mixture until smooth. Stir in nuts. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten cookies with a fork.\nBake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown. Cool on baking sheets for a minute before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.",
