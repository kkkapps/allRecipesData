    "des": "\"This is another odd kielbasa recipe that surprises everyone.  It's always a winner at parties. The best type of honey mustard for this recipe is a mustard with more honey texture than mustard. Very easy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to broil. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Slice kielbasa diagonally into 1/4 inch pieces.\nIn a medium-size skillet saute kielbasa in ginger ale until they are heated through. Drain well. Arrange the kielbasa on the prepared baking sheet, then sprinkle them with brown sugar.\nBroil the kielbasa until the brown sugar melts and begins to crystallize, check after 3 to 5 minutes. Serve the kielbasa with honey mustard for dipping.",
