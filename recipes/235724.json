    "des": "\"My 2-year-old was diagnosed with Celiac. After experimenting with several failed chicken nugget recipes, I finally came up with one the whole family loves. This is a mild-tasting chicken nugget designed for a 2-year-old. Some additional seasoning added to the Chex\u00c2\u00ae should give it a more 'grown up' flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Blend cereal in a blender or food processor until it has the consistency of bread crumbs; pour into a bowl.\nBeat eggs in a separate bowl until smooth. Pour rice flour into a third bowl.\nDredge chicken pieces in the rice flour, dip in beaten egg, and then press into the cereal to coat. Keep breaded chicken on a large plate until all are finished, but do not stack.\nPour enough oil into a large skillet to just cover the bottom and heat over medium-high heat.\nCook chicken nuggets in hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
