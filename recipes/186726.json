    "ins": "Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the shallot; cook until the shallot has softened and turned translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour in the wine, cream, chicken broth, and lemon juice. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Stir in the rosemary, season to taste with salt.",
