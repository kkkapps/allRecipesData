    "des": "\"Use this toward the end of cooking as you would for any BBQ meat such as pork, ribs, or chicken. I have even used it on beef and hamburgers, sausages, hot dogs, or anything you want, for the most part.  I use it on everything from ribs to roasts to hamburgers to hot dogs. Even goes good with a good old classic grilled cheese sandwich. This is a great all-round BBQ sauce. Use right away or cool to room temperature, transfer to jars or containers, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several months in the fridge.\"",
    "ins": "Mix vinegar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, Worcestershire sauce, rum, mustard, liquid smoke, ground chile, black pepper, garlic powder, and allspice together in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until sauce is smooth and brown sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.\nStir ketchup into sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is dark and thickened, about 30 minutes.",
