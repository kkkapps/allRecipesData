    "des": "\"Incorporating ideas from other reviewers, I adapted the skillet version to a slow cooker version when we needed a meal to be ready when we got home. We loved this over hot biscuits. The ultimate comfort food with veggies included! Don't let the spices scare you and don't skimp on them. Their presence makes this a totally delicious meal!\"",
    "ins": "Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat with onion and garlic until the meat is completely browned, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.\nStir cream of mushroom soup, vegetable broth, vegetable juice cocktail, sherry, and Worcestershire sauce together in a slow cooker. Add beef mixture; stir in potatoes, corn, peas, carrots, mushroom pieces, celery flakes, salt, black pepper, marjoram, and thyme. Set cooker to Low, cover, and cook until vegetables are tender and sauce has thickened, about 8 hours. If preferred, set cooker on High and cook 4 hours.",
