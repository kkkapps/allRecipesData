    "des": "\"Work that smoker magic on corn on cob. Be sure to get the corn before the produce person trims off some of the outer husks. The corn must be completely covered by the husk. Use peeled back husks for handles when eating. This recipe multiplies well, and can be used to make corn for a crowd. You will need bagged ice for this recipe to keep the corn cold.\"",
    "ins": "Place whole ears of corn in an ice chest. Pour beer over top. Dump ice out over the ears of corn. Place the lid on the cooler, and let sit 8 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat smoker to 250 degrees F ( 120 degrees C).\nPlace corn in the smoker and close the lid. Cook for 1 to 2 hours, turning every 20 minutes or so. Kernels should give easily under pressure when done. To eat, just peel back the husks and use them for a handle.",
