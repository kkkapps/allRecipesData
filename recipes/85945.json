    "des": "\"Nothing's more comforting than grilled cheese and tomato soup.  This is a gussied-up version, with grilled Brie cheese sandwiches and spiced tomato bisque with basil.  As the soup soaks into the sandwich, break into pieces with your spoon and ladle up with the soup.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven or a toaster oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread the Brie cheese onto two slices of bread, and top with remaining slices. Place on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 8 minutes, turning once halfway through. Cut in half, and set aside.\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, stir together the tomato puree, red pepper flakes, black pepper, basil, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes.\nWhisk in the cream cheese until well blended, then stir in the milk. Heat through without bringing to a boil. Stir in the fresh basil, and remove from the heat.\nTo serve, place each sandwich half into a separate bowl. Ladle soup over each one into the bowl. Serve immediately.",
