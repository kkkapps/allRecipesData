    "ins": "Mix together the pork sausage, bread crumbs, onion, water chestnuts, egg, sherry, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger in a bowl until evenly combined. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to make the mixture easier to handle, then form into 6 patties.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nCook the burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Lightly toast the buns on the hot grill. Serve the burgers on the toasted buns, and top with bean sprouts and sweet and sour sauce.",
