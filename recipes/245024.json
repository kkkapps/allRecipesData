    "des": "\"I love pumpkin ravioli, but I'm almost never in the mood for all that work. This recipe was my compromise! It uses store bought ravioli (fresh or frozen) with a homemade pumpkin sauce. If you prefer the sauce to be savory, reduce the sugar and add garlic powder for a kick. I usually serve this with a nice, fresh salad.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a pot of water to a boil.\nCombine chicken broth, pumpkin puree, milk, brown sugar, white sugar, butter, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until butter melts and sauce is heated through, about 10 minutes.\nCook ravioli in the boiling water until they float to the top and the filling is hot, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl. Top pasta with pumpkin sauce and Parmesan cheese.",
