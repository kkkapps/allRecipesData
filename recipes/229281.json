    "des": "\"This delicious, creamy dressing is  non-dairy and gluten-free. My meat-and-potato husband loves it on his grilled chicken, steak, and spread on his burgers. I love it as a substitute for mayonnaise in tuna sandwiches. This will be spicy! If you omit the adobo and chipotle, this makes a great recipe base for other creamy dressings. Rice milk can be used for the soy milk. Use your favorite fresh herbs in place of the dill. You can make sauce thinner with the addition of more soy milk.\"",
    "ins": "Blend tofu, soy milk, olive oil, lemon juice, honey, garlic powder, salt, cumin, and black pepper in a blender until smooth. Scrape the sides of the blender with a spatula as needed. Add chipotle peppers and adobo sauce a little bit at a time and blend into the sauce, tasting after each addition until you meet the level of spiciness you desire.\nTransfer sauce to a bowl. Stir dill into the sauce to serve.",
