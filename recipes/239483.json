    "des": "\"Combination of 2 classic recipes: bread pudding and pumpkin pie. I put this together on a whim and loved it. Taste is more comforting than sweet. Great served warm or cold and can be complemented with whipped cream or milk.\"",
    "ins": "Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nSpread bread cubes into the prepared baking dish.\nMix raisins, maple-flavored extract, and rum-flavored extract together in a bowl; pour in enough water to almost cover raisins. Heat raisin mixture in microwave until raisins are plump, about 1 1/2 minutes; set aside to cool slightly.\nBeat milk, pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, raisin mixture, brown sugar, butter, molasses, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger together in a large bowl until smooth; pour over bread. Set mixture aside until bread has absorbed the liquid, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.",
