    "des": "\"I was in the process of tweaking a Zucchini Carrot Muffin recipe to my taste when we found out we couldn't have gluten. This recipe is now better that any of the gluten efforts. I try to keep these in the freezer, but have trouble staying ahead of the crowd.\"",
    "ins": "Lightly grease 18 muffin cups.\nSift brown rice flour, tapioca starch, potato starch, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a bowl.\nPlace quinoa, flax seeds, almonds, and sunflower seeds in a coffee grinder; process until mixture is finely ground. Add mixture to rice flour mixture.\nBeat eggs, yogurt, brown sugar, coconut oil, agave nectar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Stir rice flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is just blended. Fold zucchini, carrot, apple, and raisins into batter; divide evenly between prepared muffin cups. Let batter rest for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
