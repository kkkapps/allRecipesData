    "des": "\"The Foglie D Autunno, or Autumn Leaves pasta, is from the heel region of Italy. One brand is Castellana and should be available at specialty food stores. The flavorings in this colorful pasta leaves are from turmeric, carrot juice, squid ink, spinach leaves, and tomatoes. This rendering of the pasta dish has a remarkable clean taste that really makes it special. It is sure to impress your family and guests.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot bring 6 quarts of unsalted water to boil. Cook pasta until al dente. Drain well. Place pasta back in the pot, add one Tablespoon of olive oil and mix to prevent the leaves from sticking together. Cover and keep warm while the sauce finishes simmering.\nWarm oven-safe dinner plates in a 150 degree F(65 degree C) oven.\nMeanwhile, in a 12 inch saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over medium high heat. Add the minced garlic and saute until the aromatic oils are released - about 1 minute. Add the chopped onion and bell pepper and saute 3 minutes. Add the cubed chicken breast, dried thyme, dried basil, rubbed sage, salt, and black pepper. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink. Add the Chardonnay and Burgundy wines, and pasta sauce and heat until bubbling. Add the Portobella mushroom pieces and cook until the mixture has reduced and is thick and hot.\nTo serve, place two large serving spoonfuls of Autumn Leaves on each warmed plate and top with a large ladle of the chicken and Portobella sauce.",
