    "des": "\"This noodle kugel is a sweet casserole that feels like comfort food (especially if you are of Jewish heritage) yet is low fat and lower sugar than the average sweet kugel. I use the low-fat dairy and egg substitute to give it a richer flavor, but it tastes great made with nonfat ingredients as well. Enjoy! I developed it in honor of my beloved Grandma Sylvia.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.\nGently stir egg noodles, sour cream, cottage cheese, pineapple with juice, eggs, orange juice, cranberries, melted butter, sugar, applesauce, orange zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Spoon the noodle mixture into prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until kugel is set and browned on top, 60 to 75 minutes.",
