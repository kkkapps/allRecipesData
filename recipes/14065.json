    "des": "\"Fresh summer vegetables paired with creamy polenta baked in an Italian sauce and topped with cheese -- delicioso!  I recommend serving it with crusty garlic bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSaute carrots, zucchini, squash, onion and bell pepper in a large saucepan with a small amount of olive oil.  Season with garlic salt and pepper. Saute vegetables for approximately 5 minutes and pour in spaghetti sauce.  Stir, cover and simmer until vegetables are slightly tender.\nSlice polenta into 1/2 inch circles and season with garlic salt and pepper. Heat enough oil in a medium skillet so as to completely cover the entire bottom of the pan. Pan fry seasoned polenta in hot oil, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from oil and layer the slices in a large casserole dish. Spoon the vegetable mixture over the polenta and then sprinkle with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.\nBake casserole for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
