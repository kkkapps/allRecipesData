    "des": "\"I love lemon poppy seed muffins and who doesn't love pancakes? So I brought the flavors together in this fluffy pancake recipe one lazy Sunday morning, and we loved them. It's quick to make and adds a little something extra to our weekend breakfasts. I hope you enjoy them on YOUR lazy Sunday morning.\"",
    "ins": "Stir the milk, vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl; let stand 10 minutes to curdle. Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla extract.\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, poppy seeds, and lemon zest until well combined. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk a few times until the batter is mostly free of lumps.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup of  batter per pancake into the skillet  and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes over with a spatula and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.",
