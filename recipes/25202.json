Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the beef strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips.\nStir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.\nFive minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste.",
