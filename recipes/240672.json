Add hot water, butter, and egg; stir until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Spread dough into prepared baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Press dimples into the top of the dough with your fingertips.\nScatter crumbled sardines over the top of the dough, sprinkle garlic over sardines, and top with Parmesan cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and fragrant, about 30 minutes.",
