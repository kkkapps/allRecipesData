    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSeason pork chops with salt, pepper, and paprika. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute the garlic about 1 minute, then brown pork chops about 2 minutes on each side.\nIn a pot, bring the vegetable broth and rice to a boil. Mix in the Italian-style diced tomatoes, green bell pepper, orange bell pepper, green onions, and mushrooms, and cook about 5 minutes, until heated through. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange the pork chops over the rice and vegetables.\nCover, and bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until rice and vegetables are tender and pork has reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
