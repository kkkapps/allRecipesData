    "ins": "About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine salt, sugars, black pepper, chili powder, garlic powder and cayenne in small bowl; mix well.  Generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce.  Whisk together all ingredients in bowl.\nHeat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 degrees F.\nPlace the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours until very tender, basting with barbecue sauce every hour.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.\nServe ribs with remaining barbecue sauce.",
