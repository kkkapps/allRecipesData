    "des": "\"This is a classic recipe I use and love. Nutritional yeast is substituted for the traditionally used dairy. Tasty on pasta, bread, sandwiches, omelets, etc. Try adding sun-dried tomato slices post-completion for an added boost of rich flavor. P.S. - It also freezes beautifully.\"",
    "ins": "Place the pine nuts in a skillet over medium heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted.\nGradually mix the pine nuts, olive oil, garlic, nutritional yeast, and basil in a food processor, and process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.",
