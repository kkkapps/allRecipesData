    "des": "\"This is the Jewish equivalent to biscotti. It was handed down through three generations. I added the mini chocolate chips. The cookies are twice baked, first in logs and then in slices.  Stored in an airtight container, these will keep for about two weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease a cookie sheet.\nBeat together the eggs, oil, sugar, and vanilla extract until well blended.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder; and stir into the egg mixture until well mixed.  Fold in the chocolate chips and almonds.  Form two logs, three inches in diameter, and place onto the baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, then remove from the oven and cut into 1 inch diagonal slices.  Lay the slices on their sides on the cookie sheet and return to the oven for 10 minutes.  Remove  to cool on a wire rack.",
