    "des": "\"Very easy recipe for oven roasted salmon fillets with a maple-rum glaze. The first time I made it this instantly eclipsed another salmon recipe (with an orange-ginger sauce) that we had used and loved for years. Some folks might write this off due to the mustard, but the flavors blend so well it is undetectable.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk rum, maple syrup, and mustard together in a large glass or ceramic dish until marinade is well-combined. Place fillets in marinade and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nRemove salmon from marinade, and shake off excess. Place fillets in a glass baking dish. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until glaze is reduced, about 10 minutes; set aside.\nBake fillets in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Top fillets with glaze.",
