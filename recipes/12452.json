    "ins": "Divide pastry in three equal parts. Roll 1/3 to make 8x15 inch rectangle. Trim edges and cut to make two 7-inch squares. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with other two thirds of pastry.\nArrange layer of potatoes on half of each pastry square, top with layer of onion and then with meat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with butter.\nMoisten pastry edges with cold water and fold over to make triangles; press edges together to make tight seal. A tight seal retains steam and makes juicy pastries.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour or until meat is tender. Serve hot with chili sauce, ketchup, or pickle relish or serve cold for sandwiches.",
