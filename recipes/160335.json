Whisk together the egg, olive oil, and salt in a larger bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk in the semolina until a soft dough has formed.\nDrop the dumpling dough by the teaspoonful into the boiling water. Boil until the dumplings float to the surface and have grown in size, about 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve immediately.",
