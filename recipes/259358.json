    "des": "\"I liked the Ezekiel bread recipe on this site. I need high-protein bread, so I researched the Bible and other cookbooks and I came up with this recipe. It can be halved and the grains or beans can be removed as your tastes prefer.  I hope you like this. My family and church members certainly did! Bread can be eaten right away or wrapped and frozen whole or sliced. Drink plenty of water when eating this bread. This bread is very low in carbs so it is a good bread to diet on.\"",
    "ins": "Place lentils, pinto beans, white beans, great Northern beans, and red beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak 8 hours to overnight.\nDrain lentils, pinto beans, white beans, Northern beans, and red beans; combine in a large pot. Add 1 cup warm water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook until tender, adding more water if needed, about 45 minutes. Cool to room temperature.\nDissolve 1 tablespoon honey, 2 cups bread flour, and 2 packages yeast in 2 cups warm water in a bowl to make the starter.\nMix wheat germ, wheat and barley cereal, flax seeds, spelt, oat bran, oats, and millet together in a bowl. Add 2 cups warm water, 2 packages yeast, and 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour; stir until well combined.\nPuree bean mixture in a food processor; transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the starter and wheat germ mixture; mix. Add the 1 cup water, remaining honey, canola oil, sugar, and salt; mix to combine. Add the remaining 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour in batches, mixing thoroughly after each addition; stir until no dry spots remain.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place in a large, lightly-oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover with a towel; let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nGrease 3 large loaf pans. Divide dough equally and place into the prepared pans. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.\nRemove loaves from pans and return to oven, placed upside-down on the bare oven rack. Continue baking until bottoms are browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven; let cool.",
