    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.\nToss ham chunks, tomatoes, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, green onions, garlic, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl.\nStir drained bow-tie pasta and mayonnaise into the ham mixture.\nSprinkle cilantro and Romano cheese over the pasta mixture; stir to combine.\nChill at least 1 hour before serving.",
