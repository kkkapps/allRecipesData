    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat eggs, water, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until smooth; add brownie mix and stir until the mixture is a smooth batter. Beat mashed banana into batter; fold in walnuts. Pour batter into a 13x9-inch baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 23 minutes.\nCool brownies at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting into bars. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar over the brownies.",
