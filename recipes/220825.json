    "des": "\"These grapes were served to me after a massage at my local spa. This recipe is perfect as an after-school snack, a simple appetizer at parties, or a sweet treat before bed. Substitute Splenda\u00c2\u00ae for the sugar if you like! Can be kept in a sealed bag in the freezer for several months.\"",
