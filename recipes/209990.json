    "des": "\"My father made this while I was growing up on the holidays for family who didn't like turkey or ham. It's become a staple in my holiday dinners as well. I have never served it to someone who didn't love it and beg for the family recipe after. We always make two and freeze one for later! It is excellent paired with a side of grilled asparagus.\"",

Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, and sage, then blend until smooth. Spread salmon over the pie crust. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese then pour the egg mixture on top. Top with the remaining 1/4 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.",
