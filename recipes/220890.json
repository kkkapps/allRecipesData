    "des": "\"Here's a quick and delicious way to use up those leftover mashed potatoes. You WILL need a waffle iron. These are basically potato pancakes (a.k.a. latkes) but without all the greasy clean-up and calories from pan-frying. I usually serve them with fish or chicken and sauteed apples.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.\nCook and stir onion and garlic in the melted butter until onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPreheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.\nCombine onion mixture, mashed potatoes, flour, eggs, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until well blended.\nScoop 1/4 to 1/2 cup batter (depending on size of waffle iron) into the center of waffle iron and close lid. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.",
