    "ins": "Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water.\nIn a large bowl, slowly pour hot milk into the eggs, whisking constantly. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar and salt. Mix in 1/2 cup melted butter. When mixture is room temperature, pour in the dissolved yeast. Add the flour and mix well.\nTurn dough out on floured board. Knead until smooth, about 10 to 15 minutes. Place in greased bowl, and cover. Let rise in warm place until double in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch dough down. Turn over, and let rise again for 45 minutes.\nIn a small bowl, combine 1 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon. Form dough into walnut-sized balls. Dip each ball in melted butter and roll it in cinnamon sugar. Pile loosely into a 10-inch Bundt pan.
