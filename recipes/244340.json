    "ins": "Place the meat into a slow cooker with enough water just to cover the top. Cook on med/low for 6 hours (or high for 4 hours). (You can also cook it on a low oven temp., the same way, if you prefer.)\nShred the meat gently with a fork and fill up your rolls.\nTop them with cheese and some oregano (or any spices you like). Bake them on a sheet pan with a sprinkling of spices, at 350 degrees just until the cheese is melted and the subs are warmed through, about 10 minutes. Serve them up nice and warm.",
