    "ins": "Stir quinoa and chicken broth together in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the quinoa has absorbed the chicken broth, about 15 minutes.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir the chicken breast pieces in the hot oil until no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes. Stir asparagus and red bell pepper into the skillet and cook and stir until barely tender, about 3 more minutes.\nLightly mix cooked quinoa into the chicken and vegetables until thoroughly combined, heat for 1 to 2 minutes, and serve.",
