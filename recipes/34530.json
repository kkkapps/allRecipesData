    "ins": "Combine 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning, garlic salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Sprinkle over the meaty side of the ribs, and rub into the meat. Let stand while making the dressing.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, combine bread cubes, celery, onion, garlic powder, salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning. Mix well with your hands. Pour the broth evenly over the mixture  to dampen all of the stuffing.  Lay one rack of the ribs on the counter, meaty side down. Top with the stuffing; pile it up! Top with the second rack of ribs, meaty side up. Wrap and tie with thread or string in about 3 places to keep them together. Transfer to a rack in a roasting pan.\nCover, and bake for 1 hour in preheated oven.  Remove the cover, and bake an additional 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
