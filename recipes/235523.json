    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCut the top off the bread loaf, keeping in one piece, and reserve for later use. Hollow out the loaf to form an area for the filling. Chop the removed bread for dipping.\nMix Cheddar cheese, ham, sour cream, cream cheese, green onions, green chile peppers, and jalapeno peppers in a bowl; spoon into the hollowed bread loaf. Return the top to the bread and wrap loaf with 2 pieces aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until filling is cooked through and bubbling, about 1 hour 20 minutes.",
