    "des": "\"One of my 'Israeli' recipes that I've adapted for whole rice (that in my opinion needs more seasoning). Good as a whole meal or as a side dish. Freezes fairly well, too.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion has softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ginger and stir until fragrant, 1 minute. Add brown rice and stir to coat rice with oil.\nStir lentils, cumin, salt, black pepper, and cinnamon into rice mixture; cover with water. Place lid on pot and simmer over low heat until lentils are tender and rice has absorbed the water, about 45 minutes.",
