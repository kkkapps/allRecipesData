    "des": "\"This is a delicious and easy dessert to make, short in ingredients and time. This is also a no-bake dessert, which makes it a summertime favorite! Looks beautiful in a trifle bowl. Great as a birthday or holiday \ndessert. Depending on how many people you are serving it usually does not last more than 1 day in my house! This can also be easily modified with other fresh fruits, but strawberry is our favorite! Pound cake cake work in place of angel food. Enjoy!\"",
