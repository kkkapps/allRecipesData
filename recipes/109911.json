    "des": "\"Pieces of lamb tenderloin are marinated in garlic, oil, and sherry vinegar, then threaded on rosemary skewers and grilled. A creamy salsa verde of Greek yogurt, fresh mint, oregano, and parsley complement these skewers nicely!\"",
    "ins": "Soak the rosemary skewers in water for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, whisk together the garlic, thyme, olive oil, sherry vinegar, salt, and pepper in a glass bowl.  Toss the lamb pieces in the marinade, and allow to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.  After the lamb has marinated, thread onto the rosemary sprigs.\nWhile the lamb is marinating, prepare the salsa verde by placing the lemon juice, olive oil, yogurt, garlic, salt, mint, oregano, parsley, capers, and anchovy filet into the bowl of a blender.  Blend until smooth, then pour into a serving dish and set aside.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.\nCook the lamb skewers, turning occasionally, until no longer pink, about 8 minutes.  Serve with salsa verde.",
