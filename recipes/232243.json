    "des": "\"Stir-fry combines tender strips of chicken with vegetables and popular ramen noodles. This version has more veggies and flavor. As is the case for any stir-frying recipe, have all of the ingredients prepped; have all of the veggies and meats cut up and ready to be added in the order called for in the recipe. Same goes for the liquids and the seasonings; have them already measured and set aside and ready to go. Always stir-fry over high heat so to keep everything crisp, tender, and not mushy.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add ramen noodles, reserving seasoning packet for later use. Cook noodles at a boil for 2 minutes; drain and set aside.\nHeat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken in skillet until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet with a slotted spoon to a bowl, reserving drippings in the skillet. Place a plate over the bowl to keep chicken warm.\nIncrease heat under the skillet to high. Cook and stir broccoli, onion, and garlic in the skillet until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix drained noodles, reserved seasoning from the ramen noodle package, bean sprouts, water, water chestnuts, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and chile-garlic sauce into the broccoli mixture; cook and stir until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomato wedges; cook until tomatoes are warm, 2 to 3 minutes.",
