    "des": "\"Actually any berry will work in this recipe (even frozen, if you must), but the dark, sweet blackberries are my favorite. Served barely warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it just doesn't get much better than this.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking dish.\nPlace berries in large bowl. Pour in lemon juice; sprinkle sugar evenly over berries. Gently stir to combine. Transfer to prepared baking dish. Gently pat down berries with the back of a spoon and level the surface.\nPlace rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix together with a fork until mixture is blended and crumbly, about 1 minute.\nDistribute crisp mixture over the top of the berries and smooth out with a tip of a fork so all berries are covered.\nBake in preheated oven until dark and berries are bubbling, about 45 minutes. Allow crisp to cool somewhat and firm up. Serve warm.",
