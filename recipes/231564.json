    "des": "\"This is by far the easiest chicken pot pie recipe you will find. The fantastic thing about this is you can make it for about 5 or 6 dollars if you know where to shop. It's fast, easy, and cost-effective. Fantastic recipe for students. To save dishes, I mix it right in the pie plate.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCombine mixed vegetables, potatoes, cream of chicken soup, and chicken chunks in a 9-inch pie dish. Add more soup if needed to coat the ingredients. Unroll crescent rolls and lay the sheet of dough onto the pie dish. Gaps are okay because they allow for ventilation. Press dough to pie plate to seal.\nBake in the preheated oven until crescent roll dough is golden brown and filling is bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before serving.",
