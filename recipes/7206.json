    "ins": "In a large bowl mix together the buttermilk, oil, and mayonnaise. Gradually stir in the flour and mix until all ingredients are combined.\nTurn dough out onto a well floured surface. If dough is sticky knead in a little extra flour. Pat the dough out to about a 1/2-inch thickness. Use a biscuit cutter to cut dough into pieces. Place into an oiled cast iron skillet. Allow biscuits to rest in the pan for 10 minutes.\nBake in a preheated 425 degree F (220 degrees C) until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.",
