    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a small saucepan, stir together anise seeds and mint. Stir in 1 cup water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil 5 minutes, then stir in honey. Continue to boil until most of the water has boiled off. Remove from heat, and stir in remaining 1/4 cup water.\nPlace lemon strips in a bowl, and pour melted butter over the strips. Let sit 5 minutes.\nPlace salmon on baking sheet. Brush thoroughly with anise sauce.\nPlace in a preheated oven, and bake until done, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and brush liberally with lemon butter.",
