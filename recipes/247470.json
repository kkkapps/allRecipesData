    "des": "\"Chicago-based filmmakers Matt Wechsler and Annie Speicher lead a busy life, especially with two small children to feed. Their meal plan frequently includes dishes made with good-for-the-planet ingredients. Oats are an essential rotation crop, delivering nutrients into the soil. So, they created a twist on the classic Italian preparation, swapping out rice for oats. This is best served with a hearty protein (beef, pork, lamb, goat, or chicken) and sauteed seasonal vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Heat chicken stock in a small saucepan over medium heat until simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.\nMeasure out 2 tablespoons spring onion tops and reserve.\nHeat 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat until melted. Add remaining spring onions to the skillet; cook and stir until wilted, about 1 minute. Add spring garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.\nStir oats into the skillet for 30 seconds. Add 2 tablespoons butter; cook and stir until oats are toasted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in wine; cook and stir until wine has evaporated, about 3 minutes.\nLadle enough chicken stock into the skillet to cover oats; cook, stirring often, until stock is nearly absorbed, about 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining stock, stirring often until each addition is nearly absorbed before adding more, until oats are tender and creamy, about 24 minutes. Stir in reserved spring onion tops and cook, about 1 minute.\nReduce heat to low. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese until melted, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.",
