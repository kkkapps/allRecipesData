    "des": "\"This is the traditional biscuit of the ham-loving South. In days gone by, these were made by beating the dough until it blistered (about 15-30 minutes). It was then baked, and each biscuit sliced in half to receive a paper-thin slice of incredible salt cured ham. Today, you could use the food processor or a biscuit brake (usually nothing more than a converted washing wringer) to make the dough \"snap.\"\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nSift flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar together.  Use a fork to \"cut\" the lard into the flour until it looks like coarse meal.  Using a standing mixer, or a wooden spoon, mix the dough as you slowly add the cream.  Mix well to form the dough into a ball, adding water if needed.\nPlace the dough onto a tabletop, and knead slightly.  With a mallet or a one-piece rolling pin, beat the dough a few times to form it into a rough rectangle.  Fold the dough over, and then beat it out again. Repeat this process until the dough becomes white and blisters form on the surface, about 15 minutes.\nRoll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into 2 inch rounds, and prick the top a few times with the tines of a fork.  Place on greased baking sheets.\nBake for 15 minutes, or until golden.",
