In a third medium bowl, combine the remaining flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt and ground black pepper.\nFirst coat the steak in the unseasoned flour, then dip in the milk mixture, and finally coat meat in the seasoned flour. Repeat as necessary if there's more than one piece of meat.\nHeat the oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Fry the coated meat in the oil for 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Drain meat on paper towels. (Note: Make sure the oil is fully heated before deep frying.)",
