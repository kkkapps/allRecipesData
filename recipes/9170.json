    "ins": "In a skillet, saute the celery with the onions until the onions are translucent.\nIn a large bowl combine the crumbled cornbread, cooked celery, cooked onions, giblets, oysters, parley, basil, salt, paprika, dried sage and nutmeg. Toss well.\nBeat the 2 eggs. Add the eggs and chicken stock to the stuffing mixture. Stuff stuffing in bird's cavity. Remove stuffing promptly once bird is cooked.
