    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nHeat the corn oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble in the chorizo sausage; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan, and set aside. Place slices of cheese in a single layer to cover the bottom of the pan. It is okay if they overlap a little bit. When cheese melts, quickly pour into a nice casserole dish, or oven-proof bowl. Sprinkle the chorizo on top.\nBake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is fully melted. Remove from the oven, stick a fork in it and load your tortilla.",
