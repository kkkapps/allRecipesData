    "des": "\"If you've ever picked or bought an ulu, thinking you were going to bake, make chips etc., and the next day it's practically mush, then this is the perfect recipe to try. Or if you've been forced to eat raw ripe ulu, and have developed a complex around the mushy state of this food, this recipe should turn your ulu distaste into yummy breakfast wonder. Enjoy with maple syrup, honey, or whatever!\"",
    "ins": "Scoop out ulu flesh into a blender. Add eggs, milk, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Blend batter until smooth.\nHeat coconut oil in a griddle over medium heat. Pour up to 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle; reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until edges are set, about 3 minutes. Turn over and cook until pancake is browned on the other side, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
