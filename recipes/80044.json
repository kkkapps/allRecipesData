    "des": "\"To avoid midmorning hunger, I eat smart but well at breakfast. Like grits. Often cooks will enliven this hot cereal with lots of cheddar cheese and bacon as a side dish. I substitute leaner Parmesan and prosciutto to get big taste for fewer calories.\"",
    "ins": "Microwave water until very hot, 3 to 4 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add prosciutto; saute until moisture evaporates and bits start to fry and crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove prosciutto; set aside.\nAdd the hot water to the empty pan and bring to a boil. Whisk in grits and salt. Simmer, uncovered, over medium-low heat until thick, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in prosciutto, cheese, butter and pepper to taste. Let stand to cool and allow flavors to blend, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve.",
