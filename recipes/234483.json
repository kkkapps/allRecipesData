    "des": "\"My husband and I came up with this recipe the other night since we were having a pumpkin carving party (making the pie for guests) and we also had our Halloween candy out. The pie was a big success. Our daughter's name is Teresa and we nickname her Resa (hence the name of the recipe)\n.\"",

Beat eggs together in a large bowl; stir in pumpkin and sugar mixture until just combined. Slowly pour evaporated milk into pumpkin mixture and stir until combined.\nArrange peanut butter cups, up-side down, into the graham cracker crust. Pour pumpkin mixture over peanut butter cups in pie crust.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted in the center of the pie comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
