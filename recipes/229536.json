    "des": "\"This roast turkey is filled with a flavorful stuffing of bacon, Dijon mustard, apricots, onions, and breadcrumbs and roasted with root vegetables, celery, and zucchini. It's an elegant and satisfying meal for Thanksgiving, or any special occasion.\"",
    "ins": "First make the stuffing. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan and fry bacon. Add remaining oil to pan and gently fry onion over low heat to soften, but not brown. Place breadcrumbs in a bowl and add bacon and onion, apricots and parsley. Season well.\nUsing pastry brush, paint Maille(R) Honey Dijon mustard over turkey. Place lemon and onion in turkey cavity and season. Spoon stuffing into neck end, pressing in tightly. Secure neck flap underneath. Lightly cover with foil. Place in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees F and roast for 3 1/2 hours, basting every hour and replacing foil. Test for thorough cooking by piercing the thick part of the thigh with a skewer. The juices should run clear with no pink tinge.\nPlace vegetables in a roasting tin, drizzle with olive oil and season. Place in oven 35 minutes before the end of roasting time. Turn occasionally.",
