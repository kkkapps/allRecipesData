    "des": "\"The most simple yet one of the best soups I had so far. A simplified version of my mum's cucumber soup. No need for salt, pepper, or seasonings, just a good vegetable broth. I like to have it with a good slice of toasted bread and some good cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter with the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in the butter mixture until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cucumber and zucchini slices; cook and stir until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour vegetable broth over the mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and let simmer until the vegetables are cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and cool a few minutes.\nPour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place with a towel; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.",
