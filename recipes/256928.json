Pour in olive oil slowly, whisking constantly, until dressing is thick and smooth. Stir in shallots, parsley, and thyme.\nToss tomato with 1 tablespoon of the dressing and 1 teaspoon of the chives. Spoon tomato into the ring molds. Repeat with avocado, cucumber, hearts of palm, artichoke hearts, and crabmeat, pressing each layer down with the back of a spoon.\nRemove ring molds carefully; drizzle remaining dressing over watercress.",
