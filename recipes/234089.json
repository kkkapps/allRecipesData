Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until cabbage is very tender, about 3 hours, adding more water as needed.\nWhisk remaining 1/4 cup water and flour together in a small bowl and gradually add to cabbage mixture. Continue to simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.",
