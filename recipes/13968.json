    "des": "\"This is a beautiful and flavorful salad with a fresh ginger dressing. The cap of the shiitake mushroom has a meaty flesh with a lot of flavor; reserve the tough stems for stocks. White or cremini mushrooms can be substituted. These are less expensive, but not as flavorful.\"",
    "ins": "Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water. Meanwhile, clean, stem, and slice mushrooms. Add mushrooms and red bell pepper during last 2 minutes of cooking. Drain.\nIn a small bowl, mix together vinegar, soy sauce, oil, and ginger.\nTransfer pasta, mushrooms, and pepper to a serving bowl; toss with ginger dressing. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.",
