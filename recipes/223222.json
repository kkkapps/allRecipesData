    "des": "\"I used vegetables from the farmers market and just started creating this delicious and spicy stew! It's very easy to put together and very tasty! If you like fresh garlic you can add 2 cloves to meat while browning. For a less-spicy option, remove jalapeno seeds.\"",
    "ins": "Crumble ground beef into a skillet over medium heat; season with garlic salt and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir the ground beef until completely browned, breaking into small pieces as you stir, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain as much grease from the beef as possible.\nCombine water, beef broth, corn, potatoes, sliced jalapeno peppers, onion, onion powder, and black pepper in a slow cooker; add drained ground beef. Cook on High until potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, 3 1/2 to 4 hours.",
