    "des": "\"I actually came up with this standing in the kitchen, deciding on what to eat. It was phenomenal! I paired mine with bacon-seared corn and brown rice. If you need a sauce for dipping, try a sweeter sauce (caramel-infused BBQ sauce comes to mind).\"",
    "ins": "Whisk egg, egg white, heavy cream, and garlic salt together in a small bowl.\nCombine flour, cocoa powder, and cinnamon sugar in a separate small bowl.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace half of the chicken into the egg mixture; let sit for 2 minutes. Remove chicken from egg mixture and place in the flour mixture, turning to coat all sides. Place the coated chicken pieces onto a paper towel. Repeat dipping the the remaining chicken in the egg mixture and the flour mixture.\nGently place the first batch of coated chicken in the hot oil; fry until chicken is cooked through and floats to the top, about 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to a plate lined with fresh paper towels. Repeat frying with the second batch of chicken. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes before eating.",
