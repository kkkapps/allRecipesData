Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nPlace the marinated turkey drumsticks on the baking sheet, and season with salt.\nCover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove cover, and continue baking 1 hour, basting often with the remaining orange mixture, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).",
