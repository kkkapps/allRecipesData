    "ins": "Place lamb in a large pot, cover with water, and add salt. Bring liquid to a boil and skim off any fat that comes to the surface. Reduce heat and simmer on low heat, about 30 minutes.\nMix onion and half of the potatoes into lamb mixture; cook until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Break up potatoes using a wooden spoon to thicken the stew.\nStir remaining potatoes and carrots into the stew; simmer until potatoes are soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper; stir in parsley.",
