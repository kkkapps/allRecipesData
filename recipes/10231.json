    "des": "\"The dough for these cookies is what makes them exceptional. I always quadruple this recipe for the holidays.   Most popular fillings are peach, apricot, raspberry and date.  Use your imagination! This year I'm trying Michigan cherry preserves and cranberry marmalade. You better hide a few for Christmas day--- these are the ones that go first!\"",
    "ins": "Mix cream cheese and butter until smooth. Add flour slowly until well blended. Shape into a ball and chill overnight or for several hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Roll dough out 1/8 inch thick on a floured pastry board. Cut into 2 1/2 inch squares and place 1/2 tsp (approx) of jam or preserves.  Overlap opposite corners and pinch together. Place on ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool. Sprinkle lightly with confectioner's sugar.",
