Gradually stir whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup at a time, into banana-flour mixture until batter is well mixed. Fold almonds, teff, poppy seeds, chia seeds, and flax seeds into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.\nBake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.
