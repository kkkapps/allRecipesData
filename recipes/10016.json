(Set egg whites aside for filling.)  NOTE: If you don't want to use raw egg white in the filling, leave it out. Substitute 1 whole egg for the 2 egg yolks in the cookie recipe so you don't end up with leftover whites!!\nIn a separate bowl sift together 2 cups flour, 5 T cocoa, 1 t baking powder, 1/2 t salt, 1 t baking soda.  Add to other mixture alternately with milk, beating well. Add vanilla at the end.\nDrop by large spoonful on greased pan. Bake for 10-15 minutes.
