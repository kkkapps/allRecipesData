Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.\nCombine cooked rice with black beans and chili powder.  Cut the tops off of the peppers and remove the ribs and seeds.  Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the rice and bean mixture into the bottoms of the peppers.  Lay a slice of cheese on top and repeat 3 more times, ending with cheese on top.\nBake in preheated oven until peppers soften, about 45 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat tomato sauce in a small saucepan over low to medium heat.  Slice peppers in half, top with tomato sauce and serve.",
