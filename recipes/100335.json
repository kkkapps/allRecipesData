    "des": "\"Simple to make with only three ingredients with a variety of uses. Great to use over Bundt cake because it sets up nicely.  The extra sauce may be refrigerated and reheated to serve over ice cream or your favorite dessert.  I came up with this once when I didn't have any confectioner's sugar to make a glaze for a Bundt cake.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the sweetened condensed milk and  chocolate chips. Cook, stirring constantly, until the chips are melted and the mixture is smooth. Do not allow it to bubble. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla. Cool slightly before drizzling over a cake. If you want to make this ahead, it can be cooled and reheated in the microwave.",
