    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nArrange trout fillets in the baking dish. Mix white wine, Dijon mustard, garlic, lemon juice, dill, and lemon-pepper seasoning in a bowl; spread over the fillets, letting some run underneath the fish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fish is opaque and flakes easily, 10 to 15 minutes.",
