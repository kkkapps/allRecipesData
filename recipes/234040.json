    "des": "\"This is a recipe that my MIL gave me. It's French Canadian and called Pate Chinois, which translates to Chinese Pie. It's a little twist on shepherd's pie but it's simple, delicious and sticks to your ribs on a cold, wintry night! Leftovers (not typical in my house!) are even better as the flavors all blend nicely. Good comfort food!\"",
