The marshmallows will expand and may run over sides of dish so make sure you leave a little room for that. You may have some pudding left over. Just save it and eat it later.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour crushed graham crackers into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix butter and sugar into the graham crackers using your hands until crumbs are moist; press into the dish forming a crust.\nArrange marshmallows in the crust, leaving space between each marshmallow.\nWhisk milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until pudding thickens, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour pudding over marshmallows. Arrange banana slices and vanilla wafer cookies atop the pudding.\nBake in the preheated oven until marshmallows melt, 20 to 30 minutes. Drizzle with chocolate syrup.",
