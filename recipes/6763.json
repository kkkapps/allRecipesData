    "ins": "Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add honey, and stir well.  Mix in whole wheat flour, salt, and vegetable oil.  Work all-purpose flour in gradually.  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead for at least 10 to 15 minutes.  When dough is smooth and elastic, place it in a well oiled bowl.  Turn it several times in the bowl to coat the surface of the dough, and cover with a damp cloth.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.\nPunch down the dough.  Shape into two loaves, and place into two well greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.  Allow to rise until dough is 1 to 1 1/2 inches above pans.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes.",
