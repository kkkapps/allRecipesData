    "ins": "Whisk together the eggs and milk in a bowl until evenly blended. Mix in the zucchini, razor clams, onion, and garlic; set aside. Stir together the bread crumbs, flour, parsley, salt, and pepper in a separate large bowl. Pour the egg and vegetable mixture into the flour mixture and stir until well combined.\nHeat oil and butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Drop fritter batter by spoonfuls into the skillet in batches of 4. Cook until golden brown on the bottom; flip and cook until the other side is golden brown. Drain the fritters on a paper towel-lined plate.",
