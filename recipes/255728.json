Add 1 teaspoon spinach to the flattened patty and form patty around the spinach into a ball. Flatten the ball with the palms of your hands. Repeat using the remaining squash mixture and spinach creating 12 to 14 more spinach-stuffed patties.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook patties until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked patties to a plate and repeat with remaining oil and patties.",
