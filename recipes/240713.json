    "des": "\"This make-ahead casserole has the same appeal as traditional lasagne, but is much less fussy to make. Serve with a leafy green salad and garlic bread to feed a hungry crowd.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMeanwhile, crumble the beef into a large deep skillet or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook, stirring until browned. Stir in the sauce until combined; stir in the noodles.\nBlend the cottage cheese with the Parmesan cheese. Layer 1/2 of the noodle mixture into a 9 x 13-inch (3 L) casserole. Top with the cottage cheese mixture. Spread the remaining noodle mixture over top. (The casserole can be covered and reserved in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Add an extra 10 minutes to the initial baking time.)\nBake, covered, for 20 minutes; uncover and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake for 10 minutes or until cheese is bubbly.",
