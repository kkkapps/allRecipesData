    "des": "\"This marinade works well with beef, chicken, pork, and portobello mushrooms. I like to use sirloin tips or a flank steak sliced on the bias and cook it to medium-rare. The tea adds a touch of smoky flavor. I substitute orange juice if I don't have pineapple juice. I don't always add the sherry, but I use it when I have it.\"",
    "ins": "Pour boiling water over tea leaves in a mug and steep for 3 minutes; strain and discard tea leaves. Dissolve brown sugar into the tea and set aside to cool.\nCombine pineapple juice, tamari, canola oil, ginger, garlic, sherry, and honey in a jar; add tea mixture. Seal jar and shake until the oil emulsifies into the marinade.",
