    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the beef and onion for 5 to 10 minutes, or until meat is browned. Drain excess fat and place this mixture in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.\nLayer the green beans, carrots, corn and peas over the beef mixture. Place the cheese over the vegetables.\nPrepare the potatoes according to package directions, but add some extra milk or water to make it a little runny. Cover the entire casserole with the potatoes.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until potatoes get slightly crusty and the sides of the dish are bubbly.",
