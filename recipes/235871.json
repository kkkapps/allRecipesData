    "des": "\"Best beef stew I've ever made! I apologize for the vague instructions, the ingredient amounts are approximate as well as I did this over the weekend but did not note amounts. It turned out so good I wanted to save what I did so I could make again! Chicken broth can be used instead of beef broth if desired.\"",
