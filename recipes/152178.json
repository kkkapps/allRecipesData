I created my own version at home. Everyone loves it! You can use spinach leaves entirely if you prefer, or mix in any kind of greens you like.\"",

Stir in the poppy seeds; set aside.\nToss together the lettuce, spinach, and onion in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Add the strawberries and lightly toss again.
