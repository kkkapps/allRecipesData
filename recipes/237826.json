    "des": "\"The beauty of aioli made in the traditional method with a mortar and pestle is that a small amount of garlic can flavor a large amount of mayo. Also, this real aioli is so strong and powerful that you don't need half a cup of mayo on your grilled fish. Just a teaspoon of my version is so intense it will fully flavor a whole piece of meat or pile of veggies.\"",
    "ins": "Crush garlic and salt together in a mortar with a pestle; add tarragon and continue crushing with the pestle until tarragon is pulverized.\nStir mayonnaise and lemon juice into garlic-tarragon mixture until aioli is smooth; season with cayenne pepper.",
