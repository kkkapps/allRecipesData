    "ins": "Sprinkle salt and black pepper over chicken breast tenderloins.\nWhisk eggs in a shallow bowl until smooth. Place panko in a separate shallow bowl.\nDip both sides of each chicken breast in the eggs and then in the panko.\nHeat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook 1/3 of the breaded tenderloins until crusts are golden and centers are no longer pink, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining oil and breaded tenderloins in 2 batches.\nReturn all chicken to the skillet. Pour wing sauce over chicken. Sprinkle cheese on top. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.",
