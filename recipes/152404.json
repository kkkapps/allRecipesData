    "des": "\"Many years ago, while visiting a friend in Idaho, we decided to make chili and wandered into the grocery store with a vague idea of what chili was supposed to have in it.  Several slight adjustments later, this was the result and it has become a family standard.\"",
    "ins": "Sort and rinse beans, then place into a large pot along with the water, jalapeno peppers, garlic powder, cumin, and oregano. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beans are tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and stir in the ground beef and onion. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir the beef into the simmering beans along with the salt, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Return to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, and allow to stand for a few minutes before serving.",
