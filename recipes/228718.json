    "des": "\"We built this recipe from a lot of trial and error and a little experimentation with the wine selection. It has a sweet flavor with just a little zing to keep things interesting. Great for all types of italian dishes. We even used it for Italian sausage bombers.\"",

Add brown sugar, Italian seasoning, salt, oregano, basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until brown sugar dissolves and seasoning is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.\nStir tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and white wine into the seasoned onion mixture; bring to a boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes.",
