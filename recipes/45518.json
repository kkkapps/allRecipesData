    "des": "\"This recipe started as something I found off the back of a seaweed package, but has been adapted several times so that it can be made quickly with ingredients from most large grocery stores - or a local Asian grocery if you prefer. Nori is the Japanese word for dried sheets of seaweed.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the ground pork until browned. Drain off excess fat, and add water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.\nStir in the bouillon cube to dissolve, and add water chestnuts and nori. Stir in the egg, and season with salt. Remove from heat, and mix in the green onions and sesame oil. Serve immediately.",
