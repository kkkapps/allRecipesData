    "des": "\"Very sweet steamed pudding, more like a cake, that is typically served at holiday time. I cook this into my double boiler. Even though this cooks on simmer, it is wise to check that the pan does not boil dry! This is traditionally served with hard sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Grease the inside bowl of a double-boiler.\nMix flour, bread crumbs, water, molasses, figs, raisins, walnuts, orange peel, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg together in a bowl until batter is well incorporated; spoon batter into the prepared double-boiler bowl and cover.\nFill the bottom half of a double boiler with water and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer. Place bowl in the simmering water and cover. Steam until pudding is cooked through, adding water as needed, 3 hours. Cool slightly with cover ajar before serving warm.",
