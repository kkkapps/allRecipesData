    "des": "\"My friend's mom used to make 'garden' soup every Sunday. She would go through her fridge and any unused veggies would be thrown into the soup pot. This is my version; hearty, thick, and chock full of veggies. It is important to add the diced beets at the end to keep the colour appealing. My daughter goes crazy for this soup; it is very tasty and filling, best served warm.\"",
    "ins": "Place oxtail, onions, carrots, cabbage, celery, barley, onion soup mix, dill, cinnamon, bay leaf, and water in a large slow cooker. Cook on low until meat is tender, about 5 hours.\nRemove meat and bones from slow cooker; cool on a plate until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Cut meat into small pieces; return meat to the soup and discard bones. Skim off any fat from soup; remove bay leaf.\nStir beets and beet greens into soup; cook on low until beets are tender, about 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper; top each bowl with about 1 tablespoon sour cream to serve.",
