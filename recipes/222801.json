    "des": "\"SO easy and SO good! This is comfort food for me at it's finest, my all-recipe friends! Like pumpkin pie for breakfast, but you don't have to feel guilty for the rest of the day! Use any sweetener you want and adjust to taste. Enjoy!  I make up a big batch then reheat for the next mornings in the microwave covered. Vegan. I like to set it with a timer before I go to bed so it is ready in the morning.\"",
