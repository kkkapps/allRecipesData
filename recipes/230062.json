    "des": "\"I like to make this delicious apple crisp recipe in the fall using fresh Granny apples picked from our local orchard. For a Thanksgiving-like twist, top with a sweet cranberry compote.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSpread apples into a 9x9-inch baking dish. Mix brown sugar, flour, rolled oats, butter, cinnamon, and allspice together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle topping over apples.\nBake in the preheated oven until the crumble topping is browned and the apples are soft, 30 to 40 minutes.\nCombine cranberries, white sugar, and water in a saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring often, until cranberries pop, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; compote will thicken as it cools. Serve apple crisp topped with warm cranberry compote.",
