    "des": "\"This a great sandwich which is well known here in Chile. Creamy chicken with cooked bell pepper gives this sandwich a nice taste!! You can also make them with cocktail bread for a great appetizer! You can use up to double the mayonnaise for a creamier texture.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain, cool and chop.\nBring a small pot of water to a boil; add the bell pepper and cook until soft, about 10 minutes.\nCombine the bell pepper, chicken, cream, and mayonnaise in a food processor. Blend until mostly smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Spread about half of the mixture on each of two slices of bread and sandwich with the remaining bread.",
