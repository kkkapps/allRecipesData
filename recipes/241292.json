    "ins": "Season chicken breasts all over with salt and black pepper.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Pour salsa and chicken broth over chicken, bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn chicken over, stir salsa mixture, and continue to simmer until chicken is tender and sauce is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
