    "ins": "Use a chef's knife to slice cabbage into thin pieces 1 to 2 inches long.  Do not use the large ribs of the cabbage, as they are too strongly flavored.\nIn a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, apples, walnuts, celery, mayonnaise, sugar and salt until evenly coated.  Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to one day.",
