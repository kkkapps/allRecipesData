Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain macaroni and return to pot.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.\nStir tomato soup and tomato sauce into the beef; pour into pot with macaroni and stir. Transfer macaroni mixture to a 1.5-quart baking dish; top with Cheddar cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.",
