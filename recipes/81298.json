    "des": "\"My girlfriend brought these granola bars over for a playgroup one morning and ever since they've been a staple!  My son requests them almost daily so I usually triple the recipe and make 2 trays so we have plenty on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the oats, brown sugar, wheat germ, cinnamon, flour, raisins and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in the honey, egg, oil and vanilla. Mix well using your hands. Pat the mixture evenly into the prepared pan.\nBake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bars begin to turn golden at the edges. Cool for 5 minutes, then cut into bars while still warm. Do not allow the bars to cool completely before cutting, or they will be too hard to cut.",
