    "ins": "In a large soup pot over medium heat, cook and stir the ground chuck and ground pork until the meat is browned, about 15 minutes, breaking the meat into crumbles as it cooks. Drain off the excess grease, reserving about 1/2 cup of drippings, and cook and stir the onion and garlic until they begin to brown, about 10 minutes.\nStir in the stout beer, tomato paste, water, beef stock, chili powder, cumin, Mexican oregano, smoked paprika, coriander seed, cocoa powder, chipotle-flavored hot sauce, cornmeal, and flour until thoroughly combined, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 8 hours.",
