    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch springform pan. Sprinkle sugar in the pan to coat. Whisk together 2 cups of flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in a bowl.\nBeat 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Spread into prepared pan.\nTop the cake with the sliced apples, arranged in an overlapping spiral pattern. In a small bowl, blend 2 tablespoons flour, brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and butter with fork until crumbly. Sprinkle over the apples.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
