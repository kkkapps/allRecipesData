Form into 4 patties and place between sheets of waxed paper or plastic wrap. Place into an airtight container and refrigerate overnight for best results.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nCook the patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. Serve on toasted buns with condiments of your choice.",
