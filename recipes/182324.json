    "ins": "Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; stir in the green beans and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the green beans until just tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.\nHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, 1 clove of garlic, and parsley in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, wine vinegar, and cumin; bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes to thicken the sauce. Transfer the sauce to a bowl.\nIn a clean skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat; cook and stir 1 clove of chopped garlic in the hot oil until fragrant beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the cooked green beans to the skillet; cook and stir to reheat the beans and coat them with oil. Pour the sauce over the beans and stir to coat. Serve hot.",
