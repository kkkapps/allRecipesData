    "des": "\"This is just like the steak spice you find in the Montreal delis in Canada. It is bold and spicy and good on so much more than just steak. Grinding the spice mixture at home only takes a couple of minutes and provides the freshest flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Place white peppercorns into a mini food processor or spice grinder; pulse several times. Add coriander seed, dill seed, mustard seed, and red pepper flakes to food processor; pulse until seeds are broken into a coarse mixture.\nTransfer spice mixture to a small bowl; stir in garlic and kosher salt. Store mixture in an airtight glass container; shake before using.",
