    "des": "\"This recipe is addictive and very easy. It tastes like the top crunchy part of cobbler desserts. It would be good as a cereal with milk or to put in yogurt or topped on fruit that has been fried in a little butter and brown sugar. A dollop of homemade whipped cream wouldn't hurt the latter!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray or line with non-stick aluminum foil.\nWhisk maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, rose water, and salt together in a bowl.\nMix oats, rice cereal, coconut, cashews, raisins, dried blueberries, pecans, almonds, dried cranberries, and brown sugar together in a separate bowl. Pour maple syrup mixture over oat mixture and stir until evenly coated. Spread oat mixture onto the prepared baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; stir and continue baking until slightly crisp and lightly browned, 15 to 25 more minutes. Cool on baking sheets before serving, about 1 hour. Store in air-tight containers.",
