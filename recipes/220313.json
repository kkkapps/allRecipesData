    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nGrease a baking sheet.\nPlace chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a uniform thickness of 1 inch.\nHeat spinach in a saucepan over medium-high heat.\nWhisk eggs, Parmesan cheese, and milk together in a bowl.\nStir egg mixture into the spinach; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nSpread about 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of the spinach mixture onto each pounded chicken breast.\nRoll each breast into a cylinder shape, secure ends with toothpicks, and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.\nSprinkle bread crumbs atop rolled chicken.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. Allow chicken to rest for several minutes before removing toothpicks and serving.",
