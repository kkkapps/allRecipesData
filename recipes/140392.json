Add chops, and cook about 5 minutes, turning once, or until meat surface is browned. Remove chops from pan and set aside on a separate plate.\nAdd onions, apples, and  mushrooms to skillet, cooking just until soft. Add thyme, salt, pepper, and apple brandy; stir to blend. Return chops to skillet and surround with onion mixture. Over medium heat, simmer uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Mix in cream and simmer until sauce thickens, about 10 minutes longer.
