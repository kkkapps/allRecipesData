    "des": "\"Usually making something like fresh cheese at home is done because it's higher quality, and much cheaper. This recipe for fromage blanc, or farmer's cheese, flies in the face of that conventional culinary wisdom. So why bother? Because, for any self-respecting foodie, making a batch of homemade cheese is definitely on the culinary 'bucket list.' Before you cash in your apron for good, you should experience the magic of watching a pot of milk turned into cheese. And if all this sounds kind of cheesy, so be it.\"",
    "ins": "Heat milk in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat, stirring regularly, to 175 degrees F (79 degrees C). Pour buttermilk and lemon juice into milk and remove from heat. Stir gently with a wooden spoon; the curds and whey will begin to separate. If mixture does not curdle, add another teaspoon of lemon juice. Let milk mixture sit for 10 minutes.\nPlace a colander over a stockpot and line the colander with 4 layers of cheesecloth. Ladle cheese curds into prepared colander. Let drain for 5 minutes.\nGather the cheesecloth and tie at the top with twine or string. Tie cheesecloth bag to a wooden spoon and hang it over the stockpot. Let drain for 30 minutes.\nCut off tied top of cheesecloth. Unwrap the drained cheese and turn out into a bowl. Mix salt into cheese with a wooden spoon. Transfer cheese to a ramekin, cover ramekin with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.",
