    "ins": "Use a juicer to process the tomatoes, celery, onion, green pepper, beets, carrots, and garlic. Place all of the juice into a large pot. Stir in the sugar, black pepper, horseradish, lemon juice, and enough water to make a thin consistency. Season with Worcestershire sauce to taste. Bring to a boil, and continue boiling for 20 minutes.\nLadle into 1 quart jars leaving 3/4 inch of headspace. Stir 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt into each jar. Wipe rims clean, and place lids and rings onto jars. Process in a pressure canner for 35 minutes at 10 pounds of pressure.",
