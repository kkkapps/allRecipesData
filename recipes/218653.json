    "des": "\"A caramel-nougat candy bar stuffed into bananas, wrapped in foil and roasted in the coals for a super rich camping treat! These are really rich and a fun treat for camping that's different than S'mores.\"",
    "ins": "With a sharp knife, cut a lengthwise wedge out of each banana, slicing through the peel and almost through the banana. Carefully remove the wedge and set aside. Slice each candy bar into 3 slices the long way. Insert a slice of candy bar into the banana, then replace the wedge back over the candy, pushing the wedge back down. Repeat with remaining bananas; wrap the stuffed bananas tightly in aluminum foil.\nRoast the bananas in the coals of a campfire until the fruit is hot and the candy has melted, about 5 minutes. Unwrap the bananas, then remove peel from wedges and eat the bananas with spoons. Candy filling could be very hot, so use caution.",
