    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nMix strawberry cake mix, water, eggs, and oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase speed to medium and mix batter for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, 24 to 27 minutes.\nPoke holes all over the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon. Pour sweetened condensed milk over cake, letting it seep into the holes. Cool cake to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nPour thawed strawberries over cake, letting juices seep into the holes. Cover cake with whipped topping. Refrigerate.",
