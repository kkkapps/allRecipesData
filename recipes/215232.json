    "des": "\"A versatile side or main course, black bean soup is a classic dish from Cuba that is enjoyed throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Black bean soup recipes allow for great versatility as a soup that stands alone or poured over rice for an elegant and unexpectedly flavorful main course. Our GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Cuban Black Bean Soup packs a delicious, seasoned bite that won't overwhelm the satisfying texture of our naturally low-fat beans.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cumin, garlic, oregano and Sazon to pot. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine; bring to a boil. Add 1 cup water, beans, bay leaves, brown sugar and vinegar; bring bean mixture to a boil. Reduce to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens and ingredients come together, about 15 minutes. Season soup with Adobo; discard bay leaf.\nDivide soup evenly among serving bowls. Garnish with onions and cilantro, if desired.",
