    "ins": "In a small bowl, mix tuna, chili sauce and green onions. Blend in enough water to allow easy spreading.\nLay tortillas one by one on a flat surface. Spread a thin layer of cheese onto each tortilla, covering the entire surface. Spread tuna mixture over cheese to within an inch of tortilla edge.\nStarting at the top, roll up the tortilla into a snug cylindrical shape, ensuring the cream cheese seals the bottom.\nEnclose roll-ups in aluminum foil, and refrigerate or freeze until serving. When ready to serve, cut the roll-ups into 2 inch slices. If frozen, slice the roll-ups about 15 minutes before serving time to allow them to defrost completely.",
