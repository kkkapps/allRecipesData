    "des": "\"I call this diet haters' diet food because simple substitutions mean you won't feel deprived.  You shouldn't miss the tortilla chips because you have delicious black beans instead, and you still get the yummy spicy Mexican flavor and cheese. While not necessarily authentic, this salad is easy to make!  If you have time, it's is also wonderful topped with onions and maybe fresh jalapenos.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.\nPlace the chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Mix the tomato sauce, water and taco seasoning in a small bowl; pour sauce over the chicken.\nBake in preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.\nDivide spinach between two plates. Place the chicken breasts on the spinach beds and spoon half the black beans over each piece. Divide sour cream, shredded cheese and salsa to top each salad.",
