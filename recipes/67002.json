    "ins": "Combine brown sugar, lemon juice, molasses, basil, vegetable oil, mustard, honey, clove, ranch dressing, chili powder, and garlic in a large bowl.  Toss in shrimp to coat, cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.  Meanwhile, soak wooden skewers in hot water to prevent burning on the grill.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.\nThread shrimp tightly on to skewers.  Cook on the top rack of the grill for approximately 4 minutes, or until the shrimp turns pink on one side.  Flip shrimp and cook for an additional 2 to 4 minutes, or until there are no signs of grey.  Use a fork to remove shrimp from the skewers.",
