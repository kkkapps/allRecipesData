    "ins": "Prepare a slow cooker crock with cooking spray.\nSpread celery, carrots, onion, and garlic in the bottom of the crock. Season short ribs with salt and pepper; place atop the vegetables. Pour beef consomme and water into the crock.\nCook on High until the ribs are fork-tender, 5 to 7 hours.\nRemove the ribs from the slow cooker to a platter. Strain the broth and discard the vegetables.\nStrip meat from the bones of the ribs. Discard bones and transfer meat to a bowl. Shred meat with 2 forks and serve with strained broth.",
