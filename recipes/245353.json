    "des": "\"Inspired by a recipe I found on Allrecipes.com, I created this spaghetti squash Pad Thai recipe using my favorite ingredients. It takes less than 30 minutes of active prep time.\"",
    "ins": "Drain tofu and slice horizontally into 1/4-inch slices. Lay paper towels on a cutting board, place tofu slices on top, and cover with another layer of paper towels. Place something heavy, such as a cast iron skillet, on top. Allow to drain for 1 to 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash, cut-side up, on a baking sheet.\nBake spaghetti squash in preheated oven until tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove squash from oven; remove and separate strands from peel using a fork.\nHeat 2 tablespoons sesame oil in wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add eggs, cook and stir until eggs are cooked through and scrambles, about 5 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate.\nCut each slice of tofu into 9 triangles and place in a bowl; add cornstarch and toss to coat. Shake tofu to remove excess cornstarch.\nHeat remaining 4 tablespoons sesame oil in wok over medium-high heat; add tofu and saute until crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove from wok. Place squash, bean sprouts, Pad Thai sauce, garlic chile paste, and onions into wok and saute until heated through, about 10 minutes. Mix tofu and scrambled eggs into squash mixture. Remove wok from heat, add cashews, and toss to combine.",
