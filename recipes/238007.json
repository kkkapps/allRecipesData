    "des": "\"This is a very smooth and pleasing cheese soup. It is made with American cheese instead of Cheddar, and my children love it! It also makes a great base for broccoli-cheese soup, if you are so inclined.\"",
    "ins": "Stir chicken broth, carrot, celery, and onion together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 6 to 8 minutes.\nWhisk milk, flour, and pepper together in a small bowl; stream into the broth mixture while stirring. Cook until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes.\nStir American cheese into the liquid; cook and stir until melted smoothly into the mixture, 2 to 3 minutes.",
