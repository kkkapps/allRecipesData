Transfer oats to a large bowl and stir in flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\nBeat butter, milk, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in another bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract with the last egg; stir in oat mixture until well blended. Fold in peanut butter chips, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDrop 1-inch spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until cookie centers are set, 10 to 12 minutes.",
