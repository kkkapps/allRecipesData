    "des": "\"A great alternative for anyone watching their sugar intake but craving some chewy gummy candies! The best part is the flavor possibilities are limitless! Yum! I make these in gummy bear molds, but they can be made using any kind of candy mold. They can be stored at room temperature, but they retain a better gummy texture when stored in the fridge.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a saucepan almost halfway with water; bring to a boil.\nMeasure 1/3 cup cold water in a glass measuring cup. Dissolve gelatin in the cold water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Stir in stevia powder and soft drink mix.\nPlace measuring cup in the boiling water. Stir gelatin mixture until syrupy.\nPlace candy molds on a baking sheet. Remove gelatin mixture from boiling water and immediately fill molds using a small syringe.\nChill gelatin mixture until set, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. Remove from molds.",
