    "des": "\"A very sweet tasting cookie. That's how it got its name.  Four dozen may seem like a lot, but after one taste, four dozen will seem like one dozen!  The original recipe had both white and regular chocolate in it.  Kids of all ages will love them.    I'm 11 years old.  I invented this recipe myself.\"",
