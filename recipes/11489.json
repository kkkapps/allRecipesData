    "des": "\"This is my favorite cookie of all the ones my Nana made and taught me to make for the family. In her memory I share this recipe with you. My Grandmother Nancy (Saccuzzo) Gama made these for me every year until her death. Now, I make them in honor of her every year. You will enjoy these. Serve with wine or your favorite ice cream. They are also a great accent to a good cup of coffee.\"",
