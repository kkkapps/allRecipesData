Remove the cinnamon packet from the mix and reserve 1/3 cup for later.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the cake mix, the rest of the packet of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and black pepper. Mix in the egg and shortening until a dough forms. Form dough into 1 inch balls, roll the balls in the reserved cinnamon packet and place them 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops are cracked and puffy. Let cookies set on cookie sheets until completely cool.",
