    "des": "\"I tried 'Chicken Charlie's Deep Fried Kool-Aid\u00c2\u00ae' at the San Diego County Fair. They were very good so I started to search on a way to recreate them. I searched for drop doughnut recipes and took one of those and adapted it.  This is a very close version of the one I had at the fair in looks and taste. The fair's version was cherry-flavored, but you could use any flavor you like.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Mix 3 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, the baking powder, salt, and 1/2 packet of the soft drink mix together in a large bowl.\nWhisk the milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate large bowl until blended; slowly stir in the flour mixture until entirely incorporated in a batter the consistency of a thick pancake batter.\nDrop the batter by large spoonfuls, about 2 teaspoons in size, into the preheated oil; fry until deep golden brown on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to drain on a platter lined with paper towels.\nMix together 1 cup sugar with the remaining 1/2 packet of soft drink mix in a flat-bottomed dish. Roll the drained donuts in the sugar mixture while still hot. Set aside on a fresh set of paper towels to cool slightly; serve warm.",
