Roll small balls of dough in hand, about 1 inch in diameter.  Place on greased cookie sheet, approximately 3/4 inch apart. Using a fork, make criss cross pattern on cookie  (this will flatten cookie partially). Be careful not to over flatten, dough should not touch each other.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 18 to 25 minutes.",
