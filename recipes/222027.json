Stir snap peas into onion mixture and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour chicken stock, Marsala wine, and white wine into skillet. Add penne pasta; cook and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.\nDivide pasta and snap pea mixture into 2 bowls and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese to serve.",
