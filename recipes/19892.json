    "des": "\"I found this recipe calling for only apples or peaches, but found it worked wonderfully with any fruit you have available.  Please experiment! If using primarily apples, try a bit of shredded cheddar cheese, sprinkled on top of crumble topping the last 10 minutes of baking.  Tastes wonderful with vanilla ice cream.\"",

Cut in butter with two knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sprinkle over fruit.\nBake in preheated oven 35 to 45 minutes, until topping starts to brown.  Serve warm.",
