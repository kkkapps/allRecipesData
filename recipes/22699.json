    "des": "\"I made these when I had my bar, and they were always a big hit. I made them in large batches because of the standing time, but have scaled the recipe for home use. Extra large eggs are boiled, then pickled in a simple brine solution. For a variation, add dry minced onion flakes, crushed red pepper or hot sauce to the brine.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix together the vinegar, water and pickling spice. Bring to a boil and mix in the garlic and bay leaf. Remove from heat.\nTransfer the eggs to sterile containers. Fill the containers with the hot vinegar mixture, seal and refrigerate 8 to 10 days before serving.",
