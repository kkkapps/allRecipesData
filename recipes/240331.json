You don't need all the extra ingredients to make it. Just basic ingredients. and it's delicious. I think it tastes just like Panera\u00c2\u00ae.\"",

Add chicken broth; season with salt and ground black pepper.\nReduce heat to medium-low and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes. Add broccoli, carrot, and celery. Simmer until vegetables are tender yet crisp, about 20 minutes.\nReduce heat to low. Add Cheddar cheese to soup and cook, stirring occasionally, until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.",
