    "des": "\"This recipe was given to me by a woman that makes savory tarts in a small town in the south of France. I found her crust and process to be the most delicious, simple and logical of all the crusts I've ever made.\"",
    "ins": "In a food processor, mix together flour and salt. Add butter, and process until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time. Pulse briefly until dough begins to form in clumps. Remove dough from processor onto a floured surface, and form into a ball. Allow dough to rest at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before rolling out.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to fit pie pan. Place in pan, and crimp edge. Prick the bottom of dough several times with a fork. Place in freezer for 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nFill crust with beans, or use pie weights. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove pie weights, and bake another 5 minutes. If necessary, cover with foil to prevent overbrowning.",
