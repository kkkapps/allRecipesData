    "des": "\"An ace curry--traditional, vegetarian, and tasty as all else! An indian dish, when I serve this up, my mates, family, or peers are quite chuffed and I'm always asked for the recipe. Any sort of rice can be used; I suggest cooking jasmine rice ahead of time and keeping it warm until curry is done, then serving it and pouring the chili over or next to it.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Add onion and curry paste; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in eggplant; cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes.\nPour coconut milk and vegetable stock onto the eggplant mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in sweet potato and lime leaves; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Mix in lime juice, lime zest, and brown sugar; stir until combined. Season with salt; garnish with shredded lime leaf and cilantro.",
