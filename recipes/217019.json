    "des": "\"Sesame and chili oils add rich flavor and a little kick to naturally sweet snap peas. This versatile side dish has an Asian feel to it, so goes well with Asian dishes.  Scale this recipe up or down easily for larger or smaller crowds.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the sesame oil and chili oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers with heat. Cook and stir the snap peas until they turn bright green and start to become tender, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper as they cook. Sprinkle peas with sesame seeds, and stir a few times to mix before serving.",
