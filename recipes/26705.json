    "des": "\"Ever since a family friend introduced us to this Italian dip, we have made it a tradition on New Year's Eve. You have to really like garlic to enjoy this. I have heard that some people omit the cream and substitute olive oil also. Serve with crusty Italian bread, raw cabbage wedges, lettuce, bread sticks or crackers.\"",

Remove from heat, cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 2 hours.\nReturn the mixture to medium heat, stirring occasionally, until bubbly. Serve hot.",
