    "des": "\"Skirt steak comes from the short plate.  It comes in a long, thin strip or 'skirt'. Sometimes it's hard to find, so if you don't see it out with the other meats, ask your butcher.\"",
    "ins": "Cut the skirt steak into individual strips for serving. Add the garlic to the teriyaki sauce. In a re-sealable plastic bag, combine the steak and the sauce. Seal tightly and refrigerate to marinate overnight.\nPreheat oven to broil OR preheat a barbecue grill.\nWhen oven OR grill is ready, remove meat from bag and discard remaining marinade. Place meat on a broiler pan for the oven OR directly on the grill for the barbecue. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.",
