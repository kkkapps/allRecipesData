    "des": "\"One of the great blessings, and curses, of Thanksgiving is leftover turkey. That's where this spicy Thai coconut soup recipe comes in. This is my take on Tom Kha Gai, and as usual I make no claim as to its authenticity. I do know it tastes amazing and will make you forget you even roasted a turkey. Garnish with chili oil, cilantro leaves, and lime wedges.\"",
    "ins": "Combine turkey broth, lemongrass, ginger, cilantro stems, lime leaves, and red pepper flakes in a pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until flavors blend, 20 to 30 minutes.\nStain broth mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, discard vegetables, and return broth to the pot.\nStir turkey, mushrooms, fish sauce, and palm sugar into broth; simmer until mushrooms are tender and turkey absorbs broth flavor, about 15 minutes.\nPour coconut milk, lime juice, green onions, and cilantro leaves into broth. Bring soup to a simmer and drizzle in chili oil.",
