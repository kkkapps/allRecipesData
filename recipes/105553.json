    "des": "\"I love Indian food, this recipe developed after falling in love with the dish at a small family owned Indian restaurant near my home. After tweaking a few things, I think I have come up with a great copy-cat version.  The curry paste can easily be substituted with the mild version for those with more sensitive palates.  Serve over Basmati rice. I hope it meets your liking.  Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Place half of the mango slices into the bowl of a blender with the coconut milk.  Blend until smooth and reserve for later.\nHeat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Stir in the curry paste, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the chicken and shallot; cook until the chicken is done and the shallots have softened, about 5 minutes.  Pour in the mango puree, and cook until heated through.  To serve, stir in the remaining mango slices and cucumber.",
