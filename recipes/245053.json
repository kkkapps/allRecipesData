Drizzle olive oil over garlic layer and top with parsley, zaatar, salt, and pepper. Gently roll fish to mix ingredients. Wrap foil around mixture and seal tightly.\nPlace foil packet on the edge of the direct heat zone on the preheated grill; cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
