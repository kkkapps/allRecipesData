    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nSprinkle pork chops with salt and black pepper, and grill until the chops are browned, show good grill marks, and are no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nPlace ham, tomato, and mozzarella cheese slices on each pork chop, and sprinkle with oregano and paprika; cook until the cheese has melted, about 2 more minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.",
