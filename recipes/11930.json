    "des": "\"Our family has been cooking this rigatoni for 40 years. It is a great change from the Friday night pizza, as it contains all of your favorite pizza toppings. This is a heavy recipe. A simple salad is all you need to make a complete meal.\"",
    "ins": "Cook rigatoni pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain well. Set aside.\nIn a large skillet, fry sausage until cooked through but not brown. Add chopped onions and minced garlic. Stir and cook until soft. Add sliced mushrooms and cook about 5 minutes. Add chopped green pepper and cook slowly until soft. Drain off any excess fat.\nStir in tomatoes with juice, tomato paste, fresh basil and pepperoni. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add cooked rigatoni noodles. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nSimmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has been cooked off.",
