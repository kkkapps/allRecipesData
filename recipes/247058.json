    "des": "\"Peaches are rich in vitamin C, vitamin A, and potassium, and their mild, sweet flavour makes them an ideal first fruit. Your baby will love this winning combo of egg, peaches and banana.\"",
    "ins": "Steam or boil diced peaches until very tender. Drain if necessary and mash or puree until you have your desired consistency. Let cool slightly then place in a sealed container in the fridge until ready to use.\nPlace your egg in a small pot and cover with cold water. The water should be about an inch or so higher than the egg. Cover the pot with a lid. Over high heat, bring your egg to a rolling boil.\nRemove from heat and let stand for 12 minutes.\nDrain water and immediately run cold water over egg until cooled. Rapid cooling helps prevent a green ring from forming around the yolks.\nPeel egg and place in a bowl. Mash very well.\nCombine egg with 1/4 cup (60 mL) pureed peaches and mashed banana. Mash together well until you have your desired consistency. Add a little breast milk or formula to thin if you like.",
