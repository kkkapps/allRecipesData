It's unique in the way it infuses the flavors of fresh garden cucumbers, the tangy brightness of fresh lemons, and the lightness of an effervescent lemon-lime soda to create a delicious thirst quenching southern summer ade. Perfect when relaxing on your front porch swing on a warm summer night.\"",
