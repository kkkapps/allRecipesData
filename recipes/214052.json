Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Drain. Cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel and chop the cooled eggs.\nCook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble once cool.\nCombine the eggs, bacon, mayonnaise, mozzarella cheese, paprika, sugar, white wine vinegar, and mustard in a bowl to make a chunky dip. Garnish with paprika.",
