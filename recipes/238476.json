    "des": "\"This is a great way to preserve apples, with a sweet, subtle brandy flavor to it. \n\nThey make an excellent pie filling! It should be enough to make three pies.\"",
    "ins": "Place apple rings in a bowl and pour in enough water to cover. Add lemon juice to water.\nBring sugar and 3 cups water to a boil in a large saucepan; cook and stir until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes. Add apples to sugar-water mixture and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until apples are tender, about 30 minutes.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack apple rings into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Keep syrup in the saucepan.\nBring the syrup back to a boil and add brandy; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle the syrup over apple rings, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top.\nRun a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.",
