    "ins": "Place the beef roast in a large slow cooker and cover with sliced onions, garlic, enchilada sauce, apple butter, cayenne sauce, and 1 teaspoon salt.\nPlace the lid on top and turn the slow cooker on high. Cook for 5-7 hours, or 10-12 hours on low, until the roast shreds easily with a fork (fork-tender.)\nPull the beef roast out of the sauce and place on a cutting board. Shred with 2 forks and mix the shredded meat back into the sauce. Keep on warm until ready to continue.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Scoop the meat into tortillas and roll.\nPlace each enchilada in a large 10x15-inch baking dish. Once the tortillas and meat are used up, spoon the remaining sauce over the top of the beef enchilada recipe and cover with shredded cheese.\nBake for 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve warm with your choice of fresh toppings.",
