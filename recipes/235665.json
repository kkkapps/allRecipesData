    "des": "\"Popcorn and candy in a candy sauce. Great for the holidays! Not too chewy and won't stick to your teeth (unless you overcook the sauce)! You can customize the candy, dried fruit, and nuts to what you like. Canadian Smarties\u00c2\u00ae can be used instead of M&M's\u00c2\u00ae. I've known people to press the mixture into a cake pan and cut pieces, too.\"",

Boil mixture for 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in vinegar.\nPour sugar mixture over popcorn mixture; mix until evenly coated. Spread coated popcorn mixture onto prepared baking sheets; cool. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.",
