    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 2 quart casserole dish.\nCover raisins with boiling water and let sit for 5 minutes. Drain well then toss them with the bread cubes.\nIn a skillet melt the butter and saute the onions, garlic, and celery for about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir the sauteed onions into the bread cube mixture. Add the diced apples, parsley, salt and paprika and stir carefully. Place stuffing mix in  the prepared dish or you can alternately place it in a large roaster with your favorite uncooked meat (pork chops, turkey, chicken, etc.).\nBake the dressing at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes. If you are baking the dressing with meat cook it until the meat is completely done all the way through.",
