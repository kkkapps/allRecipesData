    "des": "\"This is a famous Italian chocolate cake originally from Capri but popular throughout Southern Italy, where every family has its own recipe. It's a rich, dense chocolate cake that's made either with ground almonds or walnuts. Walnuts are used here, but you can substitute them with the same weight of ground almonds, if desired. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.\"",
