    "des": "\"Easy, tasty, customizable, you can do ahead of time...I could go on... If you want to mix it up, substitute a little sweet potato for some of the carrots. It is very tasty! Instead of 1/2 cup butter, you can use 2 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons vegetable or seed oil. Instead of 2 cups milk, you can use 1 cup milk and 1 cup chicken stock.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart casserole.\nPlace carrots into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 4 to 6 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.\nMelt 1/3 cup butter in a heavy saucepan over low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the melted butter until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt. Whisk flour into onion mixture until smooth; cook, stirring constantly, until flour mixture is a paste-like consistency and light brown, 5 to 10 minutes.\nIncrease heat to medium; gradually stream milk into flour mixture until thick and bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk Cheddar cheese, about 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring until cheese melts each time before adding more, forming a smooth sauce, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in mustard powder, white pepper, celery seed, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour sauce over carrots and toss to coat; transfer to the prepared casserole dish.\nMix 2 tablespoons melted butter and bread crumbs together in a bowl until well coated; sprinkle over carrot mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and topping is browned, 25 to 30 minutes.",
