Lightly beat the egg yolks.\nIn a small saucepan, heat chocolate, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons water, and coffee; stir constantly until melted.

Return the custard to the pan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat, and stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.\nWhen chocolate mixture has cooled, beat egg whites to soft peaks. Gradually add 2 tablespoons sugar, and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold whipped egg whites into chocolate mixture. Whip 1/2 cup cream until stiff, and fold into chocolate mixture. Spoon into pie crust and refrigerate.\nTo Make Topping: Add cocoa and confectioners' sugar to 1 cup whipping cream. Chill mixture 30 minutes, then whip until stiff.
