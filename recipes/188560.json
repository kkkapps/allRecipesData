    "des": "\"As long as you have the right kind of chourico, you cannot mess up this filling, slightly spicy soup. It's perfect for an autumn or winter meal, and can easily be adapted for vegans by using soyrizo (see note) instead of chourico. You can also use other vegetables, such as butternut squash or kale. I like to use organic spinach and vegetable broth when they are available.\"",
    "ins": "Cook the chourico in a soup pot over medium-high heat until it releases some oil. Add the chopped onion; stir and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in the garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes, sweet potatoes, vegetable broth, and thyme. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the sweet potatoes are soft, about 10 minutes.\nStir the baby spinach into the soup and continue cooking for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
