    "ins": "In a pressure cooker over medium heat, saute the garlic, onion and celery in the olive oil for 5 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Add the peas, broth, bay leaf and ham. Cook under pressure for 10 to 12 minutes. (Note: If you do not have a pressure cooker, cook the peas over low heat for 3 to 4 hours or use a slow cooker.)\nOnce the peas are soft, stir in the potatoes, carrots and chervil and simmer for 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add water as needed to adjust the thickness of the soup.",
