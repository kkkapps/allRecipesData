    "des": "\"My own version of posole! Stew made with hominy, garlic, peppers and pork meat. This is made in the slow cooker. I tried to make the stew as colorful as possible, which is why I use both white and yellow hominy and green and red bell peppers. This recipe is best the next day reheated. I love it best with cornbread or EVEN BETTER, fresh flour tortillas.  It is awesome on a cold winter day and is great to take to pot luck dinners.  Can be doubled or reduced in size to accommodate any number of people, and is a relatively foolproof recipe!\"",
    "ins": "Pour water into slow cooker, and set the cooker to High to preheat. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the pork on all sides, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Place the browned pork into the hot water in the slow cooker, leaving oil in the skillet. Cook and stir the green and red bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet over medium-low heat until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables into the slow cooker. Drop in the bouillon cubes. Add water if necessary to barely cover the ingredients, set the cooker to Medium, and cook until the vegetables are tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nPour in the diced tomatoes with chiles, and stir to combine. Cook for 1 more hour; stir in the hominy with liquid, cumin, red pepper, and black pepper, and cook 1 additional hour.",
