    "des": "\"My favorite recipe for a zucchini bread with a hint of coconut. Make sure to squeeze out as much liquid from the zucchini as possible after grating, otherwise the cake can get too mushy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a loaf pan.\nCombine flour, coconut, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.\nBeat sugar, oil, vanilla sugar, and cinnamon in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until foamy.\nPlace grated zucchini in a colander in the sink. Squeeze out as much liquid with your hands as possible. Add zucchini and eggs to the sugar mixture and mix well. Stir into flour mixture until well combined.\nPour zucchini batter into the prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
