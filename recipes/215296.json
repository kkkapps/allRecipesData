    "des": "\"This is a delicious chicken recipe that my mother used to make. It takes just minutes to prep, and cooks all day with no worries. The dried beef may be hard to find depending on your location. Ask the butcher at your market. I serve mine over egg yolk-free noodles; however, it's great over any pasta, rice, mashed potatoes...you name it. Put a chicken breast on the noodles, and pour the sauce over the chicken and noodles to serve.\"",
    "ins": "Grease the inside of a slow cooker, and lay the pieces of dried beef into the bottom of the cooker. Wrap each chicken breast in several pieces of bacon, and lay them into the cooker on top of the dried beef. Mix the soup, sour cream, and flour together in a bowl until the mixture is smooth, and pour it over the bacon-wrapped chicken. Cover the slow cooker, and cook on Medium setting for 4 to 6 hours. If your cooker only has 2 settings, cook on High for 2 to 3 hours and finish on Low for the remaining 2 to 3 hours.",
