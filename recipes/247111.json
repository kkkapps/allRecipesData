    "des": "\"I first tried this curry in a restaurant in Bangalore. I loved it so much that I asked all my friends if they knew anyone from Mangalore who could share the recipe with me. Finally, one of my friends came through. Below is an adaptation of her mother's recipe. If you like peppery curries and tamarind, you are sure going to love this style of curry. Serve with steamed plain rice or with chapati.\"",
