    "des": "\"Beef neck bones are a Southern staple recipe. I couldn't find a recipe online, so I created this one on my own by pulling from some of my favorite oxtail, roast, and pork neck bone recipes. Turned out yummy so I thought I'd share. Serve over steamed rice and peas or mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat slow cooker to High.\nClean neck bones and remove any excess fat. Season bones with cumin, allspice, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and salt; dust with 1/4 cup flour.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add seasoned neck bones; cook until bones begin to brown, about 1 minute per side.\nTransfer neck bones and drippings to the preheated slow cooker; add beef broth and onion.\nCook on High for 1 hour. Reduce heat to Low and cook 4 to 6 hours.\nTransfer neck bones to a dish. Sprinkle remaining flour into the slow cooker and stir well. Return neck bones to slow cooker. Let stand until gravy thickens, 15 to 20 minutes.",
