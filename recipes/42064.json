    "des": "\"My mother would always cook extra mashed potatoes so us kids could have these delicious puffs the next day. Over the years I have experimented with her basic recipe and sometimes will add grated cheddar cheese, chopped green onions and bacon bits to the mixture. I have also added corn niblets for a really different tasting puff.\"",
