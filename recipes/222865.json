    "des": "\"One of the vendors at the local farmers market was having a special on end-of-harvest kale. I figured it would go well with chicken and stumbled into this. The sauce is pretty heavy, and the kale and vinegar give it a good tangy flavor. My wife is allergic to garlic, otherwise I would have used 1/2 teaspoon of it instead of the salt. Serve over noodles or spaghetti.\"",
    "ins": "Combine kale, water, red wine vinegar, and sea salt in a saucepan; cook over medium heat until the kale wilts, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and drain, reserving the liquid. Set the kale aside.\nCombine the reserved liquid and the chicken in the saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the kale, cream, butter, and black pepper through the chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts and the mixture is hot, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the mixture; cook and stir until the cheese melts and the sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.",
