    "des": "\"This is a staple of Thai cooking. Adjust the spices to your own tastes for a really great use for leftover rice!! I get the basil from a local Asian market. It has a different flavor than that of regular basil and makes all the difference in this recipe. It is fast and fairly easy to make, but requires constant stirring.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the oyster sauce, fish sauce, and sugar in a bowl.\nHeat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat until the oil begins to smoke. Add the garlic and serrano peppers, stirring quickly. Stir in the chicken, bell pepper, onion and oyster sauce mixture; cook until the chicken is no longer pink. Raise heat to high and stir in the chilled rice; stir quickly until the sauce is blended with the rice.  Use the back of a spoon to break up any rice sticking together.\nRemove from heat and mix in the basil leaves. Garnish with sliced cucumber and cilantro as desired.",
