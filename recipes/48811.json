    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Cut in butter using a fork or your fingers until butter pieces are the size of small peas. Combine the lemon juice, lemon zest, and light cream; mix lightly into the dry mixture until a soft dough forms. Transfer to the prepared pan, and pat into the bottom and slightly higher on the sides to hold in the filling. Spread the cherry pie filling over the top.\nBake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crust at the edges is golden. Cool completely before cutting into squares.",
