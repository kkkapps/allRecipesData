Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.\nCook the frozen ravioli as directed on the package; drain. Spread the cooked ravioli in a layer into the bottom of the prepared baking dish; spoon the hot vegetables over the ravioli. Sprinkle with the cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.",
