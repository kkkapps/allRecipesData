    "des": "\"This is an easy and very flavorful recipe using white wine, scallops, mussels, and lemon. Great for an appetizer without the pasta or meal with it. Made it for the first time and we practically licked the pot clean! Goes great with a good white wine.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.\nCombine white wine, leek, butter, green onions, shallot, and garlic in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until leek and shallot soften, 2 to 4 minutes.\nStir scallops, mussels, salt, and pepper into the pot. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until scallops are opaque and mussels open, 2 to 4 minutes. Squeeze in juice from 2 lemon slices. Remove from heat; stir in heavy cream.\nDivide linguine between serving bowls. Scoop scallop and mussels on top. Serve with remaining lemon slices and toasted baguette.",
