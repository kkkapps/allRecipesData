    "ins": "Place the potatoes into a large saucepan and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain off all but 2 cups of the water, then stir in the cream of onion soup, luncheon meat, milk, and Cheddar cheese. Return to a simmer over medium heat, and cook a few minutes until hot. Season to taste with red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.",
