    "des": "\"Got this recipe from a friend WAY back in junior high. Super simple and tastes delicious. My kids ask for it all the time. If you love enchiladas, you'll love this recipe. You can use any flavor Doritos\u00c2\u00ae to suit your tastes. When reheating leftover casserole, stir in a little bit of milk to make it creamy again.\"",

Drain and discard excess grease.\nStir cream of chicken soup, enchilada sauce, and milk with the ground beef; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.\nSpread crushed tortilla snack chips into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour ground beef mixture over crushed chips; stir. Arrange cheese slices atop the mixture.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes; stir the melted cheese into the beef mixture.",
