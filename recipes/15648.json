    "ins": "Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nCut off top of bread and set aside.  Hollow loaf, leaving 1 1/2 to 2 inch shell. Reserve the bread that you pull out of the loaf.\nIn a medium-size bowl, combine cream cheese, onion, beer, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, hot pepper sauce, and salt. Beat well. Fold clams into the mixture. Pour clam mixture into the hollowed out bread bowl, cover the bread bowl with the bread top. Wrap the loaf in aluminum foil.\nBake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 3 hours. Use the leftover bread torn from inside the loaf to make bread cubes to dip with.  Toast bread cubes with dip during last 5 minutes of baking time.",
