Add dough. Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nGrease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.\nPunch dough down gently and divide into 2 portions. Place dough on the prepared pans. Cover and let rest, about 5 minutes. Stretch dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pans.\nArrange 8 sticks of cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with second pan.",
