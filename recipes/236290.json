    "des": "\"This simple, flavorful recipe is great as a sweetener in your favorite hot beverages and smoothies or as a topping on oatmeal, pancakes, pork, or fruit salad (apples, pears, peaches). It has a very heartwarming flavor, perfect for a cold day. Inspired by Billy's Favorite Gingerbread Spiced Coffee Syrup. I found this preparation method to be a lot easier.\"",
    "ins": "Place ginger, cinnamon sticks, allspice, peppercorns, nutmeg, and cloves together in a cheesecloth pouch or a large tea bag infuser.\nCombine water and spice bag in a large pot; bring to a boil. Boil, adding more water as necessary as water evaporates, until flavors are blended and 6 to 8 cups of liquid remain, about 45 minutes. Remove spice bag; when cool enough to handle, squeeze any excess liquid back into the pot.\nStir sugar and honey into spiced water; continue boiling until desired syrup consistency is reached, 1 to 2 hours. Transfer to clean bottles or jars to store.",
