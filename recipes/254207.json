Crumble cooked sausage into large serving bowl.\nCook apple, thyme, sage, and nutmeg over high heat in the hot skillet with the sausage grease. Stir to thoroughly brown all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and add to bowl with crumbled sausage.\nCombine balsamic vinegar and maple syrup in a small saucepan. Place over high heat. When mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until it begins to thicken and smells strongly acidic, about 10 minutes.
