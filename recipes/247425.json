    "des": "\"This can be a bit pricey to make with chanterelle mushrooms if you have to buy them but well worth every penny if you can afford it! Switch up the recipe with different mushrooms and rice combos and see what you come up with! Garnish with sour cream and parsley.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until soft but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add chanterelle mushrooms; cook and stir until excess liquid evaporates, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in wild rice; cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes.\nPour broth into the pot; bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until mushrooms are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, lemon juice, parsley, black pepper, dill, paprika, and salt. Simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes more.",
