    "des": "\"This is a 3 layer pie: the bottom crust, a creamy cheesecake-like layer, and  a delicious pecan pie layer on top.  Warning: this is very rich, and definitely NOT diet food.   Especially good with a dollop of whipped cream.  It might keep up to a week in the fridge, but it's never lasted that long at our house! Dark chocolate pieces may be used in place of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Instead of chopped pecans, trying arranging pecan halves in an eye-pleasing manner on top of pie.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, blend together cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/3 cup sugar, and salt.  Mix by hand until mostly smooth.  Spread  mixture into the bottom of the unbaked pie shell.  Sprinkle with chopped pecans.\nIn another bowl, slightly beat 3 eggs.  Stir in 1/4 cup sugar, corn syrup, and 1 teaspoon vanilla; blend well.  Fold in chopped  chocolate or chocolate chips.  Very CAREFULLY pour corn syrup mixture over pecans.    Cover pie crust edge with a strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until center is set.  Cool completely.  Store in refrigerator.",
