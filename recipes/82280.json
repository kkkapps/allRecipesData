    "des": "\"This recipe came from my grandmother, who used peas in her version instead of pickles. My mother changed the recipe and I have altered it even more. The flavors of these ingredients blended together in what is reminiscent of a cold macaroni or potato salad will be your family's new favorite!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Rinse under cold running water, then drain well and pat lightly with paper towels.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the macaroni, pickles, cheese, tuna, mayonnaise and mustard. Season with a splash of pickle juice, salt and pepper. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.",
