    "des": "\"This is a great appetizer using Witlof, commonly known as Belgian endive, which is also popular in the Netherlands. This is basic to cook and very tasty.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat a grill to medium heat. When the grill is ready, lightly brush the grate with oil.\nPlace the endive in a shallow baking dish with 1/4 cup of water. Cover with plastic wrap, and microwave for 2 minutes, or until slightly tender. Remove from dish, and pat dry.\nWrap each whole endive with prosciutto, and pierce with a toothpick to secure. Place each piece directly on grill and cook, turning occasionally, until ham is browned and endive is tender, approximately 3 minutes.\nPlace in a disposable foil baking dish, and sprinkle with the cheese. Return to the grill, cover, and continue cooking until cheese has melted.",
