    "ins": "In a small saucepan, combine the cornmeal and water. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Pour into a large mixing bowl. Stir in salt, oil and honey; let cool until lukewarm.\nIn a large bowl, combine the cooled cornmeal mixture with the yeast, rye flour, whole wheat flour and 4 cups unbleached flour; beat well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Allow dough to rise 30 minutes, or until doubled.\nDeflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until bottoms of the loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove from pans and allow to cool on a wire rack.",
