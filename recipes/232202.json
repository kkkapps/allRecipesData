Stir a couple times until curds separate from whey, about 5 minutes.\nLine a colander with cheese cloth. Pour curds and whey through colander and drain. Wrap curds with cheesecloth and place a heavy pot fill with water over curds to press and drain completely, about 2 hours. Curds will form a soft disk.",
