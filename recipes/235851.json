    "des": "\"This recipe is so simple, it doesn't even have a name. I just call it Trout. This is such an easy weeknight seafood dinner. It's a really nice way to cook fish, especially if you're new at cooking fish.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until butter smells toasted and is golden brown, about 1 minute. Turn off heat.\nLine a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil. Place trout onto foil; open trout so skin sides are down. Drizzle each trout with about 1/2 teaspoon melted butter. Generously season with salt and black pepper.\nMove an oven rack to 5 or 6 inches below heat source and preheat oven's broiler on high heat.\nBroil trout until opaque and barely firm to the touch, 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from oven.\nReturn pan of melted butter over high heat; stir in lemon juice and parsley. Bring butter sauce to a boil; whisk to combine. Serve trout on plates and drizzle with butter sauce.",
