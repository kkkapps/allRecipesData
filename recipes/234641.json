    "des": "\"Delicious, Mediterranean-influenced salad. It's a healthy whole food salad that can be eaten as a main dish or side dish. Eat immediately or chill for several hours.  I think it gets better after sitting for a few hours, as the raisins soften up and the wheat berries absorb some spice.  Eat up!\"",

Drain.\nBring 6 cups water and wheat berries to a boil in a saucepan; add 1 teaspoon olive oil and salt.

Drizzle dressing over wheat berry mixture; toss to coat and season with salt.",
