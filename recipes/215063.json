    "des": "\"Slightly bitter and extremely refreshing, this is one instance of what I have dubbed blender-miracles. Throw everything in and blend away! Make sure to use a well-ripened banana to add extra sweetness. If the end result is still slightly too bitter, blend in sugar to taste. This pairs nicely with a balsamic salad.\"",
    "ins": "Blend the ice and banana together in a blender set to Low until mixed, adding the lime juice and lemon juice as it blends to keep the ice from freezing to the side of the blender. Serve in a tall glass and garnish with coconut or a cherry.",
