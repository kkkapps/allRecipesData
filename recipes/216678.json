    "des": "\"This recipe makes a fantastic holiday meal, but everyone likes it so much that you won't wait for a holiday to make it again. Impressive as it looks and tastes, it is actually quite simple to make, and it's basically a meal in one roasting pan so even clean-up is a breeze.\"",
    "ins": "Allow the leg of lamb to rest at room temperature for 1 hour before cooking.\nPreheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven.\nWhisk the garlic, pepper, red pepper flakes, bay leaf, rosemary, 1/2 cup olive oil, vinegar, and honey together in a small bowl. Rub the mixture over the lamb, then season with 2 tablespoons coarse salt. Set aside. Place carrots, potatoes, beet, yam, and turnips in a large roasting pan. Toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil and a pinch of salt. Arrange the seasoned leg of lamb on top of the vegetables.\nRoast the lamb in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to  325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Continue roasting  to your desired degree of doneness, about 90 minutes more for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).\nAllow the leg of lamb on a cutting board, tented with aluminum foil, for 30 minutes before carving. Place the vegetables on a serving platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm until ready to serve.",
