    "des": "\"My inspiration for this splendid recipe came from a dish on the menu at Longhorn\u00c2\u00ae Steakhouse. I've guessed how it's made and decided to add strawberries to the salsa, but I am sure it will be fine with just pineapples. Strawberry preserves serve as the marinade base, mixed with soy, vinegar, and sesame oil.\"",
    "ins": "Mix strawberry preserves, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, sesame oil, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger, and pepper together in a bowl to make marinade. Pour 1/3 cup into a glass measuring cup; reserve. Place salmon fillets in the bowl.\nMarinate salmon in the refrigerator for 1 hour.\nMix strawberries, pineapple, onion, and parsley in a bowl to make salsa. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Oil a stainless steel grill basket. Place salmon fillets skin-side up in the basket; cook for 6 minutes. Flip and continue cooking skin-side down, about 6 minutes more.\nDivide salmon fillets among serving plates; drizzle reserved 1/3 cup marinade on top. Spoon salsa on top.",
