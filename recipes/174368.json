    "des": "\"So delicious and sweet! This pie, with its pastry crust and cinnamon-spiced oat topping, is the perfect combination of caramel apple pie and apple crumble.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nTo make the topping, combine the oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, slivered almonds, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs; set aside.\nRoll out the pie dough into a circle and transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the pastry and crimp the edge. Toss the apples with the lemon juice in a bowl to prevent browning. Combine the 1 tablespoon flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon; toss with the apples to coat. Drizzle 1/4 cup of caramel sauce over the bottom of the pie shell. Add the spiced apple mixture; drizzle with remaining 1/4 cup of caramel sauce. Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the apples.\nBake the pie in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the crust is browned.",
