    "des": "\"These are enormous, stick-to-your-ribs kind of burgers with a surprise in the center. A real family favorite.  I like to serve them on a bun topped with sauteed mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  Use extra lean or lean ground beef instead of medium because the bacon adds to the fat content of the meat.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.\nFry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add onions to the pan; cook and stir until bacon is browned, but not crisp and onion is soft. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with black pepper.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the ground beef and onion soup mix. Divide into 8 balls and then flatten into thin patties. Place a quarter of the bacon mixture onto each of four patties. Top with the remaining patties and press the edges together to seal.\nGrill the burgers for about 15 minutes, turning once, until well done. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.",
