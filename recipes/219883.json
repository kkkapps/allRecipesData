    "des": "\"The secret to creating great fried chicken at home is par-boiling the meat before frying. Believe it or not, this actually produces a incredibly crunchy piece of chicken while keeping the meat tender and juicy. Using wings gives you a ton of surface area for more crunch and more of the special sauce. The sauce in this recipe is a twist on the traditional Buffalo wing sauce with the addition of molasses and Worcestershire sauce for a slightly sweet and 'umami' flavor. Frying with lard adds flavor and extra crunch.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the water into a large stock pot and stir in the salt, red pepper flakes, and chicken bouillon granules. Bring the mixture to a boil.\nCook the chicken wings to the boiling water until no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.\nDrain the wings and set aside to cool until easy to handle, about 15 minutes.\nWhisk the flour, masa harina, paprika, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Press chicken wings into the seasoned flour until lightly coated; tap off excess flour.\nHeat canola oil and lard in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWorking in batches of about 6 wings at a time, deep-fry the wings until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set the wings aside to drain on paper towels.\nMelt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat, and whisk in the hot pepper sauce, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. Remove sauce from the heat.\nTo serve, stir the wings into the sauce, working in batches, until coated. Transfer wings to a serving dish to serve.",
