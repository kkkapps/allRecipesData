    "des": "\"This cake uses ground almonds to replace the wheat flour usually found in cakes.  When preparing the almonds, a hand grinder is preferable to a food processor or blender because electric machines bring out the oil in nuts. If a blender or food processor is used, grate only 1/2 cup at a time.  Do not pack down when measuring.\"",
    "ins": "Melt chocolate in top of double boiler; set aside.\nBeat egg yolks until thick and lemon colored.  Gradually beat in sugar.  Blend in chocolate and almonds.\nBeat egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Fold whites into chocolate batter.  Spoon batter into an ungreased 10 inch Bundt pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until cake springs back when lightly touched.  Remove from oven, invert pan, and cool about 40 minutes before removing from pan.",
