Try this recipe; you can't taste the alcohol, just the smoky character of the whisky. Serve with game chips or tatties-an-neeps.\"",

Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours.\nPreheat grill for high heat.\nBrush grate with oil, and arrange steaks over hot grate.  Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn, and cook until done to your liking, another 6 to 10 minutes.",
