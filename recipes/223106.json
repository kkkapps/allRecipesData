    "ins": "Place rhubarb and orange in a blender; blend until pureed and transfer to a saucepan. Add sugar and orange zest.\nBring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until marmalade is thickened, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Allow marmalade to cool; ladle into jars. Cover jars with lids and refrigerate until ready to use.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange chicken breast halves in a baking dish.\nMix 1 cup marmalade, water, curry powder, and salt in a bowl; spoon mixture over chicken breasts.\nBake in preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, basting occasionally, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve rhubarb sauce over chicken breasts.",
