Pour sauce over ribs to coat. Seal ribs in the foil. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat grill for high heat.\nPlace ribs in foil on the grill grate, and cook 1 hour. Remove ribs from foil, and place directly on the grill grate. Continue cooking 30 minutes, basting frequently with the sauce, until ribs are done.",
