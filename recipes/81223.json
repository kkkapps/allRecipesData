Add the bell peppers, black olives, and provolone cheese.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Pour over the ingredients in the container. Seal the lid, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, shaking gently about once per hour.\nTo serve, allow the mixture to come to room temperature.
