Alternating between meat and cheese, arrange layers of ham, turkey, salami, mozzarella, Swiss cheese and provolone. Add a layer of tomatoes, onion, black olives, mushrooms, green peppers and anything else you like. Place the remaining half of bread on top.\nPlace the sandwich on a cutting board, and slice into individual servings.",
