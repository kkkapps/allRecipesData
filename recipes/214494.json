    "des": "\"This is a grilled chicken recipe inspired by a dish found in Del Rio, TX. Truly a man's meal, and not for the faint of arteries, this dish combines three of men's favorite things: Grilling, Bacon, and Chili. Don't love it till you try it! Goes well with a light beer and mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nLay a chicken breast onto a work surface and place the palm of your hand down on the meat. With a sharp knife, carefully slice the chicken breast half horizontally, without cutting all the way through, and open up the sliced chicken breast like a book. Repeat with the other two chicken breasts.\nPlace each sliced, opened out chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.\nTo stuff the chicken breasts, lay out a flattened breast and place a skewer on the meat, in the center. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of chili over the skewer and top the chili with about a teaspoon of pepperjack cheese. Roll the chicken breast around the skewer and secure with toothpicks. Wrap each chicken roll with 2 slices of bacon and secure with toothpicks. Pour about 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce into a bowl, and brush each roll with sauce. Discard any leftover sauce.\nCook on the preheated grill, turning often and spraying the grill with water occasionally to prevent flare-ups, until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, the juices run clear, and the bacon is browned, about 15 minutes.\nPour more barbecue sauce into a clean bowl and brush the rolls again before removing from the grill. Let rest about 5 minutes before pulling out the toothpicks and skewers for serving.",
