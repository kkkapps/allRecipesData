    "des": "\"This is a quick pasta salad that is kicked up a notch by using tortellini instead of regular pasta. It is great for a cook-out or potluck because it doesn't include mayonnaise.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite and filling is warmed through, 5 to 7 minutes; drain.\nStir cooked tortellini, tomatoes, broccoli, yellow bell pepper, Parmesan cheese, and pepperoni together in a bowl. Pour in 1 cup Italian dressing and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. If salad looks dry, stir in an additional 1/4 cup Italian dressing before serving.",
