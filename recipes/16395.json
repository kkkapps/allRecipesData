    "des": "\"Marinated pork tenderloin rolled in puff pastry dough. This tastes great, and your friends and family will think you slaved for hours making it.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium nonporous bowl, combine the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice and mix well. Place the pork in the bowl, turning to coat well on all sides. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours, allowing the pork to marinate.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place tenderloin in a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nBake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until internal pork temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).\nRemove pork from oven. Drain the liquid from the baking dish and  reserve for later as a gravy, if desired. Roll out the two puff pastry sheets and wrap each piece of tenderloin in the dough, sealing the edges to completely enclose the meat. Return this to the baking dish.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.",
