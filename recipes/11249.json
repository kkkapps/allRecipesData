    "des": "\"Prepare a week in advance so that they will absorb a little moisture. Do not over bake.  Watch for the first signs of the dough becoming dull-finished: this signifies that the liquid that made it shiny during the beginning of the baking has evaporated.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nSift the cocoa powder through a fine strainer to eliminate lumps. Combine it with the flour, white sugar, ground almonds, cinnamon, cloves and baking soda.\nMake a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the honey and 1/4 cup of the water. Stir until a smooth, sticky dough forms. Allow to stand for 1 minute to absorb the liquid.\nTurn the dough out onto a generously floured surface and pat it into a 6X12 inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.  Flour the dough lightly and roll over it once or twice with a rolling pin to even it out. Cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch strips, then cut the strips diagonally to make diamond shapes and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.\nBake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Remove from pan to cool.\nTo Make The Icing: Mix the confectioners' sugar with the remaining 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Brush over the cooled cookies. The icing will crystallize and harden as it dries.",
