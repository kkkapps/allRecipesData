    "des": "\"This simple recipe was handed down to me from my grandmother.  She was a fabulous cook that could master elaborate dishes, but she also taught me how to make some easy and delicious meals. Slow baking makes this a 'fall of the bone' dish with even tougher cuts of pork!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the pork chops on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Place the chops into a 9x13-inch baking dish. In a large saucepan, whisk together the cream of chicken soup, cream of celery soup,and milk until smooth. Stir in the rice, and add the butter; bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, and stir until the butter has melted. Pour the rice mixture over the chops; cover the dish with foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until tender, about 2 hours.",
