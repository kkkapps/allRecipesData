    "ins": "Arrange the potato slices on a large plate. Cook in microwave on High until tender about 3 minutes.\nHeat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes to the skillet, season with the salt and pepper, and cook in the hot oil until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes. Set aside on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.\nStir the mango, onion, chives, tomato, red chile pepper, garlic, and lime juice together in a bowl.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the scallops in the hot oil until browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook for 1 minute longer.\nRemove scallops and place each individual scallop on top of a potato chip as a base, then smother liberally with the salsa. They should be big enough to cut up with a knife or put into the mouth whole.",
