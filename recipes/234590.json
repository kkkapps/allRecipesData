    "des": "\"My best friend Jenn made this recipe for football party we were having at our house, and it was the hit of the night! You can make it as mild or spicy as you like. I have so many people asking me for this recipe, so I thought I'd share it on here. If you cannot find Italian sausage meat, you can buy the Italian sausage in the casing and squeeze it out. Enjoy with tortilla chips.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.\nSpread cream cheese in an even layer into the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish. Layer salsa, sausage, and mozzarella over the cream cheese, respectively.\nBake in preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese is melted completely, about 20 minutes.",
