    "des": "\"This is a SUPER easy recipe that taste GREAT and will make your home smell simply WONDERFUL while baking!!  I usually serve the chicken on top a bed of rice.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together the brown sugar, paprika, salt, dry mustard, chili powder, vinegar, cayenne pepper, Worcestershire sauce, vegetable juice cocktail, ketchup, water and garlic. Pour the sauce evenly over the chicken breasts.\nBake uncovered, for 35 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove chicken breasts, shred with a fork, and return to the sauce. Bake in the oven for an additional 10 minutes so the chicken can soak up more flavor. Serve on a bed of rice with freshly ground black pepper.",
