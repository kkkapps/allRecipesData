    "des": "\"Sago is a starch, very similar to tapioca, that is extracted from palm trees.  You can substitute tapioca in this recipe, if you don't have sago on hand.  Serve with brandy sauce or custard.\"",

Stir in brown sugar, bread crumbs, raisins, currants, dates, eggs and butter until well combined.  Spoon into prepared basin.  Place a piece of waxed or parchment paper over the top of the basin and secure the lid.\nPlace the basin on a trivet or dish in a large pot and fill the pot with boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the basin.  Bring the water to a boil again, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer 3 1/2 to 4 hours, topping off water as necessary, until pudding is firm.",
