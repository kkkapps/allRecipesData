    "des": "\"This soup began as something else that evolved as it was being cooked. After tasting it a few times, it needed something else. So the Thai red curry paste, lime juice, and coconut milk were added after cooking for 4 hours. That was the magic! Everyone who tried it was very satisfied, except one who didn't care for anything spicy. This isn't overpoweringly spicy, just enough heat tamed by the lime juice and coconut milk. Have fun!\"",
    "ins": "Place the red beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak 8 hours to overnight.\nDrain and rinse beans. Put beans in a slow cooker; add quinoa, barley, celery, tomato, garlic, red chile pepper, green bell pepper, green onion, curry paste, ginger, chicken bouillon, Italian seasoning, black pepper, chives, onion powder, and garlic powder to the beans.\nCook on High, stirring occasionally, until the beans and barley are tender, about 4 hours. Stir coconut milk and lime juice into the soup; cook 15 minutes more.",
