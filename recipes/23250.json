    "des": "\"Tasty and not too hard to make. If you prefer, use 8 small tomatoes, bake in muffin cups and reduce baking time to 15 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a small saucepan over high heat, bring water to a boil.  Stir in rice; cover and remove from heat. Let stand covered 5 minutes or until water is absorbed. Fluff with fork.\nSlice off the top of each tomato and scoop out the pulp, leaving a 1/4 inch thick shell.  Reserve 3 tablespoons of pulp, chopped.  Invert the tomatoes to drain.\nIn a medium bowl combine rice, tomato pulp, green pepper, onion, parsley, salt, garlic and olive oil; mix well.  Spoon filling into tomato shells.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.",
