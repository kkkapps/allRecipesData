    "ins": "Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until onion softens, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir pine nuts into onion mixture; saute until fragrant and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir lemon zest, vegetable bouillon, and turmeric into onion mixture; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice to mixture and cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes more.\nPour rice mixture in a rice cooker and add water. Set the rice cooker to the regular white rice cycle, and select Start. Fluff cooked rice with a fork and top rice with green onion and basil. Close rice cooker and steam green onion and basil until tender, about 5 minutes.\nStir mushrooms into rice and place spinach on top. Close rice cooker again and steam until spinach wilts slightly, about 5 minutes more. Add chicken, artichoke hearts, and Parmesan cheese; stir to combine. Season with black pepper.",
