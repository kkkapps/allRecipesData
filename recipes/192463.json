    "des": "\"This is a recipe that is meant to be shared, particularly by lovers or those embarking on a newly-formed relationship. It quick and easy and leaves time for more  shall we say 'interesting indulgences' afterwards. Enjoy with some baked sweet potato fries! Add a simple salad, or grilled vegetables with a nice semi-sweet wine and have a wonderful evening. Have Fun!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSeason the sea bass with salt and pepper; arrange in a baking dish and set aside.\nMelt the butter with the olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the shallots, garlic, and parsley in the melted butter and olive oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the flour and stir continually until completely incorporated into the mixture and the liquid is smooth. Pour the half-and-half into the mixture while stirring; cook and stir until thickened. Season with the white pepper. Gently fold the crawfish tails and crabmeat into the mixture, taking care to not break the crabmeat too much; cook another 1 minute. Spoon the mixture over the sea bass fillets.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve immediately.",
