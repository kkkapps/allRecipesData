Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nCook in preheated oven until no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, stir together the mai tai drink, pineapple, and sweet and sour mix in a bowl until evenly blended. Remove chicken from oven, and top with half of the pineapple mixture. Return to oven, and cook chicken until juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. Serve with remaining pineapple mixture.",
