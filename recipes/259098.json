    "des": "\"This recipe for cloud eggs, centuries old, was developed in France, called Eggs in Snow, or Oeufs a la Neige. It's a show-stopping brunch dish that is actually ridiculously easy to make.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBeat egg whites, salt, and pepper in a bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold Parmesan cheese in gently.\nMake 2 mounds of egg whites on the prepared baking sheet. Create a small indent in the centre of the egg whites with the back of a spoon.\nBake egg whites in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove egg whites from the oven and carefully place 1 yolk in the centre of each indent. Place back in the oven until yolks look set, about 3 minutes.\nCarefully remove cloud eggs from the parchment paper with a spatula or fish slice; slide onto plates. Sprinkle chives on top.",
