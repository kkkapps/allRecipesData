    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace saltine crackers into a large, heavy plastic zipper bag, and gently crush into crumbs by rolling the bag with a rolling pin; alternately, place crackers into the work bowl of a food processor and pulse briefly just to break into crumbs. Two sleeves of crackers should make about 3 cups of crumbs. Reserve 3/4 cup of crumbs; place 2 1/4 cup of crumbs into a large mixing bowl.\nMix the 2 1/4 cups of cracker crumbs in the mixing bowl with ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, mustard, black pepper, soda, rosemary, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, garlic powder, dill relish, sweet relish, egg, self-rising flour, tomato sauce, and onion until thoroughly combined. Form into a loaf, and place into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Top the loaf with the reserved cracker crumbs.\nBake in the preheated oven until the loaf is browned, no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes to 1 hour, checking after 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the loaf, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
