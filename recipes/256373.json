    "des": "\"Sweet potatoes have been a holiday staple for many years and score 101 next to the regular white potato. Combining them with a coconut streusel topping is simply a divine union! This is the ultimate favorite holiday recipe not only for my immediate family, but hands down, my dad's too! I'm sure you'll receive a 5-star rating!\"",

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and measure 3 cups sweet potatoes; transfer back into the pot. Reserve remaining sweet potatoes for another use.\nMix white sugar, milk, eggs, cubed butter, and vanilla extract into sweet potatoes using an electric mixer until completely smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared dish.\nCombine pecans, coconut, brown sugar, flour, and melted butter in a bowl until evenly mixed and crumbly; sprinkle evenly over sweet potato mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until topping is browned, 20 to 30 minutes.",
