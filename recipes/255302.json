Like any flour recipe, the amount of flour required isn't a given. It will change depending on the size of your eggs and the humidity of your region.\"",
    "ins": "Pile flour onto a work surface and make a small well in the center; place eggs, egg yolks, olive oil, and salt into the well. Gently stir the egg mixture with a fork, gradually drawing in flour until dough comes together.\nKnead dough with hands until smooth and leathery, about 10 minutes.\nWrap dough in plastic wrap; let rest until malleable, 1 to 2 hours. Remove plastic wrap.\nCut dough into four pieces; roll out with a rolling pin. Run flattened pieces through a pasta roller to create desired noodle shape.",
