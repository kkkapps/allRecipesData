    "des": "\"Makes excellent banana, coconut, or chocolate cream pie. This was given to me by a friend many years ago. For banana slice a layer of bananas in pie pan then fill half full with filling add more bananas then rest of filling. For chocolate, add 2 squares semi-sweet chocolate to hot milk and an additional 1/2 cup sugar. Good just to eat as pudding.\"",
    "ins": "In a sauce pan, combine milk and butter. Bring to a boil. In a medium bowl, combine eggs, sugar, cornstarch and salt. Slowly whisk 1 cup of hot milk mixture into egg mixture. Gradually whisk egg mixture back to remaining milk mixture. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Allow to cool.",
