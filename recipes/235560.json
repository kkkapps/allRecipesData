    "des": "\"These five-spice roast carrots are amazingly aromatic and delicious. The ingredients are so simple. Exotic, but familiar and not too exotic.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCut halved carrots in half again crosswise on the diagonal. Place carrots into a 2-quart baking dish and drizzle with vegetable oil; sprinkle with 5-spice powder and salt to taste. Toss lightly to coat carrots with oil and seasoning. Arrange carrots into an even layer.\nRoast carrots in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; check for tenderness and stir if desired. Continue roasting until tender, 15 to 20 more minutes.",
