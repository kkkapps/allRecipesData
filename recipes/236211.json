    "des": "\"Wonderful crispy onions made from Vidalia\u00c2\u00ae or any good sweet yellow onions. These are famous in several restaurants around the Southeast. A great southern staple. Serve hot for best results. Slice onions as thin as possible. You should be able to see the knife clearly through the onion as you slice it.\"",
    "ins": "Pour buttermilk into a bowl. Place onion slices into buttermilk, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nWhisk flour, cornmeal, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a bowl. Working in batches, remove onions from buttermilk, letting any excess liquid drip off, place onions in flour mixture and toss to coat. Shake any excess flour mixture off onions.\nCook onion rings in the preheated oil until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer rings with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.",
