    "des": "\"Every time I serve this, I get phone calls asking for the recipe. So here is the secret to my famous Honey Skirt Steak for all of those that have asked. Told you it is easy! A great before-dinner treat or side dish. If done right, this will blow your socks off. The skirt will have a honey glaze complemented with a nice horseradish sauce. Very easy, very fast, and a load of complements to follows. Horsey Sauce is to your preferred taste. I prefer to cut the horseradish with mayo instead of sour cream - I like a sharper flavor to my sauce. Sour cream could be used, of course.\"",
    "ins": "Pound skirt steak briefly on each side with the textured side of a meat mallet.\nCut a piece of parchment twice as long as the skirt steak; place steak on top half of the paper. Rub top of steak with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper; drizzle 1 tablespoon honey in an S-shaped line down the top of the steak.\nFold bottom of the parchment paper up over the steak; flip steak over and peel the parchment paper from the unseasoned side of steak. Repeat seasoning with remaining 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 more tablespoon honey.\nFold  parchment paper tightly around  steak, folding the edges over several times so honey can't leak out. Place wrapped steak in a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nLay steak on the hot grill; grill for 1 minute, then use tongs to flip steak and move to another area of the hot  grate. Continue flipping and moving the steak at 1-minute intervals until the steak is very well seared on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes in all. Inside of meat should still be pink.\nRemove steak and wrap in aluminum foil; let rest 5 to 10 minutes before cutting the steak diagonally across the grain into 1/2-inch strips.\nMix horseradish, mayonnaise, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl; serve as dipping sauce with steak.",
