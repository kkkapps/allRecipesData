    "des": "\"Originated in Persia, brought to India during Akbar period, and modified in Kashmir. \nThe recipe varies from region to region and restaurant to restaurant. North Indian Korma is pale yellow in color from saffron and cooked without any tomatoes or turmeric. This recipe version will be the closest to the traditional Kashmiri Korma. Kashmir Pandits substitute onion and garlic with asafoetida. Serve with jasmine rice and mango chutney.\"",
