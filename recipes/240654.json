    "des": "\"A 2.24-pound beauty of a roast. I had read other recipes for cooking a roast in slow cooker, none of which sounded like my goal recipe. So here it is a new take on a slow cooking roast recipe.\n\nThe roast is a 2.24-pound beef loin tri-tip seasoned roast. This one had very little fat.\"",
    "ins": "Coat the inside of a slow cooker with about 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nCoat the inside of a skillet with about 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat over medium-high heat. Cook roast in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Cook and stir onion in the hot oil during the last 5 minutes of browning the roast. Transfer roast to the slow cooker, reserving onion in the skillet.\nPour water over onion; crumble bouillon cube into water. Add garlic and adobo seasoning to onion mixture; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture over roast.\nCook on High until meat is cooked through and tender, about 4 hours.",
