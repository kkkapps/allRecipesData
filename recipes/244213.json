I do this in the morning and then all I have to do at dinner time is assemble my kabobs and grill them! I serve with a rice pilaf of brown rice and wild rice.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk orange marmalade, balsamic vinegar, red wine, olive oil, chives, basil, garlic, sage, garlic salt, and kosher salt together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Pour about 1/4 of the marinade into a resealable plastic bag; add mushrooms, bell pepper, and red onion. Squeeze air out of bag and seal.\nPour the remaining marinade into a separate resealable bag; add chicken. Squeeze air out of bag and seal. Marinate vegetables and chicken in the refrigerator, 2 to 8 hours.\nRemove vegetables and chicken from bag and discard marinade. Thread vegetables, chicken, and pineapple onto skewers.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCook kabobs on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes per side.",
