    "des": "\"I stumbled upon this recipe when I was both desperate for some dip and looking for a way to use up some frozen turnip greens I had in the freezer. I am not normally a huge turnip fan, but this recipe is so incredibly delicious, I even prefer it to spinach dip. I make this recipe with beef soujouk (beef sausage) from the Middle Eastern foods store instead of bacon because of a pork allergy, but it tastes great either way.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until some of the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in tarragon vinegar; cook for 2 minutes.\nPlace turnip greens in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in bacon mixture. Add cream cheese, sour cream, Parmesan cheese, paprika, and salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until creamy and heated through, about 15 minutes.",
