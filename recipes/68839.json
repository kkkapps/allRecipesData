    "des": "\"I love making this as an appetizer if we're planning on having a heavy dinner - it's a light healthful treat made with papaya, tomato and red pepper in a lovely papaya seed dressing.  Awesome with pieces of fresh baguette, crackers or tortilla chips.\"",
    "ins": "Cut papaya in half and remove seeds. Reserve 2 tablespoons of seeds for the dressing. Peel and dice the papaya, and place in a medium bowl. Add tomatoes, red onion, red pepper and basil, and set aside.\nIn a food processor or blender, combine the papaya seeds, sugar, wine vinegar, oil, mustard and green onions. Process until smooth and thick, and most of the seeds have broken up. Pour over the papaya mixture and stir to coat all of the ingredients. Serve with slices of baguette.",
