    "des": "\"This tender, slow-cooked beef tastes great on burritos and tacos.  My family of 8 goes nuts over it, and 5 lbs. of this meat isn't enough to satisfy them.  It takes a long time to prepare, but the wait is worth the effort.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare a smoker with dampened hickory wood charcoal.  The heat inside your grill or smoker should be around 180 to 200 degrees F (80 to 95 degrees C). Combine the black pepper, oregano, cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and seasoned salt in a small bowl until thoroughly mixed.\nPlace the chuck roast into a mixing bowl, and rub all over with the spice mixture. Place the meat into the smoker, and smoke for 1 1/2 hours, turning about every half hour. The meat should be a dark red color, and the edges should be darkened. Place the meat into a roasting pan, and seal tightly with aluminum foil.\nPreheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nBake the barbacoa in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours until very tender. Uncover the beef, and shred with two forks while still hot.",
