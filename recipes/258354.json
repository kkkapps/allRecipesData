    "des": "\"Tart cherries are hard to find where I live but when we occasionally come across them, we look forward to making this recipe to put over local vanilla bean gelato. Sweet and tart all at the same time. Also delicious on ice cream, pound cake, pancakes, Greek yogurt... The options are endless! It's the taste of summer for our family! Keeps up to 3 days in the fridge.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 3/4 cup water, sugar, and cinnamon to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cherries; bring back to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until cherries soften, about 5 minutes.\nMix 2 tablespoons water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour over the cherry mixture in the saucepan. Stir until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a container and refrigerate.",
