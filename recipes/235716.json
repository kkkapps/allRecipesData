    "ins": "Pour flour into a wide, shallow bowl. Dredge chicken pieces in flour to coat completely.\nHeat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Saute onion in hot oil until softened, 6 to 7 minutes; season with curry powder, salt, cumin, cinnamon, garlic powder, black pepper, and coriander. Continue cooking until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute.\nIncrease heat to medium-high. Stir flour-coated chicken pieces into the onion mixture; cook and stir until the chicken is browned on the outside, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPour chicken broth into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the sauce begins to thicken, about 8 minutes. Stir yogurt into the liquid until smooth; cook until the sauce is again hot, 2 to 3 minutes.",
