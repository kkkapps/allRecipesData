    "ins": "Place Brussels sprouts in a saucepan with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 7 to 10 minutes, or until just tender; drain.\nIn a separate saucepan large enough to hold the Brussels Sprouts, melt the butter and cook the onion until browned. Remove saucepan from heat, and stir in the flour until smooth. Return saucepan to low heat, and continue stirring until flour is lightly browned. Gradually blend in the beef broth. Season with salt, pepper, and cloves. Stir in the brown sugar and lemon juice. Place the cooked Brussels sprouts in the mixture, and allow to simmer 5 minutes before serving.",
