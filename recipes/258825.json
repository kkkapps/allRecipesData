Pour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool.\nPoke holes all over the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon. Whisk milk and pudding mix together in a bowl until just starting to thicken. Pour over cake, spreading with spatula to fill the holes. Refrigerate to firm, about 1 hour.\nPlace chocolate chips in a glass bowl. Heat heavy whipping cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until bubbles form, about 3 minutes. Pour over the chocolate chips; whisk until smooth. Spread chocolate ganache over cake with a spatula.",
