Spread mixture in a single layer onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until squash is tender and golden, 30 to 40 minutes.\nCombine kale and broth in a heavy-bottom skillet; bring to a light simmer. Cover skillet, reduce heat, and cook until kale is tender but still bright green, about 5 minutes; drain any excess liquid. Mix kale, squash mixture, and remaining balsamic vinegar together in a serving bowl.",
