    "ins": "Mix sugar, corn syrup, and water together in a microwave-safe bowl.\nCook sugar mixture in the microwave until mixture is 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), or until a small amount of sugar mixture dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball, 3 minutes.\nBeat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.\nStir sugar mixture into egg whites until no longer glossy, about 7 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract.\nDrop candy by teaspoonfuls onto a sheet of waxed paper. Let stand until cooled, 15 minutes.",
