    "des": "\"A friend came to visit me in Brazil, and we both had this dish in a restaurant. It was delicious and I tried to recreate a similar recipe at home. The restaurant version also contained snow peas, but I chose not to use the snow peas and focused on the heart of palm instead.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion; cook and stir until it begins to turn golden brown at the edges, about 2 minutes. Pour in the rice, and stir until the rice is coated in oil and has started to toast, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the white wine. Let it cook until it has mostly evaporated, then stir in one-third of the boiling vegetable broth; continue stirring until incorporated. Repeat this process twice more, stirring constantly. Incorporating the broth should take 15 to 20 minutes in all.\nWhen the rice is mostly tender, but still has a very slight crunch, stir in the hearts of palm and Parmesan cheese; season with salt and pepper. Cook for another minute to heat through then stir in parsley and butter, and serve immediately.",
