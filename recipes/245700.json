    "des": "\"Coming from a Vietnamese family, we have to find ways to cook traditional food on the fly and this is a recipe that my mom came up with years ago. Serve with your choice of garnishes - bean sprouts, Thai basil, chiles, etc. You can also make this kho - which is dry in Vietnamese - essentially putting the broth on the side and serving the noodles with the sauce recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Cover noodles with cold water; set aside to soak, about 30 minutes.\nPlace chicken, ginger, star anise, and monosodium glutamate in a large pot. Sprinkle with salt and cover with water. Cook over medium heat until juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nRemove chicken from pot and cool until easily handled, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove skin and shred chicken meat.\nDrain noodles. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and divide among serving bowls.\nTop noodles with shredded chicken and ladle in broth.",
