    "ins": "Place the water, olive oil, salt, oregano, bread flour, and yeast in the bread machine pan in the order recommend by the manufacturer. Select the dough cycle.\nMeanwhile, to make the filling, squeeze out excess liquid from broccoli. In a large skillet saute the broccoli and garlic powder with the olive oil. Stir in the grated provolone cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, grated mozzarella cheese, and ricotta cheese.\nOnce bread cycle has finished, remove dough from machine and roll into 8 inch circles. Spread filling on one half of the circle leaving a border around it for closing. Close the calzone by folding the unfilled side on top of the filled side. Crimp the edges closed with your fingers or a fork. Place on a lightly greased baking pan. Let rise in a draft-free area for 30 minutes.\nBrush tops lightly with olive oil. Bake in a preheated 500 degree F (260 degrees C) oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.",
