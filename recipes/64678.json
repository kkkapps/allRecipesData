    "des": "\"This easy-to make recipe is very inexpensive. I made it for my boyfriend's family and his mother is Filipino!  They loved it!  You can really mix in a lot of different ingredients to spice it up or make it your own.  Try different Ramen noodle flavors.\"",
    "ins": "Press tofu between paper towels to remove some of the water; cut in to bite size cubes.  Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu, and fry until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.\nMeanwhile bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add noodles from ramen packages, reserving the seasoning envelopes. Boil for about 2 minutes, just until the noodles break apart. Drain.\nAdd the stir-fry vegetables to the pan with the tofu, and season with the ramen noodle seasoning packet. Cook, stirring occasionally until vegetables are tender, but not mushy. Add noodles, and stir to blend. Season with soy sauce to taste and serve.",
