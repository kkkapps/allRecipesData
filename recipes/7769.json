    "ins": "Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 2 1/2  to 3-quart ovenproof bowl. Place sugar in a bowl and stir in black food color until desired color is achieved. Set aside.\nPrepare cake batter according to package directions. Pour batter into the prepared bowl and bake until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Let cake cool for 15 minutes in the bowl then invert and let cake cool completely.\nOnce cake is completely cool, trim flat side of cake and place on a cake board. Trim edges into a ball shape. Frost with the white frosting. Next, using a toothpick, draw a pentagon in the center top of the cake. Surround the pentagon with five hexagons. Repeating to cover entire cake. Cover lines with black licorice cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces. Fill the pentagon shapes with black-colored white sugar.",
