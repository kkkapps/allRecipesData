    "ins": "Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.\nWhisk milk, pumpkin, egg, and oil together in a bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture and stir until just moistened. Batter will be slightly lumpy.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.",
