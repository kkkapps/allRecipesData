    "des": "\"With the variety of gourmet smoked sausages on the market these days, I wanted a recipe that was hearty, but still allowed the wonderful flavor of the sausage to shine through.  With plenty of input from my father and my husband, this recipe was born.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet, reserving the drippings. Add the onion and green pepper to the drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until tender but still crisp. Stir in the hash browns and cook for about 5 minutes, until browned. Return sausage to the skillet, season with salt and pepper. Heat through and serve.",
