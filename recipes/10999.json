    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugars.  Add beaten egg and vanilla, mix well.  Sift flour, baking soda and salt together. Stir into creamed mixture; blend thoroughly. Fold in chocolate chips.\nDrop by teaspoon onto cookie sheets.  Bake in oven for 6-9 minutes, depending on size.  Do not overbake.  Cookies should be a little brown around the edges when taken out.  Let cookies cool for a few minutes before removing from baking sheet.  Finish cooling on rack.  NOTE: If you use miniature chocolate chips, you can decrease the amount needed in recipe from 11/4 cups to 1 cup and not affect the quality of the cookies.",
