    "des": "\"A hearty and tasty stew that will please even the most demanding eater. The chickpeas, eggplant, salami, garlic, and cilantro will make people think you have worked all day to put this together. Goes well with white steamed rice as a side dish and fresh baked bread. Great for those chilly nights and to uplift your spirits.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the salami, and cook until evenly browned. Mix in onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook until tender. Mix in eggplant, tomato paste, and cilantro, and season with salt, pepper, and oregano. Continue cooking 15 minutes. Mash the eggplant as it softens, and add a little water if necessary to keep the ingredients from drying out.\nStir the garbanzo beans, tomatoes, bay leaves, and green onions into the skillet, and pour in the water. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in vinegar and hot sauce before serving.",
