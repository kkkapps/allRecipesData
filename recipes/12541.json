    "des": "\"This pie is exactly like a pecan pie with the exception that it has oatmeal in it, rather than pecans. During baking, the oatmeal forms a chewy, \"nutty\" crust on top For a delicious variation, try the chocolate version. Just substitute 1/4 cup cocoa for the spices; this makes it taste very fudgy.\"",
    "ins": "Cream together butter or margarine and sugar.  Stir in cinnamon, cloves, and salt.  Stir in syrup.  Add eggs one at a time, stirring after each addition until blended.  Stir in oats.  Pour filling into pie shell.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.",
