Press into cups of a non-stick muffin tin.\nLightly oil a skillet and place over medium-high heat. Cook turkey in skillet, separating into small pieces as it browns.  When turkey is no longer pink, turn heat down to medium-low. Add taco seasoning, stirring to combine. Stir in Sloppy Joe sauce; continue cooking until heat through, about 5 minutes.\nFill biscuit-lined muffin cups with turkey mixture.\nBake in preheated oven until browned and hot, about 13 minutes.\nDivide each slice of cheese into quarters, and place one-quarter slice on top of each filled cup.\nBake 3 minutes more, or until cheese is melted.\nAllow to cool in the pan 5 minutes, then place on a rack until cool enough to eat.",
