    "des": "\"This is a twist on Tater Tot\u00c2\u00ae hot dish. This is an easy recipe to personalize. You can use any ground meat or a mixture of beef and pork. I often use smoked Gouda cheese, Havarti cheese, and I bet Swiss cheese would be good, too. The vegetable can be easily switched to any vegetable you like (string beans, broccoli, or mixed veggies). I would use fresh or frozen rather than canned if you can.\"",

Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
