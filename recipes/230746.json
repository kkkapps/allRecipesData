    "des": "\"There's much debate over how many of America's greatest recipes got their name, but that's not an issue with Oysters Rockefeller. Thanks to the rich, money-colored butter sauce, this decadent creation's name pretty much wrote itself. Serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon over the top.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Pour rock salt into a large, shallow casserole dish.\nCombine watercress, butter, bread crumbs, green onions, celery, tarragon, Italian parsley, anise-flavored liqueur, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; blend until smooth.\nPlace 8 to 12 shucked oysters on top of the rock salt. Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons of watercress mixture a top each oyster.\nBake in the preheated oven until oysters are firm and butter has melted, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining oysters.",
