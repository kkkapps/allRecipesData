    "des": "\"That delicious old-country taste right at home. Always a big hit. Whip up some mashed potatoes and even some peas and carrots and you've got a whole meal ready to go! Amount of left-over mixture depends on how evenly and how thoroughly you coat each steak. Tweaking and experimenting will be required to nail down a better proportion ratio so that there is less mix left over.\"",
    "ins": "Beat 2/3 cup milk and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk crackers, 3/4 cup flour, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a shallow bowl.\nHeat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.\nDip each steak into the milk-egg mixture; transfer to cracker mixture and press to coat evenly.\nFry coated steaks in the hot oil until browned, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer cooked steaks to a serving platter, retaining drippings in the skillet.\nStir 1/2 cup flour into steak drippings until dissolved and pasty, 3 to 4 minutes. Cook and stir onion into flour mixture until evenly coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour 2 3/4 cup milk into onion mixture; cook and stir until gravy is smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup oil to gravy; cook and stir until incorporated and gravy is boiling, about 1 minute. Season gravy with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper; serve alongside steak.",
