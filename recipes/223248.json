    "ins": "Chill a bowl in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 20 minutes.\nCombine cream cheese, peanut butter, and confectioners' sugar together in a separate bowl. Add about half the light cream; beat on low speed with an electric mixer, gradually increasing speed to high until mixture is smooth and thick. Scrape sides of bowl with a rubber spatula. Add remaining light cream, beating on low; gradually increase to high until well blended.\nBeat heavy cream in the chilled bowl on high speed with an electric mixer until just past soft peaks, but not stiff peaks. Lift your beater straight up: the heavy cream will hold its shape, but won't form sharp peaks. Gently fold into peanut butter mixture. The batter will be swirled with streaks of white from the cream and brown from the peanut butter.\nPour batter into prepared crust. Freeze uncovered for 1 hour. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and freeze until set, 6 hours.",
