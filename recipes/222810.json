    "des": "\"I needed a quick and easy side dish to take to our friend's house for their son's birthday. This dish needed to be something that would be able to be outside and be pretty, so this is what I came up with.

Add dressing and toss to coat. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.",
