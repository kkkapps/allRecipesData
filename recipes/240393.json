    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 pie dishes with prepared pie crusts.\nStir corn, peas, and carrots together in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Cook in the microwave until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.\nStir corn mixture, turkey, gravy, green beans, bacon bits, parsley, sage, thyme, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Divide turkey mixture even between the two prepared pie dishes. Place remaining crusts over the top of each pie, trim pastry to fit, crimp and pinch the edges together to seal. Cut 4 slits in the top of each pie.\nWhisk egg and water together in a small bowl. Brush egg mixture over the top of each pie. Fold a strip of aluminum foil around the outer edges of each pie crust.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned and heated through, about 45 minutes. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.",
