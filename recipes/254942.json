    "des": "\"A tender, juicy grilled pork tenderloin accented with an Asian-inspired honey garlic sauce with a touch of citrus. Excellent served with rice, or teriyaki noodles and steamed broccoli or green beans.\"",
    "ins": "Place pork in a large shallow dish. Sprinkle black pepper over both sides; press gently into the surface.\nWhisk soy sauce, honey, olive oil, orange juice, and ginger together in a bowl to make marinade. Stir in garlic and red pepper flakes.\nPour marinade over pork; turn to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap; let marinate in the refrigerator, 6 hours to overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove pork from marinade, reserving marinade in the dish. Grill pork, covered, basting occasionally with 1/4 of reserved marinade, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 12 to 15 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest, about 5 minutes.\nPour 3/4 of reserved marinade into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until reduced by 1/2 into a thick sauce, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard garlic slices.\nSlice pork into 1-inch thick slices. Arrange on serving plates. Drizzle thickened sauce over pork.",
