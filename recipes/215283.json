    "ins": "Whisk together the yogurt, onion, lemon juice, turmeric, cumin, paprika, salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess.\nCook the chicken on the preheated grill until well-browned and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.\nPour the water, oil, and remaining marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened and bubbling, about 10 minutes; stir in the chicken.\nServe chicken on the pita breads, and top with cucumber and parsley.",
