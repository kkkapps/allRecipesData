    "des": "\"This is a mild one-pot chili featuring Knorr\u00c2\u00ae Spanish Rice. It brings all the comfort of your standard bowl of chili, but with a wonderful mildly seasoned and sweet taste that is sure to be a hit with family and friends, both young and old! Garnish with your favorite toppings; I chose shredded cheese, cilantro, onion, black olives, and a dab of sour cream. This would be great served with corn bread and a side salad.\"",

Drain excess grease.\nStir diced tomatoes, black beans, and corn niblets into the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and stir in water and Spanish rice mix. Simmer until rice is fluffy and tender, about 7 minutes. Let stand before serving, about 2 minutes.",
