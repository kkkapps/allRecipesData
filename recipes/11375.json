    "des": "\"A luscious coconut, pecan, caramel, sour cream brownie that will have your taste buds dancing and begging for more. We have at times even melted caramels on top with the pecans instead of the chocolate chips, or have mixed caramels into the batter along with everything else. Your friends will demand the recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x9 inch baking pan.\nMix the brownie mix according to box directions, omitting 1/2 of the oil asked for. Stir in the sour cream and coconut pecan frosting. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.\nBake for 20 to 30 minutes in preheated oven, or until done. Be careful not to overbake, or they will harden and be impossible to eat! About 5 minutes before brownies are done, remove from oven, and sprinkle chocolate chips over the top along with chopped pecans.  Place back in the oven for 5 minutes. Remove pan from oven, and use a spatula to spread the melted chocolate chips over the top to frost the brownies.",
