    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, reserving about 1/2 cup cooking water.\nHeat olive oil in medium-sized pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion until it starts turning translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tuna, garlic, cayenne pepper, capers, and olive slices. Cook 3 to 4 minutes longer.\nStir in tomatoes, herbes de Provence, and anchovy paste. Simmer for 10 minutes.\nAdd Barilla(R) Traditional pasta sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes. If sauce seems too thick, add a few tablespoons of reserved pasta cooking water. Serve over pasta.",
