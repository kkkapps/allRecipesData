Add dry ingredients to sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk and vinegar.  Mix well with an electric mixer for 2 to 3 minutes.\nPour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes or until  cookie feels firm.\nAfter cooling, cut cookie into 2 inch bars. Roll each bar in sugar and store in covered tins. This one of my favorite Christmas  cookie recipes.  Enjoy!!",
