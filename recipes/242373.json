    "ins": "About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine all ingredients in small bowl; mix well.   Pat ribs dry with paper towels; generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce. Combine all ingredients in medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes until slightly thickened, stirring frequently. Cool to room temperature; cover and refrigerate.\nHeat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 to 300 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.\nPlace the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours.  Spray both sides of ribs with tamarind juice.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.\nContinue cooking ribs for 1 to 2 hours more until very tender, spraying with tamarind juice every 30 minutes.  Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.\nMove ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with sauce.  Cook for about 5 minutes until sauce is set.  Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce.\nServe ribs with remaining sauce.",
