    "des": "\"These green plantains are mashed and mixed with peanut butter, salt and then baked.  Delicious!  This is a South American dish that I usually serve with eggs for breakfast.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nPlace plantain chunks and salt into a saucepan, and add water to cover plantains. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until a fork will easily pierce the plantains, about 20 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water, then drain the plantains. Allow to steam for a few minutes.\nMash the plantain with the peanut butter and reserved water until fine. Allow to cool until you can handle it, then roll into 24 golf ball-sized pieces. Place onto prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until the balls firm up, and turn golden brown, about 45 minutes.",
