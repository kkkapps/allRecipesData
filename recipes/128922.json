    "des": "\"I could never find the right oyster stuffing recipe, so I made my own with bacon, onion, mushrooms, and oysters. It is great with grilled turkey.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve drippings in the skillet.\nAdd the butter to the bacon drippings and melt over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, garlic, and mushrooms in the butter and drippings until the onion has caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the wine into the skillet; allow the wine to warm; remove from heat.\nPlace the stuffing cubes in a large bowl. Pour the vegetable mixture over the cubes. Add the chicken stock. Fold the oysters into the mixture. Transfer the stuffing to a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.",
