    "des": "\"Meyer lemons, a cross between a lemon and an orange, have a sweeter, less acidic flavor than the more common lemon. If you have to use a regular lemon, add a little extra sugar to taste. For the ultimate martini, use good quality vodka and orange liqueur. I should have named this the 'come to mama' martini!\"",
    "ins": "Combine 2 teaspoons sugar and warm water in a cocktail shaker; stir to dissolve sugar. Pour Meyer lemon juice, lemon peels, vodka, and orange liqueur into the shaker; add ice. Cover and shake vigorously.\nRemove a lemon peel from the shaker and wipe the rim of a martini glass with the peel. Dip the rim of the glass in 1 teaspoon sugar, or as needed. Strain martini into prepared glass.",
