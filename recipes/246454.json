Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nBeat butter and honey together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs and mix well.

Roll dough into small balls, about 1 heaping teaspoon each.\nPour hemp seeds into a bowl and press each dough ball into the seeds, coating half of each ball. Transfer dough balls to the baking sheet, gently pressing to 1/4-inch thickness.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 20 minutes.",
