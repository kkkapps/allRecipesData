    "des": "\"A classic French-Canadian sweet. Along with rice pudding and gelatin, this is one of the most commonly offered desserts in diners. Contrary to the usual recipe, this one uses milk for a more cake-like texture.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nSift the flour and baking powder together in a small bowl. Beat the egg, sugar, and 1/4 cup margarine together in a large bowl. Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk to the egg mixture, stirring just to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared dish.\nBring the water to a boil in a saucepan; stir the brown sugar, 1/4 cup margarine, and vanilla extract into the water and return to a boil for 2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until the center is set, about 45 minutes.",
