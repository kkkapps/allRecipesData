    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix dry ingredients and set aside.\n Cream sugars, butter or margarine and vanilla.  Beat in eggs and when smooth add dry ingredients.\nNext add the coconut followed by the marshmallows and finally the chips.  They will break up the marshmallows with the beater action.\nDrop small scoop onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake 10 minutes and remove from oven.  Let sit on tray for several minutes to let the marshmallows dry.  This will make it easier to get off the tray.  Store in a tight-fitted container.",
