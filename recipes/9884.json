    "des": "\"Great, creamy brownies. Freeze great. Wonderful to give as Christmas presents to teachers and friends.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour four 8x8-inch baking pans.\nPlace the chocolate chips and the coffee granules in a double boiler over simmering water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs two at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla, cinnamon, and salt, then mix in the melted chocolate. Mix in flour until just blended. Divide the batter equally into the prepared pans, and spread smooth.\nBake for 35 minutes in preheated oven, or until the edges pull from the sides of the pans. Cool on a wire rack. Cover, and refrigerate for 8 hours. Cut the cold brownies into bars to serve.",
