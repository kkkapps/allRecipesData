    "des": "\"Almost like a fruit cake without the fruit, very rich and the older it gets the better it tastes!! Pecans can be substituted for walnuts.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and flour in a bowl.\nAdd sausage, coffee, sugars, and eggs to the dry ingredients. Add raisins and nuts. Pour into an ungreased angel food cake pan.\nBake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour or till a toothpick comes out clean.\nGarnishes may be added such as drizzled white frosting with whole cherries and mint leaves. This cake is so moist. If you like the flavor of rum you can wrap a rum-soaked damp cloth around it and refrigerate for several weeks. Best served with a spoonful of whipped cream.",
