    "des": "\"Potato salad is the first food I can remember eating. Since it was my first culinary memory I am very particular about how I like my potato salad made. Basically, there's my mom's recipe, which is perfect, and every other version. So while I usually don't stray from what I consider 'real' potato salad, once in a while I will mix it up and try something new.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water until cool enough to handle. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir white and light green onion pieces until soft and slightly golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, stir, and remove skillet from heat.\nStir potatoes, green onion-garlic mixture, dark green onion pieces, yogurt, yellow mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until evenly combined.",
