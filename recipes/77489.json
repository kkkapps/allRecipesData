    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace chicken and potatoes into a large bowl. Pour olive oil over them, and stir to coat. Scatter the chicken and potato pieces in a large baking dish, or cookie sheet with sides. Sprinkle with rosemary, oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, uncovered. Baste during the last 15 minutes for extra crispness.",
