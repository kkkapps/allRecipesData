    "des": "\"The applesauce stuffing is a very nice change, and oh so moist and flavorful. You can also do this with pork chops if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking pan with cooking spray.\nIn a large bowl, mix the bread crumbs, onion, celery, applesauce, and broth. Season with parsley, rosemary, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. Transfer to the baking dish. Arrange chicken pieces in the dish so they are partially covered with the stuffing. Drizzle with butter. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\nBake 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove foil, and continue baking 30 minutes, until chicken juices run clear and stuffing is lightly browned.",
