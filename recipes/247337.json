    "ins": "Whisk eggs together in a deep container. Pour bread crumbs in another deep container.\nDip each slice of eggplant into the eggs, covering both sides, and press into the bread crumbs until evenly coated.\nSpray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Arrange a layer of eggplant slices in the skillet; cook until crispy, 2 to 4 minutes. Spray tops with cooking spray and flip; continue cooking until second side is browned and eggplant is tender, 2 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining slices.\nPreheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nArrange a layer of eggplant slices in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top each slice with a basil leaf, 1 tomato slice, and 1 slice of mozzarella cheese. Place another eggplant slice on top. Cover with remaining tomato and mozzarella cheese slices.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is softened, but not melted, about 5 minutes.",
