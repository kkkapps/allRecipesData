    "des": "\"Fresh peaches with creamy avocado, bell pepper, onions, and jalapeno make a great summertime salsa. Use as a topper for grilled fish or chicken, or just dip tortilla chips in it. Not a fan of avocados? The salsa is just as great without it. The longer it can marinate, the better it is.\"",
    "ins": "Gently mix peaches, jalapeno pepper, red onion, red bell pepper, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, and lemon juice in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Fold avocado into the salsa to serve.",
