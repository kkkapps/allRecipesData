    "des": "\"This one is a salad that has a great combination of sweet and sour.  It is great with chicken or any simple entree. I am always trying to make up new, crazy, salads and this one has been a work in process for 10 years.  The fresh dill is not a necessity if you have a hard time finding it but if you do care to splurge on fresh herbs, it adds a great flavor!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk the honey mustard, and balsamic vinegar together in a small bowl until combined. Drizzle in the olive oil while whisking to make the dressing; set aside.\nPlace the salad greens, tomatoes, strawberries, walnuts, and feta cheese into a large salad bowl. Tear off the dill fronds and add to the salad. Toss gently to mix, then pour on the dressing, and toss to coat.",
