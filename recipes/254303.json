Heat over medium heat until hot or heat electric griddle to 400 degrees F. Pour about 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle for each pancake. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbles form on top and bottom is golden brown. Turn and cook side until golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter.\nDrizzle each serving with 1 tablespoon honey; top with fresh fruit. Serve immediately.",
