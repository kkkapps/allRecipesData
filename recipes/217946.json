    "des": "\"This sandwich happened when I had a bacon craving and not much else in the house.  I found a few things that didn't seem to match up, but I put them together anyway and the result was much better than I could have imagined.\"",
    "ins": "Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, keeping the drippings in the skillet; reduce heat to medium.\nCombine the apple, kale, tandoori seasoning, cayenne pepper, and apple cider with the drippings in the hot skillet. Drizzle the oil over the apple mixture; cook and stir until the kale begins to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\nDivide the kale mixture between the bottom halves of the dinner rolls. Top with the bacon and the Asiago cheese; finish the sandwiches by topping with the top halves of the rolls.",
