    "ins": "Cook ravioli according to package directions.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce.  In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over a medium high heat.  Add tomatoes, artichokes, scallions, garlic, and salt and pepper.  Cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are warmed through.  Remove from heat.\nDrain pasta well.  Transfer to a large bowl, and toss with 1 teaspoon oil.  Add half of the sauce to the ravioli; toss gently, but thoroughly to mix.  Transfer ravioli to a large serving platter.  Pour remaining vegetable sauce over ravioli.  Garnish with Parmesan cheese.",
