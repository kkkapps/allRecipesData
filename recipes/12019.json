    "des": "\"This is a great quick meal; the chicken and sauce can be prepared in the time it takes to cook the pasta. You can add more cream or less pasta if you like it creamier. Try ziti or farfalle pasta to add even more variety to this recipe. The leftovers don't heat very well, so eat it all up the first time!\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot with boiling salted water cook rotini pasta until al dente. Drain.\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet melt the butter or margarine. Add the chopped chicken and garlic, saute until lightly brown and juices run clear. Stir in the ground black pepper, dried basil, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese. Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.\nToss drained pasta with basil sauce and serve immediately.",
