    "des": "\"Fonio is boiled with toasted black sesame seeds for a side dish or a gluten-free substitute for couscous. I was given this recipe by a Senegalese grocer after I complained about not liking the millet version of couscous and the high cost of quinoa. This tiny African grain is bursting with nutrition and health benefits and is so easy to cook. There are many ways to prepare fonio, but this is the recipe I prefer for ease and taste.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a small skillet. Add sesame seeds; toast until fragrant, about 6 minutes.\nBring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in toasted sesame seeds, fonio, and salt. Bring water back to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until water has been absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff fonio with a fork.",
