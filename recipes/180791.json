    "des": "\"These spicy burgers are full of flavor and smell amazing. They stand on their own, but onions or roasted peppers give them even more of a kick! Ground chicken also works great if you want to substitute the turkey.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the egg, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in a large mixing bowl until the egg is well blended. Add the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cumin, mustard, paprika, chili powder, salt, bread crumbs, and turkey; mix well and form into 6 patties.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCook the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve on the toasted hamburger buns.",
