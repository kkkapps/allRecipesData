    "des": "\"Spinach toast is what happens when you have some leftover creamed spinach that you don't want to throw away. And as you know, a cook is only as good as his or her leftovers. This makes a super-nice, easy lunch.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nBrush the lighter sides of the toast with olive oil. Place the toast pieces onto the prepared baking sheet with oiled sides down.\nSpoon leftover creamed spinach onto the toast slices, spreading the spinach all the way to the edges. Top each with a sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn on the oven's broiler and broil spinach toasts until the cheese is lightly browned, about 2 more minutes.",
