    "des": "\"The key here is to brown whatever fungi you happen to choose in a good amount of brown butter. Then, when you add the pinot noir, the wine will glaze the surface rather than soak into the mushrooms. The fat sort of makes the flesh wine-proof, and everybody wins.\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter in a skillet over medium-low heat until light brown. Stir in mushrooms with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until mushrooms shrink and are almost tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in black pepper. Pour in wine and cook, stirring, until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.",
