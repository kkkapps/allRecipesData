    "des": "\"This pasta dish is always a best-seller at Italian restaurants, but very few people try to make it at home. The sauce only takes about 10 minutes to put together. By then your pasta will be cooked and you'll be ready to enjoy this classic dish.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.\nCombine cream, clams with juice, garlic, and anchovies in a large pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer and remove from heat. Add red pepper flakes and stir.\nBeat egg yolk in a small bowl. Add one spoonful hot cream mixture to egg and stir. Repeat twice. Pour egg yolk mixture into cream mixture and stir.\nAdd cooked spaghetti to the cream mixture; stir to coat the pasta, cover the pot, and let sit until flavors combine and pasta soaks up some of the sauce, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top and season with salt. Ladle pasta into bowls; top with croutons and basil.",
