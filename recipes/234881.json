    "des": "\"Nothing tastes better than tequila and jalapeno; the cucumber adds a freshness that helps to mute the jalapeno's bite. The longer it chills, the more jalapeno and cucumber infuses into the tequila. Serve over ice in a salt-rimmed glass, garnished with cucumber slices.\"",
    "ins": "Stir tequila, lime juice, orange liqueur, and simple syrup together in a pitcher with a lid; add jalapeno pepper and thin cucumber slices. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.\nRun a wedge of lime along the rim of each of four pint glasses. Spread kosher salt onto a flat plate; press glass rims into salt to coat. Fill glass with ice and pour margarita over the ice. Garnish with cucumber slice.",
