    "des": "\"These butter-soaked bourbon-glazed carrots are the greatest special-occasion carrot side dish of all time. Sweet, savory, and oh so glossy.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.\nWhen butter foams up, add carrots. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until liquid from carrots  evaporates and carrots begin to brown around the edges, 5 or 6 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Carefully pour in bourbon. Cook and stir until bourbon is almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.\nSprinkle in brown sugar. Stir until carrots are almost cooked through, about 5 minutes.\nWhen carrots are nearly tender, raise heat to medium-high to thicken the glaze, 15 to 30 seconds.\nSeason with cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Transfer to serving dish and garnish with fresh thyme leaves, if desired.",
