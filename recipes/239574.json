    "des": "\"Great recipe for any time of the day. I got the idea from another Allrecipes.com recipe, but made several modifications that turned it into an almost-different dish.\n\n The addition of orange juice, apples, and vanilla makes this a tasty breakfast treat. These are best when a little crispy.\"",
    "ins": "Stir rolled oats, chickpea flour, oat bran, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Stream water into the flour mixture while stirring into a batter, avoiding it becoming too watery.\nStir apple, orange juice, and vanilla extract into batter.\nLightly grease a griddle and heat it until drops of water sprinkled on it evaporate noisily. Ladle batter onto griddle in about 1/2 cup portions, dust with cinnamon, and cook until bubbles begin to form on top, 3 to 5 minutes; flip and continue cooking until bottom side is a golden brown color, 2 to 3 minutes more.",
