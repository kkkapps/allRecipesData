    "des": "\"A simple and easily adjusted broiled open face sandwich concoction. You can use beef, ham, turkey, chicken, etc. You can also adjust the veggies. Just make sure the cheese is always on top to pull it together. The combined flavors of the ingredients that I've listed blows my mind every time I make this. Eat with a knife and fork!\"",
