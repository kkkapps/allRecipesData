    "des": "\"Mulled cranberry cider, like mulled wine, is a cold-weather tradition in my home.  This warm, comforting drink is easy to prepare and is a great finale for a holiday meal.  This recipe is for 2 quarts, which will serve up to 6 to 8 people; the amounts can be multiplied without any problems.\"",
    "ins": "Pour cranberry juice into a slow cooker; set on high.  To the juice add the zest from the oranges, cloves, cranberries, vanilla extract, honey and cinnamon sticks.  Heat, stirring occasionally,  until hot and steamy, about 20 minutes.",
