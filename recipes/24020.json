    "ins": "Lightly flour a pastry cloth. Sift 1 1/2 cups flour with salt onto a board and make a well in the center. Add beaten egg mixed with 1/3 cup warm milk, 2 teaspoon melted butter and vinegar into center of the well. Depending on your flour you may have to add more milk.\nCombine the ingredients quickly with your fingers, working from the outside of the well, and when it is mixed, knead the dough on a board until the dough is pliable and silky and no longer sticks to the board. Brush the surface of the ball with melted butter and cover the dough with a warm bowl and let it rest 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nRoll it out on the board as thin as possible. Move it to the table. Begin to stretch the dough gently from the center out, trying not to tear it. It should stretch to about 1 yard square. A heavier edge of dough or a border will develop as you work, and whatever remains of this must be cut off with a knife before the filling is spread or the pastry rolled up. Fill pastry with ingredients and roll or fold over.\nBrush the surface with melted butter and bake 20 minutes, then lower temperature to 350 and brush again with melted butter. Bake for about 10 minutes longer or until browned.",
