    "des": "\"This recipe is a very traditional Moldovan recipe.  My mother and my grandmother used to cook it at almost every Moldovan holy day and sometimes on a casual day. I love it! If you cannot find parsley root, you may substitute parsnip or turnip.\"",
    "ins": "Place rice in a medium bowl, and pour boiling water over it. Let soak for 15 minutes, then drain.\nHeat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, parsley roots, onions and tomato paste. Cook and stir until the vegetables are tender. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the rice.\nHeat 2 more tablespoons of oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork, and cook for about 2 minutes, just until browned on the outside. Transfer to the bowl with the rice and vegetables; season with dill and black pepper. Stir until everything is well blended. Set the mixture aside to cool.\nCarefully remove the leaves from the head of cabbage, and place them in a large pot with about 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until tender and flexible.\nRemove the cabbage leaves from the pot, but leave enough in the bottom to cover. On each of the remaining leaves, place about 2 tablespoons of the pork and rice mixture in the center, and wrap the leaf around to cover. Place the stuffed cabbage leaves into the pot.\nWhen the pot is full, place a few boiled cabbage leaves over the top. Pour boiling water into the pot to cover the cabbage rolls, and place over medium-low heat.  Cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the rice is tender.",
