Her book is older than I am. Anyway this is simply the best pancake recipe I've ever tried. I have tried a few, but always come back to this one.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the brown sugar, white sugar, baking powder, milk, egg, olive oil, and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour 1/2 cup at a time until the batter reaches the desired thickness. The batter should look like cake batter (not too thin, but not too thick).\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side.",
