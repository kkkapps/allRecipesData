    "des": "\"An ice box cookie, these were one of the two Christmas cookie recipes my German grandmother made every year until her death at age 92. While they may not be fancy like  other Christmas cookies recipes, they are easy to make and taste very nutty. They make me think of Christmas and my grandmother every time I enjoy one.\"",
    "ins": "Beat the butter, sugar, egg, and salt together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in the flour and baking soda, and mix just until blended. Mix in the hazelnuts.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape into 2 1/2 inch log. Wrap snugly in wax paper, and refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.\nUnwrap, and cut the log into 1/8 inch thick slices. Place on prepared baking sheets 2 inches apart. Brush tops with beaten egg and, if desired, decorate with sprinkles.\nBake in preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on racks, and store in an airtight tin.",
