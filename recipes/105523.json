    "des": "\"This is a very authentic Indian recipe found on Indian menus the world over. It is served during formal dinners, festivals and weddings. Generally it is made with cream or 'malai' as it is called, but I have given a low calorie version which is equally tempting. Making it may sound tedious, but let me tell you it's worth the effort!  Get ready to impress your loved ones, with this recipe you just can't go wrong!\"",
