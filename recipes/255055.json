    "des": "\"A very tender recipe and very simple. I made this up myself and gave it a little decoration--you can use toothpicks, honey, and nuts. \nThe recipe is doubled because I had made half the amount and that wasn't enough so I doubled it and then I made enough.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.\nBeat sugar and butter together in a bowl; mix in eggs until combined.\nCombine flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a bowl; stir into egg mixture. Mix in vanilla extract. Stir in coconut and 4 teaspoons cinnamon. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan with a spatula.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan, about 20 minutes; cut into squares.\nPlace toothpicks, honey, walnuts, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon onto waxed paper. Dip a toothpick into honey; draw desired design onto the brownies with honey-dipped toothpick. Sprinkle with walnuts and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.",
