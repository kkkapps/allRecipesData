    "des": "\"One could substitute graham cracker crumbs for the vanilla wafers, and fruit cocktail for the fruit called for in this recipe. It's a great dessert and one my mother made when I was a kid, well over 25 years ago! This was one of the recipes I copied from my mom's collection when I left home for the first time! This pie contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, children, the elderly, and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.\"",
