    "ins": "Spread 2 slices of bread with the mustard.  Layer each with 3 slices of ham, half of the pear slices, a dash of pepper, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.  Top with remaining bread.  Lightly spread margarine on the outer sides of each sandwich.\nHeat a skillet or griddle over medium heat.  Grill the sandwiches until the cheese is melted and the bread is golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Cut each sandwich in half to serve.",
