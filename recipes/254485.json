    "des": "\"Green garlic has a brief spring window for you to enjoy, so caramelizing it on a grill allows you to make the most of its mellow flavors! Spread warm garlic on toasted bread or crackers with cheese, mix into mashed potatoes, salad dressings or sauces, or use it in a baba ganoush.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nPlace garlic bulbs on large sheets of aluminum foil, up to 3 bulbs per sheet. Lightly drizzle olive oil over bulbs and season with salt and pepper. Wrap foil tightly around bulbs.\nPlace bulbs inside the preheated grill on the top rack away from the flames; cook until garlic cloves are butter-soft, about 30 minutes. Allow garlic bulbs to cool until easily handled. Squeeze garlic from bulb into a bowl and mash with a fork until spreadable.",
