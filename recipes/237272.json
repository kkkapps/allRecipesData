    "des": "\"This Easter breakfast frittata has been a family tradition going back many generations from Italy. You probably want to make several at a time because they are time-consuming, but well worth it! Slice as you would a pie and enjoy right away, or cover with aluminum foil and freeze in a freezer bag until needed (that's why I make 4 at a time). Serve with fruit or tomatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace farmer's cheese in 1 bowl and mozzarella cheese in a separate bowl.\nCombine sausage, salami, and pepperoni in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir until warmed, about 5 minutes. Stir ricotta cheese into meat mixture until melted and stringy, about 5 minutes. Stir farmer's cheese and mozzarella cheese into meat mixture until warmed, about 5 minutes.\nBlend eggs together in a blender until frothy; pour into meat-cheese mixture and stir until some of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Pour egg mixture into a 9-inch pie pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until top has risen and is starting to brown, about 20 minutes. Cool frittata on a wire rack until set, at least 5 minutes.",
