    "des": "\"This recipe yields a bread that's moist and savory and tastes distinctly of corn. Unlike many corn muffins, these stay moist, thanks to canned creamed corn.\"",
    "ins": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 12-cup muffin tin (with standard-sized molds of 12-cup capacity) in oven to heat while preparing batter.\nMicrowave creamed corn in a 1-quart Pyrex-type measuring cup to a full boil (or in a medium saucepan over medium heat). Stir in 1 cup of the cornmeal to make a very thick, pasty mush. If the mush is not stiff, microwave an additional 30 seconds or so. Whisk in buttermilk, then eggs and finally butter.\nMix remaining cornmeal with flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and soda in a medium bowl. Pour wet ingredients into dry and stir until just combined.\nRemove muffin tin from oven; coat with non-stick cooking spray. Divide batter evenly among cups (a spring-action ice cream scoop works well).\nBake until golden brown on sides and bottom, about 15 minutes. Turn onto a wire rack; let cool 5 minutes. Serve.",
