    "des": "\"This is a spicy stew with goat's meat as a main ingredient. Serve over rice, funchi or potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the water, lime juice, and goat meat in a large container. Let stand for 10 minutes, then drain the meat in a colander, and squeeze out as much water as possible.\nHeat the canola oil in a large skillet until smoking over medium-high heat. Add the drained goat meat, and cook until browned all over, about 7 minutes. Stir in the onion and bell pepper, cook until the onion has softened, about 3 minutes, then stir in the tomato paste. Pour in the water, vinegar, and soy sauce; season with nutmeg, paprika, salt, and pepper.\nBring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to prevent sticking.",
