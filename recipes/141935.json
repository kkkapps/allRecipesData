    "ins": "Place the apples in a medium serving bowl and sprinkle with sugar, lemon juice and salt. Stir in the celery, dates and walnuts. In a separate bowl, whip the cream with an electric mixer until it can hold a peak. Mix in mayonnaise and gently fold into the apple mixture along with the marshmallows. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.",
