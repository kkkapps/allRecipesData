With food processor running, add yogurt slowly until a moist dough forms. Transfer dough to the greased pan and spread evenly to 1/2-inch thickness.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges start to come away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C) and bake until top is toasted and golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Cut into 1x3-inch bars while still warm.",
