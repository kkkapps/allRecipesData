Stir peas and cornstarch into steak mixture; cook uncovered until liquid thickens, about 10 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Serve beef mixture over noodles.",
