    "des": "\"I didn't start out trying to make a creamy zucchini recipe, but when I glanced in the fridge and saw the last crumbled remains of fresh cream cheese, I knew those green cubes sizzling away in the skillet were about to get enriched.

Cook for about 2 minutes.\nStir in salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir until zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes.\nStir cream cheese into zucchini mixture; cook until cream cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in oregano.",
