Drain the water and transfer the vegetables to a medium bowl.\nTo the bowl add the peas, mushrooms, onions, chicken soup and mushroom soup. Cube the cooked turkey breasts and stir into the mixture. Mix together well and spread the mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish. Top with the coarsely crushed saltine crackers.\nCover and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes.",
