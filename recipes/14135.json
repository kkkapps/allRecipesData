    "ins": "Mix the blackberry juice and sugar, bring to a boil.  Boil rapidly for 2 minutes.  Skim off foam.  Pour into HOT sterile jars or bottles.\nThis makes a thin syrup (like true maple syrup).  If you want it slightly thicker, you can add a small amount of powdered pectin (less than half a 2 ounce box) to the cold syrup and sugar mixture.",
