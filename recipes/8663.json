Remove chicken meat from the bones and cut into small pieces.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the flour and cook for about 1 minute. Slowly stir in the cold milk and chicken stock; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and stir in the cheese.\nStir the cooked chicken, rice, and mushrooms into the cheese sauce and season with salt and pepper. Pour mixture into a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.\nBake in preheated oven until mixture is hot and bubbly and beginning to brown on top, about 30 minutes.",
