    "des": "\"Quick, easy and definitely delicious. Spicy sausage and creamy cavatelli is tossed with tangy broccoli rabe in a delicate chicken and wine sauce. I also use gnocchi in place of the cavatelli on occasion.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatelli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain.\nFill the same pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Add broccoli rabe; cook until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain.\nHeat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and onion; cook and stir until sausage is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in broccoli rabe, roasted red peppers, and garlic. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.\nDissolve chicken stock with white wine and water in a small bowl. Whisk in cornstarch. Pour chicken stock mixture into the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Bring sauce to a simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nPour sauce over cooked cavatelli and top with Parmesan cheese. Toss lightly and serve.",
