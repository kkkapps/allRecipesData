    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine flour, salt, and black pepper in a resealable plastic bag; place beef into bag in batches, shaking to coat.\nHeat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate. Pour red wine into Dutch oven, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Return beef cubes to Dutch oven and add water, tomato soup, potatoes, corn, onion, beef stock concentrate, mushrooms, carrots, celery, vegetable soup mix, and basil; bring to a boil.\nCover and transfer Dutch oven to preheated oven; bake for about 1 hour. Add beef stock to pot, if needed. Continue to bake until beef is very tender, about 1 hour more.",
