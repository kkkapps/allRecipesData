    "des": "\"Legend has it that the Sloppy Joe was first created in Sioux City, Iowa in 1930 by a cook named Joe. We think Joe would love this creamy, cheesy, game day dip! Season ground beef with McCormick\u00c2\u00ae Sloppy Joes Seasoning Mix for authentic flavor. Add cream cheese, tomato sauce, onions, and Cheddar Jack cheese to beef. Bake until ooey-gooey and garnish with dill pickle slices. Tangy, sweet and savory, it's best enjoyed loaded on top of potato chips.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\nBrown ground beef and onion in large skillet on medium-high heat, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Stir in broth, seasoning mix, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes or until stock is absorbed, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.\nStir 1 cup of the shredded cheese and cream cheese into the beef mixture. Spoon into a 2-quart baking dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup shredded cheese.\nBake 10 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve with wavy potato chips or mini toasts.",
