    "des": "\"Tofu Miso Tahini is a delectable vegan sandwich filling. You can replace the sunflower seeds with sesame seeds if you prefer. You'll never want tuna or chicken salad again!!!  Try TMT on an open-faced, toasted bagel with ripe tomato slices, on a seed-laden, whole wheat bread with lettuce and sweet onion, or on rye crackers as an hors d'oeurve, garnished with fine slices of vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Press tofu to remove excess water:  Place tofu on a flat surface.  Cover with a cutting board, and place an iron skillet or a similarly heavy object on top.  Allow it to sit for about 30 minutes.\nCrumble tofu into a medium bowl.  Mix in miso and tahini.  If desired, stir in onion, carrot, and seeds. Refrigerate.",
