    "des": "\"This very filling stew is a delicious way to use up all those leftover veggies in the fridge. Feel free to adjust the amount of green chiles in the stew according to the level of spiciness you prefer.  Serve over cooked rice or with a tortilla.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic, onion, carrots, celery, potatoes, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown, about 10 minutes.\nToss yellow squash, spinach leaves, corn, pinto beans, and spaghetti squash into the pot. Continue to stir until spinach leaves have wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.\nPour vegetable broth, water, and green chiles into the mixture. If necessary, add more water to make sure vegetables are covered. Bring stew to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.",
