    "des": "\"Puff pastry cookies wrapped on clothes pins, baked and then filled.  1/2 inch to 5/8 inch dowels cut 4 inches long work well.  Clothes pins may spring open in the oven and break the pastry.  These are best if baked on insulated cookie sheets.\"",
    "ins": "Mix 1/4 pound of the butter with 3 cups of flour, 2 tablespoons white sugar, egg yolks, and water.  (Done like making pie dough with a pastry blender.)\nChill for 1 hour then roll out like pie dough on a floured pastry sheet.  Spread another 1/4 pound of the butter over dough.  Fold dough together and refrigerate 1 hour.  Repeat this procedure until all of the butter is used.\nCut dough into fourths.  Wrap each quarter in plastic wrap.  Chill.\nTake out one quarter at a time and  allow to stand at room temperature long enough that it softens enough that the dough can be rolled.\nRoll dough out on floured pastry sheet/ board.  Cut dough  into 1/2 inch wide X 4-5 inch long strips.  Wrap around clothes pins or dowel pins pinching ends.\nBake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned.  Slide off sticks while still very warm and then cool completely.\nTo Make Filling:  In a saucepan over medium heat, cook 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup flour until thick stirring constantly. Let cool.\nCream together shortening, confectioners' sugar,  marshmallow cream, and vanilla.  Add cooked mixture to creamed mixture and beat till fluffy.  Fill cooled pastry curls with filling.",
