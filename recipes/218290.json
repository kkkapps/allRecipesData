    "des": "\"Not for the faint of heart.  This hearty chili strives to excite all the taste buds.  Each bite is at first sweet, and then 'blossoms' into a slow burn that begs for the next bite. Use coarsely sliced jalapeno, so that the less adventuresome can easily identify and scoop them out. Serve with fresh grated sharp process white Cheddar and warm garlic bread.  Serve leftovers on hot dogs - yes, beans and all.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, red bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until the onion is tender, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, maple syrup, and kidney beans. Season with black pepper and chili powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.\nMeanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Sprinkle beef with salt. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease; stir into the chili along with 1 beer. Cook and stir for 1 hour, stirring frequently. Season to taste with salt, and thin to desired consistency with 1 beer before serving.",
