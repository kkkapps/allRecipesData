    "des": "\"A meal designed by necessity before the morning shift at my pizzeria. Cook time is extremely quick and the product is strangely satisfying. This dish would be complemented with a tall glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice and a hot mug of black coffee. Serves about one hungry human.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to cool.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken and garbanzo beans to onion mixture; cook and stir until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.\nMix spinach and eggs into chicken mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set and cooked through, about 5 minutes.\nPlace pasta in a serving bowl and top with egg mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and feta cheese over egg mixture.",
