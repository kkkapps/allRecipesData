    "des": "\"Japanese marinade sauce gives a lovely taste and texture to broiled mackerel. Yellow tail, tuna or salmon are also good for this recipe. Easy, exotic!\"",
    "ins": "Rinse fillets, and pat dry with paper towels. In a medium bowl, mix together the soy sauce, mirin, sugar and fresh ginger. Place fillets into the marinade, and let stand for at least 20 minutes.\nPreheat your ovens broiler, or an outdoor grill for high heat. Broil the fillets, basting occasionally, until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 to 8 minutes. Serve with a lemon slice or long white radish slice as a garnish.",
