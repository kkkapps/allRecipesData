    "des": "\"Traditionally a long-simmered stew, this Mexican-inspired stew is quick and easy, thanks to canned hominy. Searing the pork loin in the pot before making the stew gives you a great base of flavors so the stew seems as if it indeed simmered all afternoon. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with warm tortillas on the side. Yum, yum, yum.\"",
    "ins": "Season pork with salt and pepper.\nHeat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and return pot to heat.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Cook and stir onion and 2 tablespoons water in hot pot until water has evaporated and onion is soft and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, serrano peppers, cumin, and coriander; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nStir 2 cups water, chicken broth, and tomatoes into onion mixture. Whisk in cornmeal and bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring often; add hominy, pork, salt, and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is soft and hominy mixture thickens, about 30 minutes. Stir in cilantro and lime juice.",
