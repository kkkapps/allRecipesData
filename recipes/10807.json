    "des": "\"A simple 3 ingredient rolled dough, with pastry filling.  They are my most popular cookies to make.  Everyone young and old loves them. Sprinkle with powered sugar.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together the flour, sour cream and butter or margarine in a large mixing bowl.\nFlour a pastry board and your hands.  Make dough into small balls or roll them into 2 inch squares.  Add a small amount of pastry filling, any flavor you like.  Fold dough diagonally and press together.  If you make balls, press a small rim around the outside so the filling does not seep out.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 minutes and sprinkle on confectioners' sugar.   A wonderful gift any time of the year.",
