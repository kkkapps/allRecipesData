    "des": "\"My mother is famous for this recipe!  It sounds like a weird combo of flavors but it is ohhhh so good! You can also bake them if you do not have a deep-fryer, but you won't get the same crunchiness.\"",
    "ins": "In a shallow dish, stir together the garlic, cinnamon and soy sauce. Place the pork chops in the mixture, and marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).\nFry pork chops in the hot oil until the juices run clear and they are crispy on the outside. This will only take about 2 minutes.",
