    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crusts in 2 pie plates. Roll out top crusts and set aside.\nCut sausage into 1 inch pieces. Heat a skillet over medium heat and cook sausage until brown. Place sausage in a large bowl, and add hard cooked eggs, Cheddar cheese, Provolone cheese, Ricotta cheese, and parsley. Mix together and season to taste with salt and pepper.\nAdd one raw egg to mixture. Mix well and check consistency - it should not be loose or runny, but should hold together well. Add one more raw egg if necessary.\nSpoon filling into 2 pastry-lined pie pans, and cover with other 2 pastry shells. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top. Brush top pastry with melted butter or margarine.\nBake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, until golden brown.",
