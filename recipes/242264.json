Transfer the mixture to a 9 x 9-inch or similar-sized baking dish. Cover with foil.\nBake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil, increase the temperature to 400 degrees F, and bake for another 20 minutes until the potatoes start to brown and crisp around the edges.\nRemove from oven, top with chopped spinach and serve.",
