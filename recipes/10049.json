    "des": "\"Old family recipe from my daughter-in-laws family in southern Mississippi. It is very good.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).\nCream the butter, sugar and eggs well.  Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly.\nPour batter into tart shells, no more than half full.  Bake for 20 - 25 minutes.  Watch carefully!!--they'll burn quickly.  Filling will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks or so.  Liquid coffee creamer can be used for cream.  Use any good pie pastry for shells.",
