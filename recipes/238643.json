    "des": "\"This is my go-to breakfast when I need a lot of energy and endurance! Depending how much energy you need, you can add more bananas and mangoes. You can also put an extra 1/2 cup romaine lettuce (or spinach) into the smoothie without changing the taste. If you really like chia seeds (like I do!), you can add an extra tablespoon. I often drink this after eating 1 ounce sunflower seeds or nuts just to complete the meal. Feel free to add or modify anything you please. Delicious and nutritious.\"",
    "ins": "Blend mango, banana, water, lettuce, ice, and flax seeds together in a blender until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add chia seeds to mango mixture and stir. Let sit until smoothie thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.",
