    "des": "\"This is an excellent dessert to bring for the Holidays.  You can use either Brandy or Rum.  These do need some time to set up so it is best to make them the night before. If you don't care for walnuts, the balls can be rolled in confectioners' sugar or cocoa powder.\"",
    "ins": "In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt evaporated milk and chocolate chips, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the crushed vanilla wafers and brandy until well blended. Roll the dough into small balls and roll the balls in chopped walnuts, then in confectioners' sugar. Store covered in the refrigerator.",
