Variations can definitely be made to taste...sometimes I use chicken (boneless or not)...sometimes I use shrimp...sometimes I use both. My family makes it with chicken innards (gizzards, heart, etc.) which I'm not too keen on eating. Hey, but with this soup it's to each his or her own.\"",

Place the chicken in the pot, and cook until lightly browned.\nPuree the cilantro, garlic, and 1/3 cup water in a blender or food processor. Mix into the pot with the chicken and onions. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until mixed and heated through. Pour enough water into the pot to cover all ingredients.\nMix the hominy, rice, and bouillon into the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. Increase the amount of water as needed to attain desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.",
