    "des": "\"A beautiful cake for the strawberry lover. Easy to make with packaged gelatin and white cake mix. Fresh strawberries can be used when they are in season.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake pans.\nIn a large bowl, dissolve the gelatin in cold water; stir in the cake mix, eggs, vegetable oil, flour and 1/2 of the strawberries.  Beat for 5 minutes on the medium speed of an electric mixer.  Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.\nBake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the layers spring back when lightly pressed in the center.  Cool cakes in the pans on wire racks.\nTo Make Frosting:  Cream the butter, sugar and the remaining half of the strawberries in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, adding additional confectioners' sugar if needed for a spreadable consistency.  Spread the frosting between layers and over the top and sides of cake.",
