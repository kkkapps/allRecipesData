    "des": "\"This is a very nice, light textured multigrain bread that uses many different grains and seeds and very easy to make if you have a food processor. I used my Ninja\u00c2\u00ae with the plastic blade attachment.\"",
    "ins": "Mix warm water and sugar together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; stir in yeast. Set aside until a creamy foam starts to form, about 5 minutes.\nCombine bread flour, whole wheat flour, coconut oil, and salt in a food processor; pulse 4 times. Add chia seeds, wheat germ, flax seeds, millet, 1 tablespoon hemp seeds, 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds, and 1 tablespoon oats; pulse until incorporated.\nPour yeast mixture over flour mixture in the food processor; process until a dough ball forms, about 1 minute.\nTurn dough into a well-oiled large bowl and cover with a damp towel; allow to rise in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nPunch dough down and knead a few times. Form dough into an oblong shape and place in a greased bread pan. Lightly press the remaining hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, and oats onto the loaf. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm area for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until cooked through and crust is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Cool bread in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
