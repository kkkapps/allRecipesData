    "des": "\"Chicken breasts stuffed with soft cheese, wrapped in bacon, and drizzled with honey. Very easy and tastes amazing. I have lost count of the amount of times I have made this. It's a family favourite, and goes very well with either roasted vegetables, such as aubergine, peppers, courgettes, etc., & sauteed potatoes or salad and potato salad.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut a slit in each chicken breast, and stuff with equal amounts Boursin cheese. Wrap each breast with 2 slices bacon. Secure with toothpicks. Arrange on a baking sheet.\nBake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken juices run clear. Drizzle breasts with equal amounts of honey during the final 5 minutes of cook time.",
