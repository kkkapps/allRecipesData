    "des": "\"This is extremely flavorful. It actually surprised me as I was just testing to see if I could use pumpkin in a savory way like butternut squash soup. The coconut milk makes it thicker and creamy tasting like a bisque but there is no dairy in the soup. Also I used chicken stock, I love the flavor but I'm sure vegetable stock would work very well too. Can be a vegan recipe if you take out the chicken stock and use water or vegetable stock instead.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in pumpkin puree and coconut milk; add broth until desired consistency is reached.\nStir thyme, salt, paprika, garlic powder, and herbes de Provence into pumpkin mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors combine, 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
