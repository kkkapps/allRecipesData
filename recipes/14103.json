Spoon 1/4 of the potato mixture onto the slice of bread. Roll the bread into a cylinder. Seal the edges together by pinching the ends with your fingers, use more water if it is necessary to keep the bread sealed. Do the same with the remaining 3 slices of bread.\nPour the three tablespoons of oil into a large frying pan or wok. Heat the oil to a high heat. Place  the bread rolls into the hot oil and fry until crispy.",
