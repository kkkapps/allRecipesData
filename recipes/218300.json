    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, mix the canola oil, ranch dressing mix, dill, lemon pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, seasoned salt, and white pepper until thoroughly combined. Gently mix the crackers with the seasonings, tossing to coat the crackers with the seasoned oil. Spread the crackers out onto a jelly roll pan in a single layer.\nBake in the preheated oven until the crackers are very lightly browned at the edges, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring to bake other sides halfway through cooking. Allow to cool completely before storing in airtight canister or resealable plastic bag.",
