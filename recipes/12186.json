Whatever amount of flour you need, you then take HALF that amount for your lard and margarine.  Motto \"Half as much fat as flour.\" Do as the English do and use half lard and half margarine for the shortening.\"",
    "ins": "Cut the shortening into cubes, and toss into flour.  Take your hands and crumble it up into a fine, pebbly, grainy sort of dough.\nAdd water, enough to make a soft dough.  Form into a ball, and chill for about an hour.\nWhen chilled, knead it a couple of times on a floured surface.  Roll it out, and proceed to fill with your choice of pie fillings.",
