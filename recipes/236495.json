    "des": "\"This is my grandmother's recipe for Peruvian beef empanada filling. Use homemade pie crust or, in a pinch, refrigerated pie crust to make these Peruvian turnovers. Lightly dust powdered sugar over the baked empanadas and serve with lime wedges for authentic flair.\"",
    "ins": "Stir flour into water in a small bowl until dissolved.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute onion in oil until softened, about 5 minutes; add ground beef, olives, cumin, and paprika. Cook and stir the beef mixture until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.\nPour flour-water mixture into the beef and stir to coat evenly. Add raisins, stir, and cook until the raisins are plump, about 5 minutes. Fold eggs into the beef mixture; season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool before using to fill empanadas.",
