    "des": "\"This Italian appetizer made of bread, fresh spinach, and some other goodies is great for serving at parties. A French baguette is a long, narrow loaf of French bread. I like to garnish the bruschetta with more basil.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange the bread slices on a non-stick cookie sheet.\nIn an electric blender or food processor combine the spinach, Parmesan, almonds, basil, garlic, salt and pepper. Blend until a paste forms. Pulse in 2 tablespoons olive oil; continue pulsing until the mixture is the consistency of soft butter.\nIn a small mixing bowl combine chopped tomatoes, green onion and 1 tablespoon olive oil; stir.\nBake the bread slices for 5 minutes or until crisp and brown.\nArrange toast on a serving platter. Spread each piece of toast with a thin layer of the blended pesto, then top with the tomato mixture.",
