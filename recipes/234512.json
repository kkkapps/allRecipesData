    "des": "\"I had a lot of chocolate chip cookies left over after Christmas, so I made this cake using the idea of a graham cracker cake. Putting everything into a food processor made it quick to make and clean up. It turned out to be a tasty treat topped with whipped cream. It is very moist and soft. Adding coconut or nuts gives it texture. Serve topped with whipped cream or dusted with powdered sugar.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan or baking dish.\nProcess chocolate chip cookies in a food processor until completely crumbled. Add sugar, flour, baking powder, and cinnamon to cookie crumbs; pulse to combine. Add butter, eggs, and vanilla to cookie mixture; process until blended.\nPour milk into cookie mixture while food processor is running; blend until batter is evenly mixed. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 to 15 minutes.",
