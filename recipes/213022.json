Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 1 hour.\nStir in the ham hocks, onion, celery, salt, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf; bring to a boil, cover the pot, and simmer until the ham hocks are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the okra and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf before serving.",
