    "ins": "Melt butter in a large skillet with olive oil over medium heat; place asparagus spears in the skillet.\nWhen asparagus starts to sizzle slightly, drizzle in the hot pepper sauce and add almonds, Italian seasoning, and onion to the skillet.\nMove the asparagus around in the skillet with a spoon to expose almonds and onion to the butter and oil; cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and season with salt and black pepper.\nSprinkle asparagus with Parmesan cheese and heat until cheese melts, about 5 more minutes.",
