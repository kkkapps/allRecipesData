    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until it has begun to brown. Add the bay leaves, salt, thyme, black pepper, caraway seeds, red onion, garlic, celery, potatoes, carrots, parsnips, apples, chicken stock, apple cider, and cider vinegar to the pot. There should be enough liquid to just cover the vegetables. If not, add more chicken stock to cover the vegetables.\nBring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and garnish with the parsley to serve.",
