    "des": "\"This is a really great cucumber salad that's light and flavorful and makes a great starter! Tastes fine as it is, but can be salted and peppered to taste, if desired. Just remember to add all ingredients and mix before adding in the tomatoes, as they are extremely delicate and do not withstand stirring very well once they are cut.\"",
    "ins": "Peel cucumber, alternating rows so that thin green strips of peel are left. Slice cucumber into thin rounds.\nStir cucumber, jicama, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a bowl until salad is evenly mixed. Gently fold tomatoes into salad.",
