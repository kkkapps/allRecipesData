    "ins": "In a large bowl pour the boiling water over the rolled oats. Add the scalded milk and stir. Pour in the oil and molasses. Stir well.\nIn a separate bowl mix the sugar with the yeast and 1 cup of the flour. When the oatmeal mixture has cooled to lukewarm add the yeast-flour mixture. Stir in the salt and remaining 5 cups of flour. Knead dough for 6 to 8 minutes. Place the dough in a covered greased bowl and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.\nPunch the dough down. Knead for 2 minutes. Divide dough into two pieces and place into greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pans. Cover pans and let rise until almost doubled in size.\nBake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour, or until nicely browned. Let the loaves cool on a rack. Remove loaves from pan; wrap well and store in a cool spot.",
