Cook and stir beef, sausage, and onion in the hot skillet until beef and sausage are completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease.\nStir stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, light red kidney beans, dark red kidney beans, mild salsa, chili seasoning mix, and garlic powder into the beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the flavors meld, 90 minutes to 2 hours.",
