    "des": "\"This is a scrumptious combination of a favorite Southern restaurant's green bean side dish and potato salad. It's fabulous and your family will thank you. You can serve it right away, but it does well for a few hours in the fridge. Eat cold or at room temperature.\"",

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 18 to 20 minutes. Add green beans to the boiling water; blanch for just 1 minute.

Cut potatoes into quarters.\nPlace the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.\nWhisk vinegar, olive oil, mayonnaise, and mustard together in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Add potatoes and green beans; stir to coat. Top with bacon, blue cheese, and green onions; stir once to incorporate.",
