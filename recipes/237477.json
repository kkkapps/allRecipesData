    "des": "\"For me, this is summer on a slice of bread. August is national goat cheese month (no, I don't know who decides these things), and what better way to enjoy chevre than by topping it with sweet, ripe, impossibly juicy peach slices? Mix in a little thyme and black pepper to keep things interesting, and you're looking at a very special treat.\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nPlace toast on prepared baking sheet and drizzle each side with about 1 teaspoon olive oil.\nStir goat cheese, thyme, pepper together in a bowl until soft and spreadable.\nSpread cheese mixture on each piece of toast all the way to the edges so entire piece is covered.\nTop each toast with 3 peach slices; drizzle remaining olive oil and sprinkle salt over the top.\nBroil in the preheated oven until tops and edges are lightly browned and cheese and peaches are warmed through, about 2 minutes.",
