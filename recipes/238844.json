    "des": "\"I've always considered myself something of a fried chicken expert. I've pretty much had every single style known to man and this Korean fried chicken is officially my favorite. No other method I've come across has the same combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and plate-scratching crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!\"",
    "ins": "Stir chicken, onion, garlic, fine salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).\nWhisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Gradually whisk ice water into flour in until mixture resembles a smooth pancake batter. Transfer chicken to batter and stir to coat chicken completely.\nWorking in batches, cook chicken in preheated oil for 4 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to a cooling rack.\nIncrease oil temperature in the deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nWorking in batches, cook chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.",
