    "des": "\"This is an old recipe, made by my grandmother who lived on an island in the North Atlantic, long before 'goulash' was made with ground beef. It was our typical meal when Mom was rushed to put something hot and tasty on the table. My family and friends use it lots, and I add the grated Parmesan on top to give it a gourmet touch. Nice with a green salad.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nHeat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until the onion is soft, about 5 minutes; stir in the green pepper, and cook until tender, about 8 more minutes. Mash the corned beef into the pot, and simmer until hot. Mix in the tomato soup, ketchup, cooked macaroni, salt and black pepper; stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top, and serve.",
