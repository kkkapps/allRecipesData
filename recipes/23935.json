    "des": "\"My best friend shared this recipe with me, and we are SO SICK of making it -- but it's always requested at our parties! We have made the pretzel in various shapes, depending on the occasion (e.g., hearts, sorority letters, etc.). The pretzel may be partially baked ahead of time and frozen. The dip may also be prepared in advance.\"",

Sprinkle with kosher salt.\nBake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.\nIn a food processor, blend the cream cheese, processed cheese, garlic powder and room temperature beer. Refrigerate until serving with the baked dough.",
