    "des": "\"This is a quick, light salad that is very satisfying. Great for one person or a large group. I used this for myself one night for dinner, but the recipe can be made for any number of people. I also didn't think to put pecans on the salad at the time, but I'm sure it would make a great addition to it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nSpread goat cheese inside each date half.\nCook dates on preheated grill until dates begin to caramelize and goat cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from grill and cut each date half into halves.\nMix spinach, pear, onion, and tomatoes together on a plate or in a bowl; top with dates. Drizzle olive oil and vinegar over salad.",
