    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter and milk. Cook until melted, stirring occasionally. Set aside to cool.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Stir in the milk mixture by hand until the dough is firm and not tacky. Mix in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Roll the dough into 1 1/2 inch balls and place onto the prepared cookie sheets. These cookies do not spread much, so you can place them fairly close together.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. Glaze with a thin confectioners' icing when cool to preserve freshness.",
