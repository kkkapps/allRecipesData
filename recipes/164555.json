    "des": "\"This is a really good soup that tastes just like tacos. In fact, if you omit the tomato juice it makes a good meat for tacos. It can also be prepared in a pot instead of a slow cooker. Serve with shredded cheese and chips if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir beef until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Transfer beef to a slow cooker and sprinkle with the taco seasoning mix and ranch dressing mix.\nAdd the diced tomatoes and green chiles, corn, and black beans, all with their liquid, to the slow cooker. Stir the black olives, onion, bell pepper, and tomato juice into the ground beef mixture. Cook on Low until the vegetables are completely tender, about 5 hours.",
