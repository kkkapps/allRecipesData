Add cubed chicken to skillet and brown lightly. Add garlic and ground red pepper. Reduce heat slightly and saute, covered, for 1 to 2 minutes, until garlic is golden brown.\nUsing a wooden spoon, add lemon juice, stirring to break up particles on bottom of skillet (deglazing). Add butter/margarine, stirring and blending well into the sauce. Return bell pepper and onion to skillet, stir all together and add parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.",
