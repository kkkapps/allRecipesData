    "des": "\"This is a Meat Sauce from Upstate New York that is used on top of Hot Dogs.  When I grew up it was used on steamed hot dogs and steamed rolls, sometimes with raw onions (for those who like them) on top!  Very good... thanks Grandma Slattery for getting the recipe!\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute the onion in butter until soft. Stir in the vinegar, brown sugar, lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Stir to blend.\nWhen the mixture begins to simmer, add the raw ground beef breaking it into pieces with a wooden spoon. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Serve over steamed hot dogs. Of course you can add some raw onions if you want.",
