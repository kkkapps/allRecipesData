    "des": "\"This is a wonderful-tasting authentic soup, not to mention it's very healthy for you. I lived in Peru for a couple of years, it's one of my all-time favorites! I know it has a lot of ingredients but it's worth eating! Substitute garbanzo beans with white beans if desired. Fresh corn, lima beans, and peas can be used instead of frozen. If you want more amounts of the vegetables, add some more. I usually eyeball the amount. Enjoy!\"",
