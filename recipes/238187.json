    "des": "\"This is the perfect breakfast for those days when you really want a muffin but need something hearty and healthy like oatmeal. For the best flavor use a very ripe banana. Any fruit can be substituted for the banana, including dried fruit (cranberries!) and nuts. The bars are great the next day, too. Once cool, put the bars into the fridge, then pop them in the microwave for a few seconds before eating.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.\nBeat applesauce and white sugar together in a bowl. Add oats, milk, eggs, baking powder, and salt to applesauce mixture; beat until evenly mixed. Stir banana into oat mixture. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.\nStir brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over banana batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until firm, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before slicing into bars.",
