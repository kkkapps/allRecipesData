    "des": "\"Mom won five dollars for this recipe in 1933 which bought us groceries. Everyone who partakes asks for recipe. We learned of their keeping value only when she sent them to troops in Korea. Before that none of the cookies had lasted long enough for us to know if they kept well! Store separated by wax paper. Substitute dates for the raisins if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\nPlace the raisins or chopped dates in a bowl and cover with white wine. Set aside to soak.\nCream the shortening with the brown and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and lemon and or vanilla extracts.\nStir the flour, cinnamon and salt together.\nDissolve the baking soda in 1/3 cup of the wine and beat it into the shortening mixture. Stir in the flour. Drain the soaked raisins and stir them and the walnuts into the dough.\nDrop tablespoonfuls of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 10 minutes.",
