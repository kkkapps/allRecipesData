    "ins": "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion in hot butter until soft and caramelized, 30 to 60 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir mushrooms until browned and tender yet crisp, about 10 minutes.

Cut out 5-inch circles using a round cutter and place on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and puffed, about 12 minutes. Transfer puffs to a wire rack to cool completely.\nBeat goat cheese and egg together in a bowl until smooth. Season with thyme. Spread goat cheese mixture over cooled pastry puffs; top each with caramelized onions and mushrooms. Place pastries back onto baking sheet.\nBake in the oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes.",
