    "des": "\"Delicata squash is one of the best winter squashes even though it is a fairly 'new' squash. The skin can be eaten and it is almost the best part of the squash. I was curious about the squash when I saw it at the farmer market and 'had to have it' and this is how I chose to make it. Kids and adults love it!\"",
