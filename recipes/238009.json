Cool cookies on a wire rack.\nMelt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.\nSpread apricot preserves on the top of half of the cooled cookies. Place a second cookie over the apricot layer creating a sandwich. Dip half of each sandwich cookie into the melted chocolate and place on a sheet of waxed paper to dry.",
