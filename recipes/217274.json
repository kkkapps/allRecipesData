Lightly grease a baking dish.\nRub both sides of each mackerel fillet with olive oil and place with the skin side down into the prepared baking dish. Season each fillet with the paprika, salt, and pepper. Top each fillet with two lemon slices.\nBake the fillets under the broiler until the fish just begins to flake, 5 to 7 minutes.
