    "des": "\"Tasty cookies made with walnuts and fondant.  The title suggests what cookies will look like when finished, little nests with eggs in them...cute! Got the recipe from my aunt, don't know where it originated before that!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in the egg yolks then stir in the vanilla.  Stir in the flour and mix well.\nIn a shallow dish, such as a pie pan, beat egg whites until foamy.  Spread walnuts on a plate or waxed paper.\nRoll 1 teaspoon of dough into a ball; roll in egg whites then in walnuts.  Place 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet.   Make a depression in each ball with your thumb.\nBake in preheated oven for 12 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cream the remaining 2 tablespoons butter with corn syrup, blue and green food coloring and almond extract.  Gradually stir in confectioners' sugar.  Roll 1/2 teaspoon of fondant mixture into egg-shaped balls.  Place fondant eggs into hollows of baked cookies.",
