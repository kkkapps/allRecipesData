    "des": "\"If you think green tea is boring and tasteless, then this is something that could COMPLETELY change your mind. The sparkling fizz makes it taste fresh and feel good on your throat, while the sugar, lime, and green tea add a zingy sensation to the old taste. This is a personal family favorite, and I made it up in my own kitchen! Perfect for parties, get-togethers, and family picnics on hot summer days.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the hot water into a glass pitcher. Submerge the green tea bags in the hot water and allow to steep for 5 minutes; remove and discard the tea bags. Stir the sugar into the tea until completely dissolved. Chill in refrigerator for 35 minutes.\nPour the seltzer water and lime juice into the tea. Float the lime slices atop the mixture.",
