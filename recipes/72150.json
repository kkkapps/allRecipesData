    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a blender or food processor, puree the cilantro, basil, and 3 cloves of garlic until minced very fine.  Thoroughly combine the herb mixture in a large bowl with the Parmesan, and 1/4 cup of olive oil; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Pack the mixture firmly, about 1 inch thick, into a medium-sized, glass baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until the top is lightly browned and crispy, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove from oven, stir well, and return to the oven for an additional 5 to 7 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from the oven, break apart with a spoon, and allow to cool.\nWhile the crunchy stuff is baking, heat olive oil in a large pan over low heat.  Lightly brown 2 tablespoons of garlic, stir in the mushrooms, and cook until softened.  Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, and Alfredo sauce; cook to warm.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  To serve, toss pasta in sauce, and sprinkle with crunchy stuff!",
