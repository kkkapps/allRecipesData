Blend the softened dried chile, fresh red chile pepper, garlic, onion, and ginger in a blender to a paste.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken in the hot oil until golden on all sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside. Remove excess oil from the skillet, leaving about 1 tablespoon.
