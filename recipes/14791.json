    "ins": "Place ground pork into a large skillet. Lightly brown, but don't completely cook. Shred the potatoes like hash browns. Add shredded potatoes to pork, mix together and add just enough water to cover the bottom of the skillet. Cover skillet and let simmer until potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon pork mixture into shells and garnish with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and any other toppings desired.",
