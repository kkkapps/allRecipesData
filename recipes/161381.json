    "des": "\"This is a great recipe if you don't want to fuss around in the kitchen.  I discovered it one night when I wanted something packed with flavor, but wasn't willing to slave away in the kitchen.  It's a meaty dish, with a hint of curry and cumin flavor.  Serve on it's own or on some basmati rice. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, cumin, and curry powder; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garbanzo beans, red bell pepper, turnip, corn, and tomato sauce. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender and the curry has thickened, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
