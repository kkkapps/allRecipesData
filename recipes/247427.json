    "des": "\"I often eat these for lunch or breakfast on my current diet. They have a great flavor while remaining healthy, and are very easy to make! \n\nIs it as good as a buttermilk crust quiche? No. But it sure takes care of the hunger pangs!\n\n I personally dip mine in sriracha sauce but I have had friends who sprinkle some Tabasco\u00c2\u00ae on theirs.\"",
