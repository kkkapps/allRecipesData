    "des": "\"This is my slightly healthier and much spicier version of this yummy comfort food. I threw it together with the veggies I had on hand and it turned out delicious, so fiance asked me to save it in our rotation. We like everything pretty insanely spicy, so if you don't, just omit the habanero and serrano peppers.\"",
