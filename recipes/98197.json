    "des": "\"My daughter and I love the black beans found at a popular fast food chicken restaurant, but I could not find a recipe for that particular taste. I think I came pretty close with this one. A little spicy, a little sweet but oh, so good!!! These beans go great with almost any meat but are especially good with grilled chicken.\"",
    "ins": "Drain the black beans from their soaking water and place in a slow cooker. Fill with enough fresh water to cover them. Cover and set to High.\nHeat bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until tender. Stir this into the beans along with the brown sugar, liquid smoke, molasses and jalapeno slices. Stir to blend, then cover and cook on High for 5 to 6 hours, or until beans are tender.",
