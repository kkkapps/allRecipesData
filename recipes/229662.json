    "des": "\"My cranky old 1934 oven is very small and slow, so I devised this method of cooking holiday meals. The slow cooker keeps the turkey breast moist, and cooking the dressing in the same cooker gives it a wonderful flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions and celery in the hot butter until onions are translucent, about 8 minutes; remove from heat.\nPlace a plastic slow cooker liner into a 6-quart slow cooker. Place dry bread stuffing into the liner bag and sprinkle contents of seasoning packet over the bread. Stir cooked onions and celery, cranberry sauce, 1/2 cup melted butter, chicken broth, and 1/2 teaspoon salt into the dressing mix, taking care not to pierce the bag.\nRinse turkey breast and pat dry with paper towels; season turkey breast with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Push the dressing mixture to the edge of the cooker and lay the turkey breast into the slow cooker with the pop-up timer facing upward.\nCook on High until the pop-up timer in the turkey breast pops, 4 to 4 1/2 hours. Transfer turkey breast to a cutting board and let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Transfer dressing to a serving bowl and serve alongside turkey.",
