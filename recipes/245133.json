    "des": "\"An amazing refreshing fish that is low in mercury, available at your local Asian market, or able to be caught yourself if your in the Southeast coastal United States. Some of the tastiest fish I've had...and it has big bones which is nice if you're the type that hates having to pick those little bones out of your mouth.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Place dish in the grill, away from direct heat.\nDrop coconut oil onto the foil and close grill long enough to melt oil. Place fish in the oil and turn until it is coated in oil on both sides; season with salt and pepper. Close grill.\nCook on the grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Carefully transfer fish and foil onto a plate and slide fish off the foil. Squeeze lime juice over fish.",
