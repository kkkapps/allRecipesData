Transfer dough to a baking sheet. Spread 1 tablespoon of preserves on top.\nPeel, halve, core, and thinly slice apples. Arrange on dough in an overlapping circle from outer edge to center.\nBake in the preheated oven until tart is golden brown with slightly darker edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Place on a cooling rack.\nCombine remaining 1 tablespoon preserves and 1 teaspoon water in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat in a microwave until melted, about 10 seconds; brush over tart.",
