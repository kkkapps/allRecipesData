    "des": "\"It's almost the end of the season for us at the lake, and with us moving to Florida, I really want to clean out the refrigerator. I will be using up what I have over the next few weeks, and this morning I found 2 bags of frozen blueberries. I normally use them for my smoothies, and this morning I wanted pancakes. I love pancakes but don't always want to stand over the stove flipping them. \n\nThis morning, I decided to make one in my cast iron skillet and OMG I was in paleo heaven! I did drizzle local maple syrup, and now I am a happy person ready to start my day. \n\nAnother one-pot recipe perfected. Enjoy with your favorite toppings and more fruit!\"",
