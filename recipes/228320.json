Peel tomatoes, starting from the 'X' side; chop.\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chile pepper and tomatoes; cook and stir until tomatoes begin reduce, 5 to 8 minutes. Pour in wine; cook over medium heat until wine reduces slightly, about 5 more minutes. Stir in salt, black pepper, basil, and parsley.\nPlace cod loins into tomato mixture; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Turn cod and cook other side until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes. Add prawns; cover and cook until prawns are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.",
