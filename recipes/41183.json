    "des": "\"A Tex-Mex variation on this Southern-American favorite. This version uses sour tomatillos instead of green tomatoes for a tangy bite! This dish is perfect served as a breakfast side dish, with red meat, or as part of a Mexican meal.\"",
    "ins": "Place egg whites in a shallow bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, mix together cornmeal, herbs, salt and pepper.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip tomatillo slices in egg whites, then dredge in cornmeal mixture turning to coat both sides.\nFry tomatillo slices 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Be careful not to over cook; tomatillos should be tender, but not totally softened. Serve immediately.",
