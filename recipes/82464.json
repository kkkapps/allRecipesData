    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nMeanwhile, heat the corn oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir in the beef and cook until well browned, stirring frequently to break apart, about 7 minutes.  Add the pine nuts, and cook for another minute until dark brown.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, then remove from the heat, and drain off excess fat.\nIn a large bowl, crush the garlic into a smooth paste.  Whisk the yogurt with the garlic until creamy and smooth.  Once the pasta has been cooked and drained, place into a serving dish, and pour the yogurt over it. Top with the cooked meat and nuts while it is still hot.",
