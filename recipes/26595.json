Quickly sear the meat about 5 seconds on each side, then remove from skillet. Melt and brown the butter in the skillet. Return the meat to the skillet, and fry 4 to 5 minutes on each side. The outside of the meat should be browned and crisp. Remove from the skillet and let stand for about 5 minutes for the juices to settle.",
