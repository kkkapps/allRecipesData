    "des": "\"A dish of either German or possibly Polish origin, made special by my mother, grandmother, her mother before her, etc.  The men will love this one, too, and the beer broth is nothing short of amazing.  I like to use whatever is in the fridge. Ales, lagers, and wheat brews work best.  Did I mention this is an incredibly easy, one-pot dish that kids love? Hope you like it!\"",
    "ins": "Pour the beer into a large pot, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Layer the potatoes into the bottom of the pot, and sprinkle a little Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper over the potatoes. Layer the baby carrots, onion, smoked sausage, and cabbage, sprinkling every layer with a bit more of the Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. Turn heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.",
