    "ins": "Peel cucumbers, but leave a little on for color and slice by hand as thin as possible. Dry slices with paper towels.\nPlace dried cucumber slices in a large bowl with onion slices. Generously season with salt and pepper. Toss well and let sit 10 minuets, drain any excess liquids.\nToss cucumbers and onions in with enough sour cream to coat. Refrigerate until well chilled. Stir, and season with salt and pepper to taste if needed.",
