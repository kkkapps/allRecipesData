    "des": "\"This fudge takes constant vigilance, but it is worth the effort. A rich, creamy, traditional recipe, without marshmallow cream or brown sugar. To make other flavors, replace peanut butter with white chocolate chips and any flavor extract of your choice.\"",
    "ins": "Spray a 9x9-inch pan with cooking spray.\nMix evaporated milk and sugar together in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly, until syrup reaches 234 degrees F (110 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes. A teaspoon of hot syrup dropped into a glass of cold water should form a soft ball of candy.\nRemove from heat and immediately stir in peanut butter, butter, and vanilla extract. Stir constantly until fudge is smooth and thick. Pour fudge into prepared pan. Let cool before slicing into squares.",
