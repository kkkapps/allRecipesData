    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare instant rice according to package directions. (Note: 2 cups of uncooked rice will yield about 4 cups of cooked rice.)\nIn a 9x13 inch baking dish, thoroughly mix the cooked rice, soup, water, lemon pepper, lemon and herb seasoning, cumin and thyme. Press chicken breasts into mixture until only the tops show.\nCover and cook 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Pierce chicken breasts with a fork. Continue cooking 30 minutes. Enjoy!",
