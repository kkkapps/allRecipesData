    "des": "\"This is an authentic German cheesecake recipe from my friend Isolde, a dear friend and coworker, gave to me many years ago. Quark is found in Germany and parts of Europe. If you cannot find quark you may substitute fromage frais, yogurt cheese, mascarpone, 2 parts ricotta plus 1 part sour cream, or strained cottage cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch springform pan.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the butter and sugar until smooth. Mix in 1 egg, then stir in the baking powder and flour.  Knead together into dough. Press into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan.\nMix together the quark, oil, 3/4 cup white sugar, vanilla sugar, and pudding mix in a large bowl until smooth. Blend in the egg yolks, egg, milk, and lemon juice; pour mixture into the prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven until the filling no longer moves when you shake the pan, about 1 hour.",
