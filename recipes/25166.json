    "ins": "In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium low heat.  Add the onion and saute until transparent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the green peas and the broth, and cook for about 3 minutes.  Add the snap peas, snow peas and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cook, covered, for about 3 more minutes.\nRemove the inner leaves from the radicchio and spread the outer leaves out to make a bowl.  Fill the hollow with the pea mixture and garnish with additional Italian parsley.",
