    "des": "\"This is a refreshing salad using all different kinds of vegetables. You can use whatever you like, but the main things that makes it good are the tomatoes and cucumbers. It is much like an Israeli salad. The homemade dressing is very good on it, but so is just plain olive oil.\"",
    "ins": "Toss together the cucumber, tomato, onion, pepper, radish, jicama, and lettuce in a large salad bowl. Whisk together the garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, pomegranate juice, salt, pepper, dill, basil, and water in a small bowl. Drizzle dressing over the salad just before serving.",
