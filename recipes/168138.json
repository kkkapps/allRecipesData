    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat.  Season the lamb with salt and pepper, add to the pot, and cook until deeply browned, about 5 minutes on each side.  Stir in the onions and garlic, and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.\nPour the wine into the pot, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, lamb stock, lemon zest and juice, oregano, cinnamon, and bay leaf.  Bring back to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lamb is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  Stir in the green beans and cook until they are tender, about 20 additional minutes.\nRemove the bay leaf and any bones from the stew.  Garnish stew with chopped fresh parsley.",
