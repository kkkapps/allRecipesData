    "des": "\"With all the fancy grilled summer meats flying around, it's easy to forget about the side dishes. Nobody wants to spend hours in the kitchen when they could be outside playing volleyball in jhorts. With this easy bok choy rice, you can have something much more interesting in the same time as it takes to make plain rice.\"",
    "ins": "Separate bok choy leaves from stems. Slice stems into 1-inch pieces; chop leaves.\nCombine water, rice, and soy sauce in a pot; bring to a simmer and stir in bok choy stems. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and cook until rice is almost cooked through, about 18 minutes.\nStir bok choy leaves, chili-garlic sauce, and sesame oil into rice mixture with a fork. Remove pot from heat, cover the pot with a lid, and let sit until rice is cooked through and bok choy leaves wilt, about 5 minutes more. Fluff with a fork and garnish with sesame seeds.",
