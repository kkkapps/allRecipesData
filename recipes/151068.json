    "des": "\"I wanted to find a way to make beef brisket that wasn't a BBQ recipe but wasn't just plain beef either. This is what I came up with and my family LOVED it.\"",
    "ins": "Season the beef brisket with salt and pepper and place into a shallow baking dish or large resealable bag. Combine the Merlot and balsamic vinegar; pour in with the steak. Seal or cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nArrange onion rings in the bottom of a roasting pan. Season with garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Pour the marinade into the bottom of the pan along with the beef stock and stewed tomatoes, and lay the roast on top of the onions so they form a roasting rack. Cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.\nBake for 3 hours in the preheated oven, then peel back the aluminum foil and add carrots and celery to the pan. Cover again and continue roasting for an addition 1 to 2 hours, or until the brisket can be pulled apart with a fork.",
