    "des": "\"This recipe has been passed around the family for years. A pretty cranberry sauce replaces plain brown sugar as a topping for acorn squash. The squash may be cooked more quickly in the microwave by cooking it on high 5 minutes, cutting it in half, removing the seeds and cooking another 5 minutes, or until tender.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nOn a medium baking sheet, place the squash halves cut side up. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until tender.\nIn a medium saucepan, mix the brown sugar, white sugar and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.\nMix the cranberries and port into the saucepan. Cook until the cranberriess begin to burst, about 5 minutes. Spoon the cranberries into the squash halves and serve.",
