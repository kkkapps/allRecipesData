    "des": "\"This recipe has many vegetables and three kinds of meat. Most people can't tell it's not all beef and I've been told I ought to market it. This sauce has no acidic after taste, which is frequent with sauces that have tomato and/or bell pepper cooked over long periods of time. This sauce freezes well and can be used for other recipes.\"",
