    "des": "\"This is a relaxed slow cooker recipe. I've never really measured ingredients out as I've gone, but the end result is absolutely amazing. I never even use BBQ sauce, but you can if you want. Feel free to play with the ingredients, more or less here and there, to suit the tastes of your family. And get ready for a whole lot of mmmmmmm.\"",

Place roast in the slow cooker, fat-side up. Brush any leftover seasonings mixture from the work surface into the slow cooker.\nCook on Low for 1 hour. Pour ginger beer into slow cooker. Continue cooking until roast is tender and pulls apart easily with a fork, 9 to 11 hours.",
