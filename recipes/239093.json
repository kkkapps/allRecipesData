    "des": "\"This is my grandmother's recipe for homemade lemon mint ice tea. A sip of this tea brings back wonderful memories of summer days at my grandparents' house for my brother and I. As we got older, we tweaked the recipe to include lemon vodka, which we now call 'Koehler's Killer Tea.' Enjoy!\"",
