    "des": "\"This is my favorite recipe for pancakes. Over time I tweaked a recipe I found, till i got it just right! It makes fluffy pancakes with that little bit of extra from the vanilla and cinnamon! These pancakes are especially good with your favorite berry syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Whisk in the milk, egg, 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until only a few lumps remain. Let the batter stand for 5 full minutes for extra fluffiness.\nHeat a skillet or griddle over medium heat, and brush with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. When the oil shimmers, slowly pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the hot pan. Cook until bottom is browned, about 2 minutes, then flip and cook until the center of the pancake is set and the other side is browned, about 2 more minutes. Keep warm until serving.",
