    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cupcake pans with paper cupcake liners.\nIn a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and 1 cup of sugar. Stir in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the vanilla. Spoon into cupcake pans to fill about 2/3 to 3/4 full.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool for 5 to 10 minutes.\nTo make the sour cream topping, whisk together the sour cream, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Spoon into the well on the top of each cupcake.\nReturn to the oven and bake for an additional 5 to 7 minutes, until set. Set cupcake pans on racks to cool, do not remove cupcakes from the pan until they are completely cool. For a finishing touch, you can add a dollop of your favorite pie filling on top.",
