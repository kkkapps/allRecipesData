Cover and chill in refrigerator.\nMash avocados, remaining onions, remaining serrano chile pepper, and remaining lime juice together in a bowl to make guacamole. Season with salt and pepper.\nHeat a skillet over medium-high heat; pan-fry burger patties to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nAssemble each sandwich by placing a burger in each bun; top burger with guacamole, shredded lettuce, and pico de gallo.",
