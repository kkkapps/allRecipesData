    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPut the butter and garlic into a large skillet, and place over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the garlic begins to sizzle, stir in the shrimp, red pepper flakes, and oregano. Cook until the shrimp are firm and opaque, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, then stir in the chopped parsley, and pour into a casserole dish.\nPour vermouth into the skillet, and simmer until reduced by half. Add chopped tomatoes and continue cooking until heated through. Spoon tomato mixture on top of the shrimp and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese softens and turns golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.",
