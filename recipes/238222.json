    "des": "\"I had only one package of spinach and didn't have onion so I added a bit more garlic and onion powder, forgot the flour, and used just one tablespoon butter. This was easy, quick (defrosted spinach in microwave), and done when the steaks came off the grill. Perfect quick and fancy side dish for a steakhouse dinner at diner prices. I would definitely serve this again and add the onion and cheese or breadcrumbs. Tomorrow, soup for one.\"",
