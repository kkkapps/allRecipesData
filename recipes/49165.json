    "des": "\"This is a great recipe for those who love spicy food. If not, simply omit the crushed red pepper. This recipe will have your family eating the leftovers out of the refrigerator. A piece of advice: use the best vodka you can - it really makes a big difference! Serve with pasta, and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese.\"",
