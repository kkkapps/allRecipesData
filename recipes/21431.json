Boil 10 minutes, or until the onion is soft. Stir into the prepared stuffing.\nRinse turkey, and pat dry. Loosely fill the body and neck cavities with the stuffing mixture.\nPlace turkey in a large roasting pan and cook 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature of the thigh meat is 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) and the stuffing is at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).",
