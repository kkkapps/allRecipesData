Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the wet ingredients, being careful not to over mix the batter.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes per side.
