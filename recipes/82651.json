    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and green peppers; cook and stir until soft, about 10 minutes. Pour in the tomatoes, and season with salt, pepper and paprika. Cook and stir for another 10 minutes.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with a fork until well blended. Push all of the vegetables to one side of the pan. Pour the eggs into the empty half of the pan. Allow them to cook about halfway, then stir everything together, and cook for another 5 minutes. Serve over slices of rye bread.",
