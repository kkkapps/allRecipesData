    "ins": "Combine beef broth, water, potato, garlic, onion, and red chile pepper in a dutch oven or large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the kale, and season with nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes, until potato is tender, adding more water if necessary.\nMeanwhile, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until slightly browned, but still tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Chop bacon, and stir into the soup until just incorporated. Simmer no more than 3 minutes. Serve chilled for at least 2 hours, topped with crushed sage leaves. Soup can also be served hot.",
