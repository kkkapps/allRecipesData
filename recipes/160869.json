    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.\nBeat the egg in a bowl until smooth. Add the ground beef, cayenne pepper, crushed cereal, onion, salt, black pepper, and parsley. Mix until evenly combined; set aside. Stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a separate bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender until no lumps of shortening remain and the mixture takes on a sandy appearance. Stir in the milk until a dough forms.\nRoll the dough out to a 10x15-inch rectangle on a well-floured surface. Spread the meat mixture evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Roll the dough into a cylinder from one of the wide ends to form a 15-inch long log. Cut the log into 3/4-inch slices and place on to the prepared baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until dark golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Serve hot.",
