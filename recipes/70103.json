    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix the honey teriyaki sauce and wine. Place chicken in the bowl, and coat with the marinade. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour (it is best if you can marinate overnight).\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nDiscard marinade, and arrange chicken breasts in a baking dish. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until almost done.\nPlace the asparagus in a pot fitted with a steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water, and steam 5 minutes, until tender.\nPlace 4 asparagus spears on each chicken breast, and top each breast with a slice of Swiss cheese. Return to oven, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and chicken juices run clear.",
