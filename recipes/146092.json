    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSeason the halibut with garlic powder, salt, and pepper; cook in microwave until slightly cooked, about 2 minutes. Mix together the green onion, bell pepper, cilantro, sour cream, mayonnaise and 1 cup Cheddar cheese in a bowl. Gently fold the halibut into the mixture.\nPrepare a 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray. Pour 1/2 of a can of enchilada sauce into the bottom of the baking dish.\nPour 1 can of enchilada sauce into a bowl. Dip the tortillas, one at a time, into the sauce to lightly coat. Spoon the halibut in equal portions into the center of each tortilla. Make the enchiladas by tightly rolling the tortillas and place seam-side down in the baking dish. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over top of the enchiladas. Sprinkle with 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil\nBake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Top with avocado slices to serve.",
