    "des": "\"A wonderful use for fall squash.  If there is too much filling, surplus may be baked in custard cups set in pan of hot water.  Do not bake together with the pie, because the steam from the water will make the pie soggy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a small saucepan, cover squash cubes with water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash. Measure out 2 cups of mashed squash and refrigerate remaining leftover amount.\nMix sugar, salt, and spices.  Blend in milk, squash, eggs, and butter or margarine.  Pour filling into unbaked pie shell.\nBake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until a knife blade inserted in the center comes out clean.",
