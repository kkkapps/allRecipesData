    "des": "\"This is the quickest and easiest way to make Sauerbraten that was handed down by my grandmother. Our family has always used a pressure cooker. However, a Dutch oven or large pot may be substituted but this would increase the cooking time.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the shortening in a pressure cooker pot over medium-high heat. Add the stew beef; cook, turning occasionally, until the outside is browned. Pour in the water, vinegar and browning sauce. Add the bay leaves and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nClose the lid on the pressure cooker and bring to full pressure. Adjust the heat as needed. Once the pot comes to full pressure, cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and release the pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions. While the pressure is releasing, mix together the flour and 1/2 cup of water in a cup. Pour this into the pressure cooker, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until thickened.",
