    "des": "\"Bite-sized cuts of filet mignon are stuffed with jalapeno-spiked cream cheese, wrapped in bacon, and grilled. This dish is very popular with our tailgating crowd at football games. Its very easy to prepare and only takes a few minutes to grill.\"",
    "ins": "Slice the steaks into 1/2-inch wide strips. Pound the strips to about half their original thickness. Place the steak in a bowl; pour the Italian dressing over the meat; allow to marinate at least 2 hours.\nMix together the cream cheese and jalapeno pepper in a bowl; set aside. Remove the strips from the marinade and lay out on a flat surface. Spread about 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture on each strip.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.\nRemove the strips from the marinade and lay on a flat surface. Spread about 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture on each strip. Fold the meat around the cream cheese mixture to form a ball. Wrap each ball with a slice of bacon. Secure bacon with water-soaked toothpicks or metal skewers.\nCook on preheated grill until steak is no longer pink, about 4 minutes per side.",
