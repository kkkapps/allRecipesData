    "des": "\"My grandmother gave me this recipe. It is a very good dessert made up of graham crackers, orange gelatin, pineapple and whipped topping.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the gelatin mix into a large bowl, and stir in the boiling water until the gelatin has dissolved. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.\nMake a layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a glass 9x13 inch baking dish. Spoon a layer of gelatin over the graham crackers, and top with a layer of crushed pineapple. Cover with a layer of whipped topping. Repeat the layers all the way to the top of the pan, ending with whipped topping on top. Refrigerate for a few hours before serving to let the graham crackers absorb the flavors of orange and pineapple.",
