    "des": "\"In Barbados okras are plentiful!  My family eats them almost weekly and this is our favorite way of cooking them!  One of the greatest things about this dish is that the okras are not slimy or mushy, and the lime gives it a great kick!  I often serve this dish with a curry... but it is a great side dish for most meals!!!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the okra, salt, and pepper. Increase the heat to high; cook and stir until the okra begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Pour the lime juice over the okra and continue cooking for 2 minutes.",
