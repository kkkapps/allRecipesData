    "des": "\"Two old college roommates love bacon. And they love gorgonzola. And biscuit dough. We spent many an all-nighter nourished only by monkey bread. Can you see where we're going?  \n\nThis pull-apart bread is a savory version of the classic monkey bread. And it's awesome. Mmmm... bacon.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.\nSeparate each biscuit into 4 pieces; roll into balls.\nCombine bacon and onion in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir with wooden spoon until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in biscuit balls, Gorgonzola cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Pour into the prepared tube pan and spread evenly.\nBake in the preheated oven until top is golden and biscuits are cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan; invert onto a serving plate.",
