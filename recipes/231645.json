    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust each into the bottom of two 9-inch pie pans.\nMix ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and eggs together in a large bowl. Roughly chop the pepperoni, sweet capicola and hot capicola; fold in chopped meats. Spoon half the mixture into each of the 2 prepared pie pans.\nTop each pie with a pie crust, crimping the edges together creating a seal. Brush the top of each pie with egg white.\nBake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.",
