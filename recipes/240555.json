    "des": "\"This spicy cranberry sauce uses honey and pears to sweeten it instead of sugar. I try to prepare this at least a few hours ahead of time to allow all the flavors to blend, but if you don't have time to wait, it's still delicious. A beautiful sweet/tart addition to any feast.\"",
    "ins": "Combine honey, apple cider, water, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium and simmer, stirring frequently, until smooth, about 5 minutes. Add pears and cranberries and return to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled and flavors have blended, at least 2 hours.",
