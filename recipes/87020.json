Set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the crabmeat, chili sauce, horseradish, hot pepper sauce and capers. Mix in enough of the cream cheese to form a sticky paste.\nStuff the openings of each shrimp with about 1 tablespoon of the crab salad. Sprinkle paprika over the top. Chill for about 30 minutes before serving.",
