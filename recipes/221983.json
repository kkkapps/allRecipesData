After shaping them, you can put cheese or anything you want into the middle for a filling. I personally like cream cheese or Cheddar cheese in mine but you can put whatever you want in the middle.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix ham, egg, mayonnaise, and half the breadcrumbs together in a bowl; shape into 6 meatballs. Spread the remaining breadcrumbs onto a plate; roll the balls in the breadcrumbs to coat. Arrange the balls in a baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.",
