    "ins": "Mix corn syrup, vegetable shortening, and salt in a large bowl. Beat in clear vanilla extract and cornstarch. Slowly stir in confectioners' sugar, about 1 cup at a time, mixing in the sugar thoroughly each time before adding the next cup. Fondant will become increasingly stiff; if too sticky, add more cornstarch and confectioners' sugar to make an easily-workable dough.\nTurn fondant onto a work surface generously dusted with cornstarch; roll to desired thickness.",
