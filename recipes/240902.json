    "des": "\"This is a healthy alternative for the typical saturated fatty refried beans. Don't let the time scare you off. I soak them while I sleep and cook them during the day, so by dinner it is only 10 minutes from stove top to table. Not much longer than preparing a processed can product.\"",
    "ins": "Place beans in a slow cooker and cover with 8 cups water; soak for 8 to 10 hours.\nDrain and rinse beans and return to slow cooker; top with 8 cups fresh water.\nCook beans on Low for 8 to 10 hours. Drain.\nCombine 1/2 cup water, beans, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a skillet over medium heat; mash beans to desired consistency.",
