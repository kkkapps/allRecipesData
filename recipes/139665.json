    "des": "\"This amazingly fast and delicious soup is a family recipe given to me by my friend from Montreal. If you like a thicker soup, mash some of the potatoes when you add them to the stock. If you're not fond of hot, spicy food, use a milder sausage and omit the Frank's. Bon appetit!\"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.\nMeanwhile, heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage. Break up the sausage with a spatula, and cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Remove the sausage to drain on a paper towel-lined plate.\nStir the onion into the sausage drippings; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the kale, and cook and stir for 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock; stir in the sausage and potatoes, and return to a simmer. Stir in the hot sauce just before serving.",
