    "des": "\"A Salvadoran treat. The outer layer is made from sweet plantains and the inner filling is a delicious cinnamon cream. Serve sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.\"",
    "ins": "Boil plantains in a large pot of water until tender, 20 to 30 minutes; drain.\nPeel plantains while still hot and mash in a bowl until smooth.\nPour mashed plantains into a saucepan; add 1/2 cup sugar, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Refrigerate until cooled, about 20 minutes.\nWhisk 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch together in a small bowl until smooth.\nCombine 2 cups milk, 2 tablespoon sugar, lemon zest, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Add cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until filling thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPinch off a piece of the plantain mixture and roll into a ball the size of a golf ball. Flatten into a disc and place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center; fold in half and press edges to seal into an empanada. Repeat with remaining plantain mixture and filling.\nHeat oil in a deep skillet. Fry empanadas in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.",
