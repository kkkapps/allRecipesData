    "des": "\"In an attempt to eat healthier, my husband and I have been eating more vegetables and less meats. As a result, I have become more creative coming up with dinner meals. This casserole was delicious, used fresh vegetables I had on hand, and went together very quickly. I topped the casserole with French fried onions. Another option would be more grated cheese or crushed potato chips.\"",

Drain.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nCombine green beans, squash, peas, and carrots in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl; cook until tender, 3 to 10 minutes. Rinse vegetables with cold water and drain.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute mushrooms in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.\nWhisk mushroom soup and milk together in a large bowl; add vegetables, mushrooms, tuna, onion, and Cheddar cheese.
