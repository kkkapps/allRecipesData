    "des": "\"I absolutely love roasted cauliflower, so I came up with this soup one cold day. You don't even need to add cream to this soup to be completely satisfied with the thick creamy texture the cauliflower adds. Roasting the cauliflower and garlic brings the flavor of it to a whole other level. Double the recipe to assure leftovers, as it tastes almost better the next day for lunch! I serve this soup for lunch or dinner with a good cheesy bread.\n Enjoy!\"",
