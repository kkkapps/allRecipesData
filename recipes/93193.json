    "des": "\"This has been a family favorite for years. The key to this recipe is not overcooking the carrots and allowing the entire salad to marinate for at least 12 hours. For a spectacular presentation when serving, garnish the top with rings of each color of bell pepper and rings of onion.  Serve alone or over a bed of lettuce.\"",
    "ins": "Place the carrots in a large pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until carrots are tender. Do not over cook, the carrots should be firm but easy to bite into. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking.\nIn the container of a food processor or blender, combine the tomato soup, sugar, oil, vinegar, cayenne pepper, salt and mustard powder. Blend for about 3 minutes or until creamy.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the carrots, green, red and yellow bell peppers and onion. Toss with the dressing, cover and refrigerate overnight. The longer this salad is allowed to sit, the better it is.",
