    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nPlace chicken in a large saucepan with enough water to cover by at least 2 inches. Mix in the seasoning packets from the ramen noodles. Bring to a boil, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center. Remove chicken and set aside to cool. Add the ramen noodles to the boiling chicken water. Cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain. Chop chicken into bite sized pieces when it is cool enough to handle.\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the cream of mushroom soup, sour cream and milk. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish, and begin layering the ingredients as follows. 1/3 of the tortilla chips, 1/2 of the noodles, 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the broccoli, 1/3 of the cheese, and 1/2 of the soup mixture. Repeat layers a second time, then top with remaining tortilla chips and cheese.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through and bubbly.",
