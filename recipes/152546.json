    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir the flour and salt together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 1/4 cup of water until a dough forms. Divide the dough into thirds, roll 1/2 inch thick, and cut into strips 1 inch wide; set aside.\nBring the vinegar, 2 cups water, sugar, and vanilla extract to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Drop 2/3 of the dough strips into the boiling liquid. Once the liquid returns to a boil, pour into a 8x8 inch baking dish. Use the remaining dough strips to form a crisscross pattern on top of the cobbler. Dot the top with the softened butter.\nBake in the preheated oven until the dough strips are golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.",
