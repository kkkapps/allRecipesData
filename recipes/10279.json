    "des": "\"These cookies have 3 layers: one pistachio, one cherry, one chocolate. Fancy enough for gift-giving or impressing a crowd.\"",
    "ins": "Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with electric mixer until blended. Beat in egg and vanilla. On low speed, beat in flour until blended. Shape dough into a brick and cut in thirds.\nMelt 2 1/2 tablespoons of the mini-chips. Flatten 1 portion dough, scrape melted chocolate over top and carefully knead until blended. Knead in remaining mini-chips. With palms, roll into a 2-foot rope. Flatten to 1/2 inch.\nFlatten another portion dough. Add 2 drops green food color and knead to blend, sprinkling lightly with flour if necessary. Knead in chopped pistachios. Roll into 2-foot rope, flatten, cut in half (for easier handling) and place end to end on chocolate layer. Repeat with remaining dough, kneading in 1 drop red food coloring, then the cherries. Roll, flatten, cut and place on pistacio layer. Cut into two 1-foot blocks; square off sides as much as possible. Wrap and chill until firm.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCut blocks of chilled dough crosswise in 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.   Bake 8 minutes or until puffed. Remove to wire rack to cool.",
