    "des": "\"This famous grilled chicken recipe was created by Dr. Robert C. Baker at New York's Cornell University. They say Dr. Baker was simply trying to invent an easy and delicious way to grill smaller, younger chickens, so that the local chicken farms could sell more birds. The doc's tasty recipe ended up being such a success that sales in the area soared, and the recipe became a statewide favorite.\"",
    "ins": "Place the cider vinegar, oil, egg, salt, poultry seasoning, and black pepper in a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth.\nPour blended mixture into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken halves, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (up to overnight).\nRemove chicken halves from bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken dry with more paper towels. Reserve marinade mixture.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nGrill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 2 minutes. Turn each piece, brush with marinade mixture, and move to indirect heat.\nGrill, brushing with glaze and turning often, until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).",
