    "des": "\"I always have tons of Halloween candy from my kids and this is a great way to use up Kit Kats\u00c2\u00ae. I served this at Thanksgiving for those who didn't want pie. Everybody loved this cake. Frosting will be like a syrup but will thicken as it cools.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the inside of a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.\nCombine 4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 2 cups softened butter, milk, eggs, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract to flour mixture; lightly stir with a spatula to moisten ingredients. Mix on low speed until batter is evenly combined, about 3 minutes.\nToss candy bar pieces with remaining 1 tablespoon flour in a bowl until coated; fold into batter. Spread batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out moist with crumbs clinging, about 1 hour. Cool in pan for 25 minutes; remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.\nCombine 1/4 cup white sugar, evaporated milk, 1/4 cup butter, chocolate chips, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer until frosting is thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour frosting over cake.",
