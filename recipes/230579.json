    "des": "\"This yummy family tradition started when buying the kids their pumpkins. Each of the kids got one to make their jack o'lanterns. Mama got one to cook! Friends and family usually enjoy this treat. Tweak it to fit your family as I do mine! Enjoy with confectioners' sugar on top or cream cheese frosting!\"",
