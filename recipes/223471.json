    "des": "\"I like to cook this asparagus side dish on an indoor iron grill to get grill marks, but feel free to cook the asparagus any way you like. The key to this dish is the simple soy sauce and sesame oil marinade. This recipe comes from my sister Kaitlin. Sometimes I add a pinch of salt or pepper but don't tell her :)\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nGrill asparagus on preheated grill until they turn bright green and have grill marks, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to baking dish.\nWhisk soy sauce and sesame oil together in a bowl; pour over cooked asparagus. Marinate in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.",
