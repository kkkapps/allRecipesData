    "des": "\"Greek salad dressing has a little too much bite for me, so I added some of the ingredients used in French vinaigrette. This is still fresh and tangy, and a nice dressing for summer salads.\"",
    "ins": "Stir Greek seasoning and water together in a small bowl; let stand until seasoning is moistened, about 5 minutes.\nCrush the garlic clove with the side of a knife; sprinkle kosher salt over garlic and mash garlic and salt together into a paste with the edge of the knife.\nWhisk garlic mixture, olive oil, wine vinegar, lemon juice, lemon zest, Dijon mustard, pepper, and sugar into Greek seasoning mixture until combined.",
