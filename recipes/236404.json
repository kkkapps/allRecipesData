    "des": "\"We were supposed to go a local pub that serves their homemade house chips loaded with the works - melted cheese, sour cream, bacon, etc. Everything you should only have once in a great while. As things worked out we weren't able to go out. Since I was still craving that sinful appetizer and my homemade chips aren't always scrumptious, it dawned on me why not use store-bought kettle-cooked chips and top them! This was the perfect way to indulge in my loaded chip craving.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread chips into a baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until chips are warm, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over chips and bake in the oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Top chips with tomatoes, green onion, bacon, and sour cream.",
