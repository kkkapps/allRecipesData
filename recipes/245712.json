    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat; add bacon. Cook and stir until bacon turns golden, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat; add onions, butter, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions soften, about 20 minutes.\nPour bourbon into skillet. Simmer, uncovered, until most of the liquid evaporates but bacon and onion mixture is still moist, about 15 minutes.",
