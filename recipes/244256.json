    "des": "\"A new twist on old favorites, spaghetti sandwiches take spaghetti and places it between two pieces of toasted garlic bread buns to get you a new food sensation.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.\nHeat spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in ground beef and cook until sauce reaches a low simmer, about 5 minutes.\nPlace garlic bread on a baking sheet and cook in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes.\nSpread spaghetti sauce onto the plain side of each piece of garlic bread; top with tomatoes and oregano. Mix remaining sauce with spaghetti and scoop spaghetti onto 1/2 of the bread slices. Place the bread slices without spaghetti on top of spaghetti layer, forming a sandwich. Pour any remaining sauce over sandwiches.",
