    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLine 48 muffin cups with paper liners.\nStir both packages of brownie mix with 1 cup vegetable oil, 4 eggs, and 1/2 cup water in a large bowl until evenly combined and smooth.\nMix strawberry cake mix with 1 cup water, 3 eggs, and 1/3 cup vegetable oil in a separate bowl until moistened. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.\nSpoon about 2 tablespoons brownie batter into the bottom of each prepared muffin cup.\nTop the brownie batter with strawberry cake batter, filling each cup about 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cupcakes spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes.\nCool in pans for about 10 minutes before removing to finish cooling on racks.\nBeat unsalted butter with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a bowl until butter is pale and creamy, about 2 minutes.\nBeat confectioners' sugar into the butter, about 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down sides of bowl as needed. After each addition of confectioners' sugar, raise mixer speed to high to beat as much air as possible into the frosting; reduce speed to low and continue beating until frosting is smooth. Repeat until all confectioners' sugar is incorporated, about 5 minutes of beating time; beat in vanilla extract.\nSpread cooled cupcakes with buttercream frosting.",
