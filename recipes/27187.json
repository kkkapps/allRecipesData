    "ins": "Place chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and cook on high 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until mostly melted.  Transfer to a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat and stir in sugar, salt and butter.   Stir in cream, a little at a time until smooth.  Heat through, without boiling, then remove from heat and stir in vanilla.  Store in refrigerator.",
