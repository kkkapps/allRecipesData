    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse and wash turkey. Discard the giblets or you can add these to pan if these are anyone's favorites.\nPlace turkey in a Dutch oven or roasting pan. Separate the skin over the breast to make little pockets. Put 3 tablespoons of the butter on both sides between the skin and breast meat. This makes for very juicy breast meat.\nCombine the water with the bouillon, and sprinkle in the parsley flakes and minced onion. Pour over the top of the turkey. Sprinkle seasoning salt over the turkey.\nCover with foil and bake in preheated oven for 4 to 5 hours.  For the last 45 minutes or so, remove the foil so the turkey will brown nicely.",
