    "ins": "Preheat your waffle iron.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla, buttermilk and butter until well blended. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, salt and cinnamon; stir into the buttermilk mixture. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff. Fold into the batter.\nSpoon batter onto the hot waffle iron, close, and cook until golden brown. Waffles are usually done when the steam subsides.",
