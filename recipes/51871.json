    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat; brown the pork chops on both sides. Remove the pork chops from the skillet, reserving the drippings in the skillet; add the onion soup mix and the water to the drippings; cook and stir until hot.\nSpread the rice evenly into the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Lay the pork chops atop the rice. Pour the mixture from the skillet over the pork chops and rice; cover.\nPlace covered dish in preheated oven and bake 45 minutes. Remove cover and bake until the pork is no longer pink in the center, another 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
