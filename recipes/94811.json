    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nHeat the cream and vanilla in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Whisk together the egg yolks, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and pumpkin in a bowl. Slowly pour 1 cup of the cream mixture into the egg mixture, stirring continually. Then pour the entire egg mixture into the saucepan; whisk briskly for 1 minute.  Pour the mixture into ramekins. Arrange ramekins on a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until set, about 15 minutes; refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.\nBefore serving, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar over the top of each creme brulee. Use a kitchen torch or your oven's broiler to caramelize the sugar. It may take 2 to 3 minutes in the broiler. Serve immediately.",
