    "des": "\"I got this recipe from my water aerobics instructor. I only make it at Thanksgiving and Christmas. The first year I made it, I was too full for dessert after dinner. I only got to taste the leftover crumbs because my family ate the whole thing Christmas Day. The second year I baked it the night before Christmas and left it on the counter. When I got up Christmas morning, a fourth of it had already been eaten. Serve all by itself or with ice cream and/or fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray and lightly coat with flour.\nWhisk cake mix, pudding mix, 1/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Beat vegetable oil, water, 1/2 cup white wine, and eggs into flour mixture using an electric mixer until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan on a wire rack, about 1 hour.\nCombine 1/2 cup white sugar, butter, 1/4 cup white wine together in a saucepan immediately after removing cake from oven. Cook sugar mixture, stirring constantly, over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon 1/2 the glaze over cake while cake is still warm.\nInvert cooled cake onto a cake plate and spoon remaining glaze over top of cake. Allow cake to absorb glaze, about 15 minutes. Dust cake with confectioners' sugar.",
