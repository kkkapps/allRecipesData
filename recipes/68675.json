    "des": "\"Full flavor gyro meat with a finished texture suitable for slicing and serving on pita with feta cheese, lettuce, sliced black olives, sliced onions and green peppers and served with tzatziki sauce.  The time involved is well worth the effort.\"",
    "ins": "Grind the ground chuck and lamb cubes through the coarse plate of a meat grinder twice to mix thoroughly. Place the onion, garlic, marjoram, rosemary, salt, and pepper into a food processor, and pulse until finely ground. Mix together the ground meat and onion mixture in a bowl. Regrind through a fine plate, and pack the mixture into a 3x7 inch loaf pan. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nRemove and discard the plastic wrap from the loaf pan, and bake the gyro meat in the preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 1 hour. Drain away all of the liquid that has accumulated in the pan, then remove the loaf from the pan. Place the meat on a rack set above a baking dish to catch the drips, and continue baking until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), 15 to 30 minutes more. Remove from the oven, and allow to stand 15 minutes before slicing. The finished loaf should be firm and somewhat dry.",
