    "des": "\"Also known as financiers or friands, these almond-scented, bite-sized cakes are a perfect treat for a mid-morning or afternoon snack. They're prettiest when filled with fresh berries; but if looks aren't important, a teaspoonful of jam works quite well, also.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the cups of a mini-muffin pan.\nMelt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan set over medium heat. Swirl the butter in the pan and continue to cook until it turns golden and smells nutty.\nPour the browned butter into a heat-safe bowl, and let it cool to room temperature.\nIn a separate bowl, stir together the almond flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt.\nMix in the egg whites, honey, almond extract, and browned butter.\nScoop the batter into the prepared muffin cups (a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here). Top each cake with a fresh berry or two (or a dollop of jam).\nBake the cakes for 15 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown around the edge and firm to the touch in the middle.\nRemove the cakes from the oven, and cool them in the pan for 5 minutes before turning them out onto a rack to cool completely.\nRepeat with the remaining batter.",
