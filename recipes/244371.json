    "des": "\"This carrot salad looks absolutely gorgeous and has a sweet, subtle flavor. It's hard to believe anything this simple can be so delicious. Shaving the carrots is a little messy, I admit, but the dish is well worth it.\"",
    "ins": "Using short strokes with a vegetable peeler, shave carrots into thin shavings about 2 inches long.\nWhisk olive oil, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, and cumin together in a bowl; pour over carrots and toss gently with a rubber spatula. Season carrots with salt and pepper; sprinkle with green onions.",
