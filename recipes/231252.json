    "des": "\"The basic recipe was handed down from a friend. I added the sliced onion and substituted the 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with garlic and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup original. I also added the egg noodles which serves the gravy texture wonderfully.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk cream of mushroom soup, water, and onion soup mix in a slow cooker until thoroughly combined.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer onion to a bowl, leaving oil in skillet.\nBrown cube steaks in the hot skillet, about 5 minutes per side. Place cube steaks into slow cooker and top with onions. Cook on Low until cube steaks are tender, 5 to 6 hours.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain. Serve cube steaks and mushroom gravy over egg noodles.",
