    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Return drained macaroni to the pot.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until partially browned, 3 to 5 minutes; add pearl onions, corn, and Italian seasoning. Continue to cook and stir until the beef is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Place a cover on the skillet and cook until the onions are heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and discard excess fat. Add beef mixture to macaroni.\nPour spaghetti sauce over the beef and pasta; stir to coat. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 5 minutes.\nSeason pasta mixture with salt and more Italian seasoning, as needed; top with Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend to serve.",
