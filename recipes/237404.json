    "des": "\"I created my own recipe that turned out delicious! It's a very delicious alternative to a beef burger and actually tastes better. It's easy to make this more or less spicy to your likes. These are also great cooked on the grill. Let me know what you think.\"",
    "ins": "Mix ground turkey, black beans, salsa, garlic, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce together in a large bowl; shape into 4 patties.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over low heat; add onion, increase heat to medium-low, and cook and stir onion until softened and beginning to change color, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer onion to a bowl and set aside.\nHeat remaining olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nTop each patty with some of the onion and a slice of American cheese.",
