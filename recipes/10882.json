    "ins": "Put 4 tablespoons sugar, salt, shortening and orange rind in saucepan with 1 cup hot water.  Bring to a boil. Mix in 1 cup of flour.  Cook until thick, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat, and cool slightly.   Beat in one egg at a time, beating each one in thoroughly before adding another.\nUsing a rose tip, press dough through pastry bag, in desired shape, onto a well-greased square of heavy paper.  Turn paper upside down and let crullers drop into deep, hot fat (375 degrees F - 190 degrees C).  Fry until well puffed up and golden brown in color, about 6 to 7 minutes.  Drain on unglazed paper.  Ice with confectioners' frosting.\nTo Make Frosting:  Cream 1 1/2 tablespoons shortening and continue creaming while slowly adding sugar.  Add cream, salt, and vanilla and mix smooth.",
