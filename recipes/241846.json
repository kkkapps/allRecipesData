    "des": "\"This is my favorite salmon recipe that I put together in college. This can be done on the grill or in the oven. By pairing salmon with rich/tangy lemon, rosemary and garlic sauce, this is a great summertime meal. Serve with grilled/baked veggies (I prefer broccoli, Brussels sprouts or green beans). Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nSeason salmon with seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Arrange salmon in the center of a large piece of aluminum foil; add lemon juice, 4 teaspoons olive oil, and white wine. Top each fillet with 2 lemon slices, capers, and a fresh rosemary sprig. Fold three of the sides of the foil toward the middle, creating a foil bag.\nWhisk mayonnaise, mustard, 2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon zest, chopped rosemary, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.\nCook salmon on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve sauce alongside cooked salmon.",
