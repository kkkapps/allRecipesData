    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix together the ground pork, luncheon meat, chorizo de bilbao, pickle, raisin, eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 2 logs and wrap with aluminum foil. Place the wrapped logs in a baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.\nSet the meatloaves aside to rest. Carefully drain the drippings from the baking dish into a small saucepan placed over medium heat. Stir the soy sauce and corn flour into the drippings; bring to a boil. Cook the mixture at a boil, stirring continually, until the sauce is thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Unwrap the meatloaves and slice; serve the sauce over sliced meatloaf.",
