    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch square baking dish.\nPlace sliced peaches in prepared baking dish. Mix together 1 cup sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and almond extract. Place in oven while preparing shortcake (heating peaches first helps prevent dough from getting soggy).\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk and egg; stir just until flour is moistened. Spread over hot peaches. Sprinkle top with remaining sugar.\nBake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown.",
