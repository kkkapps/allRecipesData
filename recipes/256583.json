    "des": "\"This was an ad hoc creation for someone who couldn't eat strawberries. They are very sweet and 2 to 3 slices satisfies even an ardent sugar monger. The name is inspired by Anthony Wilford Brimley. We eat the slices slightly warm but they can benefit from time in the refrigerator.\"",
    "ins": "Combine 1/3 of the sugar and water in a large skillet over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Add orange slices. Sprinkle some sugar over the exposed side; cook until sugar dissolves into the orange slices, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and repeat on the second side. Drain water.\nFlip orange slices and cover with some more sugar; drizzle some maple syrup on top. Cook until sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and repeat on the second side. Repeat until orange slices appear candied, scraping any melted sugar off the bottom of the skillet and onto the slices. Transfer to a plate and let cool, about 10 minutes.",
