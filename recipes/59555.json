    "des": "\"Alternating slices of sweet and white potatoes baked in cream, butter,  and a touch of cinnamon are a wonderful taste surprise.  This dish was served by friends after my aunt's funeral.  I've made it for several special occasions and it never fails to be a hit.  It is rich, but oh so delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a 9x13 inch baking dish, alternate the sweet potato and red potato slices in overlapping rows to create a checkerboard effect. Pour the cream evenly over the potatoes. Dot with pieces of butter, and sprinkle with cinnamon.\nBake uncovered for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the potatoes are fork tender, and slightly brown around the edges. Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes before serving.",
