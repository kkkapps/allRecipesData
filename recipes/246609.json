    "des": "\"I make this easy-peasy, one-pan pasta dish for new parents or stressed-out friends and it always seems to make the evenings go a little more smoothly. The smoked salmon and green pea combo plays up the salty-sweet flavors loads of people crave, and the lemon zest/breadcrumb topping brightens up what could be an over-the-top rich dish.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace peas in a large colander in the sink.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until chewy and still firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain fusilli over peas.\nReturn fusilli and peas to the pot. Add heavy cream and smoked salmon; mix well to combine. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish.\nCombine bread crumbs, olive oil, parsley, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small bowl; mix lightly with a fork. Scatter topping over casserole.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.",
