    "des": "\"A favorite recipe from my friend Kathleen. This is a quick and easy way to make a flavorful appetizer or a tasty side dish. I take them to office gatherings or serve as a side with a main meal. Everyone loves them. I don't like pickles, but I love these pickled carrots! You can substitute sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda\u00c2\u00ae for the sugar.\"",
