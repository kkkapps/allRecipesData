    "des": "\"I kind of invented this recipe based on how I make my enchilada sauce. I always want to dip my chips in the sauce, so I turned it into a dip! Serve with tortilla chips and/or Fritos\u00c2\u00ae. It is good in tortillas as well.\"",

Add ground beef mixture to enchilada sauce mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce begins to bubble, 15 to 20 minutes. Decrease heat to Low or 'Keep Warm' setting to serve.",
