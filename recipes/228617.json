    "ins": "Mix canola oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, honey, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, Italian herb seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken breasts into the bag, seal, and squeeze bag with your fingers several times to coat chicken with marinade. Place a second resealable bag over the first and seal to prevent leaks. Refrigerate chicken for 2 to 4 hours.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove chicken breasts from bag; discard used marinade. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until the center is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 7 to 8 minutes per side.",
