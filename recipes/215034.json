My large Italian family gathered in the kitchen and tried many ways to prepare Sunday dinner on a tight budget. My friends and family couldn't believe that there is no ground beef in this sauce. I bring it into work the next day and share. Co-workers love it.\n\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large saucepan or soup pot, and cook the garlic, onion, and cauliflower, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower is browned and tender, about 30 minutes. Pour in the basil, black pepper, and crushed tomatoes, and simmer until the sauce is thickened and the flavors have blended, about 30 more minutes.",
