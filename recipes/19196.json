    "ins": "In a very large bowl, cream together the lard and sugar until light and  fluffy. Stir in the molasses and sour cream. Combine the cinnamon, allspice, cloves, baking soda, salt and flour. Stir dry ingredients into the molasses mixture until they are completely absorbed, then fold in the pecans. Cover dough and chill overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out with a half moon cookie cutter or cut into circles, then cut the circles in half. Place cookies at least 1 inch apart onto unprepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
