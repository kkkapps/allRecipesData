    "des": "\"Fresh grouper is my absolute favorite.  It is a mild fish and this recipe may entice even those who don't like fish to make it a favorite. The recipe is super easy and can be served with a minimum preparation and cooking time.  Perfect for a warm summer evening supper. Garnish with lemon twists and parsley before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler.\nPlace the grouper fillets on a greased baking tray. Brush them with lemon juice. In a small bowl, stir together the Parmesan cheese, butter, mayonnaise, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper. Set aside.\nBroil the fillets for 4 to 6 minutes, until they can be flaked with a fork. Remove from the oven and spread the cheese mixture on top of fillets.\nReturn to the broiler for an additional 30 seconds, or until the topping is browned and bubbly.",
