    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nWhisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter and lemon juice until evenly mixed and slightly crumbly. Whisk together the eggs and half-and-half in a small bowl; add 3/4 teaspoons lemon zest with the egg mixture to flour mixture, and mix gently just until well blended and forming a dough. Fold in the huckleberries.\nDivide dough in half, and on a floured surface, shape each half into a ball, then flatten slightly. Cut each round into six wedges; place on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice to make a glaze. Drizzle glaze on cooled scones. Sprinkle with remaining lemon zest for garnish.",
