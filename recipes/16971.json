    "des": "\"The bacon and dates in this simple yet elegant appetizer are wonderful together! My cousin whose husband was stationed in Portugal served these to rave reviews and so have I for 40 years! They are as easy as pie with only 2 ingredients and quick preparation time using round toothpicks.\"",
    "ins": "Slice each piece of bacon vertically in half and wrap each piece around a date; place a wooden toothpick through the bacon and date to secure.\nBroil at approximately 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for about 5 to 10 minutes with broiler tray close to heat source.\nTurn and broil on other side until nicely browned. Serve hot.",
