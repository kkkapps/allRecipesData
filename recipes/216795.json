    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nArrange the chicken pieces in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Season the chicken liberally with salt, pepper, and the paprika; set aside.\nMelt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the apple and onion to the melted butter, season with the curry powder, and cook and stir until the apple and onion are tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the mushroom soup and half-and-half into the mixture until completely combined; spoon over the chicken pieces.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 75 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).",
