    "des": "\"I was looking for a way to have healthier snacks on hand for my kids lunches and on the go snacking. This recipe can be modified to include fruit instead of the chocolate. The date paste helps hold it together nicely and dates are known as nature's candy. No refined sugar except for in the chocolate chips. You could include carob chips or whatever kind of chips your kids like. The dried fruit version is yummy as well!\"",
