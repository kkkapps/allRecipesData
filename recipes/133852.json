    "des": "\"I am from Germany and this was one of our favorite foods to make. Homemade authentic spaetzle with sauerkraut and breadcrumbs sauteed in butter. Delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large pot with water, add oil, and bring to a boil.\nPlace flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle.  Add salt, eggs, and water and beat the dough until smooth and bubbly.  The dough should have a thick consistency.  Fill a spaetzle press with the dough and squeeze into the boiling water (You may use a colander to push the dough through or a wooden cutting board and scrape dough little by little with a knife into the water).\nWhen the spaetzle float to the top of the pot, drain them.  Place half of the spaetzle in a glass baking dish and add a layer of sauerkraut on top.  Add another layer of spaetzle and sauerkraut.  Cover the pan to keep the dish warm.\nIn a separate pan melt the butter and add breadcrumbs just long enough to moisten them.  Top the spaetzle with the breadcrumbs.  Serve all layers together, or reheat the next day in a little bit of butter.",
