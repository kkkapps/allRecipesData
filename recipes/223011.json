Stir in diced tomatoes with green chilies and ranch-style beans and let the mixture simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nPlace a large handful of tortilla chips on a serving dish and top with a ladle of the ground beef mixture. Repeat with remaining chips and meat mixture. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded Mexican cheese blend on each serving.",
