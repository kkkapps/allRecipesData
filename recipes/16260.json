    "des": "\"I love to make this very easy roast. It makes its own gravy and is oh, so tender and juicy! Best if served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Any cut of roast should work fine.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the roast in the oil for 15 minutes, or until all sides are well browned. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.\nPlace the onion, carrots, garlic and parsley in the bottom of a slow cooker. Place the roast on top of the vegetables and pour the soup over the roast and the vegetables.\nCover the slow cooker and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours, stirring once.\nTransfer roast to a serving platter and place the vegetables around it. Pour the roast gravy from the slow cooker into a gravy boat.",
