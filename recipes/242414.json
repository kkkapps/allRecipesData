    "ins": "Heat oil in a wok or heavy pot over medium heat; gently cook and stir pork, breaking up meat as it cooks, until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add squash and salt; cover wok and cook, stirring 2 to 3 times, over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.\nMix chicken broth, water, and chicken bouillon to squash mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender and transparent in the soup, 18 to 20 minutes.\nRemove wok from heat and cool soup slightly. Skim surface to remove accumulated fat. Stir parsley into soup, return soup to a boil, and remove from heat.",
