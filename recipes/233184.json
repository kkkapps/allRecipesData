    "des": "\"Cucumbers and seafood, lightly pickled in rice vinegar, make up this cool and tasty salad that makes a perfect side dish or appetizer. Rice vinegar is an Asian-style vinegar that is milder than distilled or balsamic. Serve with steamed white rice and a cup of fresh green tea.\"",
    "ins": "Lay cucumber slices onto a large plate and sprinkle with salt on both sides. Set aside until water is drawn from the cucumber, about 15 minutes. Brush salt from cucumbers and press with paper towel to remove excess moisture.\nCombine cucumber slices, crab sticks, rice vinegar, and soy sauce in a glass dish bowl; toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 24 hours).\nDivide cucumber salad onto 4 plates; sprinkle each portion with sesame seeds.",
