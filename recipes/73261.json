    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, and saute until tender. Pour in the tomatoes, and cook for a minute, then stir in the ham and heat through. Remove from the heat, and mix in the eggs and parsley. Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Unroll the can of pizza dough on a clean surface, and stretch or roll into a 14x10 inch rectangle. Cut into twelve 3 inch squares.\nPlace equal amounts of the filling into the centers of the squares. Brush the edges lightly with water. Fold in halves to form a triangle, pressing the edges to seal. Place on a greased cookie sheet and prick with a fork.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.",
