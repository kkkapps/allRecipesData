    "des": "\"This soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria) and many of my American as well as Nigerian friends have enjoyed it. It is a great soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give this soup a unique color and flavor. If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds. Any combination of crab, shrimp and smoked fish can be used in place of the shrimp.  Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in place of the beef.\"",
    "ins": "Place pumpkin seeds in a blender and blend for 30 to 40 seconds or until mixture is a powdery paste. Set aside.\nWash beef and cut into bite-size cubes. Season with salt. In large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat for 4  to 5 minutes.
