    "des": "\"Simply delicious! A very unique combination of flavors for this oven char-grilled oyster recipe. It's so good, I get rave reviews every time I make them. People can't get enough of them. Great as an appetizer or the main course. Serving them on a bed of rock salt makes for a nice presentation.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place oysters in a baking pan, flat-side up.\nStir butter, sriracha sauce, garlic, green onions, cilantro, and lime juice together in a bowl.\nBake oysters in the preheated oven until they open slightly, about 10 minutes.\nRemove the top shell of the oysters using a towel and an oyster knife, being careful not to spill the liquor. Gently cut the muscles that attach the oysters to the shell.\nDivide the butter mixture among the oysters, placing a dollop on each. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nBroil oysters in the preheated oven until butter melts and Parmesan cheese is golden brown, about 5 minutes.",
