    "des": "\"My Norwegian grandmother made this for us as a treat, and it continues to be a favorite my mother makes for my kids.  Very easy and versatile.  Serve rolled like a crepe with syrup or jam.  Can also be a dessert stuffed with a sweetened cream cheese and lingon berry mixture.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the eggs and milk in the container of a blender. Add the flour, salt and sugar, and blend until smooth.\nHeat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray or butter. Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, and tilt the pan to coat the bottom. Cook until the top looks dry, about 30 seconds. Carefully slide a spatula under the pancake and flip. Cook for a few seconds on the other side, just until browned. Remove to a plate, and repeat with remaining batter.",
