Try to resist the temptation to add salt, pepper, or other spices, as the blue cheese will provide all the punch you need. We're going for pure blue cheese flavor in a buttery, crunchy package, and anything else would just get in the way.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.\nPlace bread cubes in a bowl and drizzle butter over the top. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the blue cheese over the top and stir until bread is coated. Sprinkle another 1/3 of the cheese over the top and stir to coat again. Spread bread cubes out onto prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until slightly crisp, about 15 minutes. Toss cubes and sprinkle remaining blue cheese over the top. Bake until browned and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes more.",
