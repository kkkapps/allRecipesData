    "des": "\"The original concept is from Nestle\u00c2\u00ae, but this is my version of the Toll House\u00c2\u00ae pie. The original version was dense and greasy; mine is more cake-like. I strongly recommend using miniature chocolate chips, as when I tried it with full-sized ones, they melted and sank to the bottom of the pie and formed a large mass.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nBeat eggs in a mixing bowl until foamy. Add flour, white sugar, and brown sugar; beat into the eggs. Blend butter, milk, and vanilla extract into the egg mixture. Stir walnuts, coconut, and chocolate chips into the egg mixture; pour into the pie shell. Place pie onto a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until cooked through, about 1 hour.",
