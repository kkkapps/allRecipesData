    "ins": "Combine 1-1/2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, salt and garlic powder in a large mixer bowl. Heat water, milk and butter until very warm (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F). Add to dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make a soft dough.\nCover and let dough rest 10 minutes in bowl.\nPortion dough evenly into 12 to 15 greased muffin cups (2-1/2 x 1-1/4 inches).\nTip: Use an ice cream scoop to make portioning easier. Cover; let rise in warm, draft free place until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes.\nCombine egg white with 1 tablespoon water. Carefully brush tops of rolls with egg mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 18 minutes, or until lightly browned on top. Remove from pans and cool on wire rack.",
