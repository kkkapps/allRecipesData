    "des": "\"I was looking around for a name for this unusual clafoutis-like combination of peaches, blackberries, thyme, and black pepper. I saw an article that said in France a clafoutis that uses fruit other than cherries is called a flognarde. I enjoy saying flognarde so much that I think even if this recipe hadn't come out as well as it did I would still make it regularly, just to say 'flognarde'.\"",

Add eggs, vanilla extract, thyme leaves, black pepper, and salt; whisk until batter is smooth.\nSpread blackberries and peach slices out in the prepared casserole dish. Pour batter over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until fruit is hot and batter is set, about 45 minutes. Cool completely.",
