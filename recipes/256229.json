Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.\nBring the macaroni mixture to room temperature, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Pour into a 2-quart baking dish. Sprinkle remaining Gruyere cheese on top.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes.",
