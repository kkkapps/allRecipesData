    "des": "\"This is the best chicken slow cooker recipe ever, and I've tried a lot of them.  I can't remember where I originally got it from; my version has been tweaked a little.  I don't like mushrooms, but the mushrooms in the condensed soup are really big and easy to take out. Serve over hot cooked rice.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the salad dressing mix, mushroom soup, cream cheese, and wine until the sauce mixture is hot, smooth and well combined. Place the chicken breasts into the bottom of a slow cooker, and pour the sauce mixture over the chicken. Cover and cook on Low setting until chicken is tender, about 4 hours.",
