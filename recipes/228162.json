    "ins": "Combine carrots, onion, red potatoes, parsnips, turnips, celery, lentils, garlic, oregano, rosemary, and thyme in a large pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables and lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Add more water if needed.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.\nPour cooked vegetables and lentils into the prepared pan. Gently layer biscuits atop the vegetables. Sprinkle with Colby Jack cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until vegetables are bubbling and cheese is browned, 20 to 40 minutes.",
