It won't make a gourmet dinner, but is perfect for a busy mid-week lunch. Season with freshly chopped basil or parsley (optional); add more salt and pepper to taste.\"",
    "ins": "Combine tomatoes, cucumber, and garlic in a high-powered blend; blend until smooth, 15 to 30 seconds. Add olive oil, hot sauce, salt, and pepper and blend until smooth, 5 to 15 seconds. Add about 1 teaspoon water at a time if mixture is too thick and blend until smooth. Add bell pepper to tomato mixture; blend until finely chopped but not liquified, 1 to 2 seconds.\nChill gazpacho in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Top gazpacho with tuna to serve.",
