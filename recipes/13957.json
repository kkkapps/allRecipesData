    "des": "\"This recipe is from an old family recipe book. I'm sharing it to ensure that it lives on and on. And also, so that others can enjoy it. The original recipe called for fresh corn, but good fresh corn is not always readily available, so I modified it to use canned corn.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet and set aside to cool slightly.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Beat in the milk. Add the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix until just combined.  Add corn, cheese and melted butter from skillet and mix just until combined.\nHeat the same skillet over medium heat until hot. Drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the hot skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve hot with syrup.",
