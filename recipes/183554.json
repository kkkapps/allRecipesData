    "des": "\"Over the years my family has made this dish. I've always known it as jambalaya, but years ago found out it wasn't the traditional jambalaya served in a spicy or zesty tomato-based dish. This is my family's twist on it. We love it very much. It's our comfort food. I've made quicker adjustments on my family's recipe for a faster prep time. And this recipe is scaled down. It's normally twice this size for our huge family.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from pot and set aside.\nMelt the butter in the large pot. Cook the onion, green onion, and parsley in the butter until the onions begin to soften, 4 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken broth, cooked chicken, sausage, and rice; bring to a boil for 2 minutes and then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Do not remove cover or stir while simmering. Serve hot.",
