Fold each tortilla in half to form a half circle.\nLightly coat a large nonstick skillet or griddle with oil.  Cook each quesadilla, over medium-high heat for 1 1/2 minutes on each side until cheese is melted and tortilla is lightly browned.\nCut the quesadilla into 4 wedges and serve with sour cream.",
