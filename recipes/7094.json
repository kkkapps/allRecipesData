    "des": "\"This bread has all the qualities of a quick bread plus great texture and a heavenly crust. The riper the bananas, the better the flavor. Steel-cut oats are the old-fashioned kind that are not pre-cooked, quick-cooking, or instant. You can find them in health food stores or in groceries that carry specialty type items.\"",
    "ins": "Soak the steel cut oats in the boiling water. Let cool to room temperature.\nPlace ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select cycle; press Start. If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the nuts at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.",
