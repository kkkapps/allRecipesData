    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add corned beef hash and break up larger chunks. Cook  until browned on one side, 5 to 8 minutes. Turn and brown other side. Sprinkle with garlic powder and ground pepper. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.\nSpread 1 dough sheet out onto lightly greased sheet of waxed paper. Spread half of the cream cheese over the dough sheet, leaving a 1/2-inch margin all around. Spoon half of the cooked corned beef hash evenly over cream cheese. Roll dough up into a log, starting at a long edge. Repeat steps to make another log with second dough sheet.\nCut each roll into 1/2-inch thick slices (you should end up with 16 rolls total.) Place slices onto an ungreased baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until pinwheels are golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Serve immediately.",
