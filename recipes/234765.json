    "des": "\"This is the most chocolate, most rich, densest, custard-style ice cream ever devised. It's spiked with coffee flavor and with such a powerful taste, it earns the name Nuclear.\"",
    "ins": "Heat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until milk is barely simmering.\nBeat egg yolks in a bowl; gradually stir in about 1/2 cup hot milk mixture. Beat until smooth. Transfer egg yolk mixture back to the saucepan and continue cooking and stirring until thickened, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, melt dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes.\nRemove saucepan from heat and stir melted chocolate into milk-egg mixture; transfer mixture to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until well-chilled, 4 hours to overnight.\nStir cream and vanilla extract into chilled chocolate mixture and pour into an ice cream maker. Freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches \"soft-serve\" consistency. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should be placed in the freezer at least 2 hours or overnight.",
