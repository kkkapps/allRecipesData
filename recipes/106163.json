    "des": "\"This tasty vegetarian sauce is an extremely versatile condiment. Great on sandwiches, in place of enchilada sauce, or used as a marinade. We put this stuff on practically everything! The recipe may seem rather involved but is really quite simple.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the kosher salt and warm water until the salt dissolves, set aside and allow to cool to room temperature. This is called the salmuera.\nCombine the flat leaf parsley, garlic, and olive oil in the bowl of a food processor, and pulse several times to chop up the parsley. Add the roasted red peppers, paprika, oregano, crushed red pepper, black pepper, cumin, white vinegar, and red wine vinegar. Continue to pulse the food processor until the ingredients are well combined, but still chunky.\nTransfer the sauce into a large mixing bowl, and slowly stir in the cooled salmuera. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours to allow the salt to mellow. Sauce can be kept refrigerated in an airtight container for 2 weeks.",
