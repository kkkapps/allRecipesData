    "des": "\"These halibut fillets are stuffed with a mixture of cream cheese and salad shrimp. If the thick filets are not available, you can spread the cream cheese mixture on top of the thinner filets and fold in half, using a tooth pick to keep in place during cooking. The fresher the fish for this recipe, the better!  This is great served with fresh steamed broccoli.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Line a cookie sheet with foil.\nIn a small bowl, mix together cream cheese and shrimp.  Season to taste with basil, salt and pepper.\nMake a pocket in each of the fillets, making sure you do not cut through on three sides.  Divide the cream cheese mixture into 6 parts, and stuff each fillet.  Place on foil lined pan. Squeeze lemon juice over fish.\nBake for 20 minutes, or until fish is thoroughly done.",
