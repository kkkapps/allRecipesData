    "des": "\"Serve this black cheese ball with blue corn chips or dark rye toast for a ghastly presentation. It's punchy, just like you'd expect cheese of the dead to taste. You can find black sesame seeds at a reasonable price at most Asian markets.\"",
    "ins": "In the container of a food processor, combine the Cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, horseradish, hot mustard, chipotle sauce, garlic and port wine. Pulse until smooth. You can use a potato masher in a large bowl but it will take longer.\nLine a bowl with plastic wrap, and fill with the cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.\nToast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat just until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Gather the plastic wrap around the cheese mixture and form into a ball. Remove the plastic wrap and roll the ball in sesame seeds to coat. Place in the center of a platter and surround with your favorite chips or crackers.",
