Pour batter into the prepared pans.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Let cakes cool then remove from pans. Ice with Angel icing and sprinkle with shredded coconut on top and sides of cake after icing.\nTo Make Angel Icing: Place the 2 egg whites, 3/4 cup white sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar and salt in a double boiler over hard boiling water.  Start beating right away with a beater until the mixture stands in stiff peaks.  Remove from heat and add vanilla or your choice of flavoring and keep beating until it is thick enough to spread easily. Spread over cooled cake.",
