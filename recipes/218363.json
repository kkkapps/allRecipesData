My childhood neighbor made it our block party and now, even though I have moved far away, I still make it with fond memories...it just isn't Fourth of July without it! I have seen similar recipes where the white layer is made with sour cream or whipped topping, but this one uses sweetened condensed milk...easy and delicious!\"",
