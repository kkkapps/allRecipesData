    "des": "\"This is my Grandma Valma's recipe that I bring to any holiday/party/shower or gathering, and it is always gone well before anything else. I have friends and relatives call and request that I bring this because they have been craving it since the last party. This is incredibly easy, but the mix of ingredients make this such an awesome appetizer. It may not actually be 7 layers, but that's what Grandma called it so I never argued! I have found that ridged or wavy potato chips are the best to go with this dip. Enjoy!!!\"",

Spread the bean mixture over a large platter in an even layer.\nMix sour cream, mayonnaise, and taco seasoning in a bowl; spread in a layer over the bean mixture. Sprinkle tomatoes and green onions as a single layer, then top with a layer of bean sprouts. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.",
