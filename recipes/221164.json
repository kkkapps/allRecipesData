    "des": "\"This Carolina-style barbeque sauce features fresh apple, but otherwise it's a fairly straightforward, totally in-your-face-with-tang-and-heat recipe. It is fantastic on pulled pork and molasses-brined pork chops.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Place apple pieces in saucepan; cook and stir until they are slightly caramelized, about 2 minutes.\nStir brown sugar into apples; cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture starts to bubble, about 2 minutes.\nPour apple cider vinegar into saucepan. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook until the apples are soft and falling apart, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat.\nWhisk in mustard, red pepper flakes, and black pepper.\nTransfer mixture to blender and puree until completely smooth.",
