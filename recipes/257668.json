    "des": "\"This recipe is adapted from the Omanhene brownie recipe. Omanhene is Ghanaian chocolate so that's where the 'Ghana' comes in. The original recipe uses refined, white sugar - but I replaced that with light brown plus demerara/turbinado sugar - as well as substituting butter for canola oil and whole eggs for just whites. The end result is a brownie with a strong come-on and a very bad attitude. Bake with caution!\"",

Sprinkle cocoa powder into the dish.\nMelt chocolate and butter in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, about 5 minutes.\nWhisk eggs, brown sugar, and demerara sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Stir chocolate mixture into egg mixture until thoroughly mixed. Stir in flour, vanilla extract, and salt into chocolate-egg mixture until thoroughly mixed; pour into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.",
