    "des": "\"These are very juicy and light patties with the secret ingredient - grated Granny Smith apple - that makes all the difference. They are not heavy and meaty, so if you like your patties light, these are for you! Serve on whole meal buns with lettuce, tomato, and chutney.\"",
    "ins": "Toast bread slices in toaster until hard and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and cool on wire rack until no longer warm to the touch, about 10 minutes.\nCrumble toasted bread slices into a large bowl until reduced to fine crumbs, or place in food processor and process until fine.\nCombine chicken, apple, onion, breadcrumbs, egg, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a bowl until well mixed.\nShape mixture into 4 patties. Place flour on a place, coat patties with flour.\nSpray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray, heat to medium. Cook patties until browned on both sides, no longer pink in the center, and juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
