    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace tomatoes onto a large square of aluminum foil. Drizzle olive oil over tomatoes and top with garlic, basil, thyme, and salt. Wrap the foil around tomato mixture sealing tightly to keep juices inside.\nBake in the preheated oven until tomatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Cool slightly.",
