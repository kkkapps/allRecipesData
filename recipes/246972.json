    "des": "\"A fast, fool-proof, recipe for caramel sauce with two simple ingredients that just happens to be paleo, lactose-free, gluten-free and somewhat guilt-free (depending on your diet). Use immediately or put in a covered container and store in the refrigerator up to 3 days. This will harden in the fridge, just reheat to get it pourable again.\"",

Set timer for 4 minutes and stir caramel, constantly scraping down the sides. The bubbles with be airy yet high.\nRemove saucepan from heat precisely after 4 minutes.
