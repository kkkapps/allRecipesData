    "des": "\"I wanted a good meat sauce, but was having trouble finding that one recipe that knocked my socks off, so I altered a few and came up with my own.  Of course, it goes well with all types of pasta and in the traditional Spaghetti ala Bolognese. But I also use this as my sauce in lasagna, baked ziti, pizza - you name it. It gives everything that extra oomph!\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, and cook and stir the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic until the vegetables are soft and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes. Place the ground beef into the pan, and cook and stir, breaking the meat apart as it cooks, until well browned, about 10 more minutes. Pour in the red wine, bring to a boil, and cook until the liquid is almost absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour in the milk and nutmeg, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the milk is almost absorbed, 10 more minutes.\nStir in the crushed tomatoes, sugar, and oregano, bring to a simmer, and reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
