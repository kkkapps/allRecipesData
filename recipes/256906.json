    "des": "\"Lean ground turkey and heart-healthy avocado come together to make eating right delicious. This recipe brings a little Southwestern flavor to the mix, with salsa in the guacamole and a seasoned burger mixture. If you'd like to add cheese, a cheddar-jack or pepper-jack would be perfect. Black bean-corn salad is a great side dish.\"",
    "ins": "To make guacamole, sliced avocados in half, lengthwise. Remove the pit and discard. Scoop out the avocado flesh with a spoon into a bowl.\nAdd juices, chili powder, salsa and salt and mash with a fork until nicely chunky.\nCover with plastic and set aside. (If you want to make the guacamole an hour or so ahead of time, you can keep it fresh in its bowl in the refrigerator by pressing plastic wrap onto the surface of the guacamole so that no air reaches the avocado, which is what makes it turn brown.)\nIn a bowl, combine garlic, salt, pepper, cumin and paprika until thoroughly blended.\nBrush each patty on both sides with olive and sprinkle with the seasoning blend on both sides.\nUsing a skillet or grill pan, cook patties over medium-high heat, covered, about 5 to 6 minutes per side, until no pink remains. If you're adding cheese, do so for about the last 1 minute of cooking.\nBrush each bun on both sides with melted butter and warm in another skillet over medium-high heat for about 15 seconds per side, just until toasty.\nPlace patties on each bun bottom, top with guacamole and other desired trimmings. Serve with a little salsa on the side.",
