    "des": "\"For such a simple recipe with so few ingredients, the flavor is incredibly deep. The onions come out creamy and are the perfect companion to broiled or grilled sausages. This is excellent served with mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions, and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Stir in salt and sugar. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook 20 minutes. Stir in flour, then add broth. Stir well. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and cook 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, prepare oven broiler.\nPlace sausages on a broiling pan; place under the broiler, and cook, turning occasionally, until the skin is dark brown and the sausages are cooked through, about 20 minutes. Pour onion sauce over sausages.",
