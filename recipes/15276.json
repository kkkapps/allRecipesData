    "ins": "Wash and trim Brussels sprouts. Cut an \"X\" about 1/8 inch deep in the stem of the sprouts (this helps cook the sprouts more evenly and quickly).\nIn a medium-size pot, cover Brussels sprouts with water; add 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Cover and simmer for 6 minutes or until tender; drain. Be careful not to overcook sprouts.\nPlace sprouts in a small casserole dish. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of melted butter over the sprouts and mix well to coat.\nCombine Parmesan cheese, dried bread crumbs, garlic powder, black pepper, seasoning salt, and remaining butter and mix well; sprinkle mixture over sprouts.\nHeat sprouts under broiler (about 4 inches away from heat) for about 5 minutes or until crumb mixture is lightly browned. Serve hot.",
