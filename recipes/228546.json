    "ins": "Mix flour, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Dredge the chicken breast pieces in the seasoned flour to coat; tap off excess flour.\nMelt butter in a skillet over medium heat until hot but not starting to brown. Pan-fry coated chicken breast pieces in the hot butter until golden brown, the juices run clear, and the chicken is no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces often. Remove chicken from skillet and keep warm.\nPour white wine into the skillet and scrape pan to dissolve any browned bits of food on the bottom. Mix in lemon juice, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir often. Stir capers into sauce and place chicken back into skillet, turning to coat with sauce.\nTo serve, transfer chicken to a serving platter, top with sauce, and garnish with lemon slices and fresh parsley.",
