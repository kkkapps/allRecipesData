    "des": "\"Yogurt, fresh berries, and a surprise ingredient give this dish a somewhat cheesecake-like flavor but with a fraction of the fat and calories. Let the berry-yogurt mixture chill awhile so flavors mingle and mellow. Make a flavor change by substituting instant white chocolate pudding mix. I've served this for dessert, but it's good as a breakfast treat, too!\"",
    "ins": "Combine the yogurt and pudding mix in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in 2 cups of the mixed berries and the cereal until blended. Pour the yogurt and berry mixture into a 9 inch pie plate. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 2 hours.\nMeanwhile, place the remaining 1 cup of berries in a medium bowl and slightly mash with a fork. Stir in the sugar and lemon juice. Set mixture aside at room temperature.\nSpoon chilled berry-yogurt mixture into serving dishes. Top with a spoonful of mashed berries, and whipped cream, if desired.",
