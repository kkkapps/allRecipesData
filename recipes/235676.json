    "des": "\"This is an easy quiche, sweet and delicious. You could add cream to make it a true quiche. When you cook any squash, it is leisure time. There is no need to watch the oven too closely. You can use chicken instead of turkey if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place squash on a baking sheet. Grease a pie dish.\nBake squash in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool squash until able to touch, about 15 minutes; cut in half, remove seeds, and scoop meat into a bowl.\nMix squash, onion, turkey, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; pour into prepared pie dish.\nBake in the oven until edges become lighter in color and middle is set, 35 to 45 minutes.",
