    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add chops and brown well. Top with apple slices.\nMeanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the sauerkraut, sugar and onion and mix all together. Thicken slightly with cornstarch. Place this mixture over the chops and apples and season with pepper to taste.\nReduce heat to medium low. Cover skillet and cook all for 15 to 20 minutes or until chops are cooked through. Serve hot.",
