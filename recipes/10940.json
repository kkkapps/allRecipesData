    "des": "\"These tea cake cookies are great for letting children frost them because they don't crumble easily.\"",
    "ins": "Cream together eggs, butter, sugar and baking powder.  Stir in the flour.  Dough will be stiff.\nShape in walnut sized balls and flatten with the bottom of a glass.\nPlace on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes.  If you brown them, you've overbaked them.  These may also be rolled out and cut with cookie cutters.",
