    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and set aside.\nMix artichoke hearts, walnuts, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, basil, and oregano in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Add farfalle and stir to coat.",
