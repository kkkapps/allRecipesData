    "des": "\"This dish originated in Africa but my mother and her relatives prepared it in Alabama. Kingombo is the name of okra in the African Bantu language and patata is the name of potato in Spain. I combined the two words together to name my dish. This is a wonderful okra and potato dish that can used as a side dish or it can be eaten for breakfast. Enjoy kingombo patatas!\"",
