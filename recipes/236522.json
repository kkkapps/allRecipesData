    "des": "\"My family loves deviled eggs, so I decided to make a little twist on our regular recipe, inspired by the flavors of Buffalo chicken. They are spicy, but not too spicy for my young kids, and it's easy to change the level of spiciness to suit your taste.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.\nCut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in ranch dressing and hot Buffalo sauce until smooth. Spoon yolk mixture into a resealable plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag.\nPlace egg white halves cut-side-up on a serving platter; pipe yolk mixture into whites. Sprinkle with cayenne pepper. Cut celery into tiny stalks and place one on top of each egg.",
