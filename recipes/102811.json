    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a quiche dish or a 9-inch pie pan, and set aside.\nPlace the zucchini, onion, eggs, Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper into the work bowl of a food processor, and process for about 1 minute, until all the ingredients are finely chopped and blended. Add the flour and baking powder, and process 1 more minute, scraping the side of the bowl if necessary. Place the mozzarella cheese into the work bowl, and process for about 1 minute, to combine the cheese thoroughly into the mixture.\nScrape the mixture into the prepared quiche dish, sprinkle with paprika, and bake for 1 hour, or until set. The quiche is done when a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.",
