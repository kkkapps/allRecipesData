    "ins": "Heat lemon juice, water, sugar, lemon zest, and cornstarch in a pot over medium heat. Simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes; remove from heat.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes.\nPour the lemon syrup into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top.\nRun a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles.\nWipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.\nProcess jars in boiling water in a large pot for 10 minutes; remove jars from pot and allow to cool.\nOnce cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight.",
