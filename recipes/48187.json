    "ins": "Place the chicken in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Pour in the apple juice. Blend in cloves, curry powder, cinnamon, and garlic powder. Mix in the raisins.\nCook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. The juice will form a glaze over the chicken. Drizzle with the remaining apple juice mixture to serve.",
