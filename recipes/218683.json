    "des": "\"A very unusual potato salad, but it is fabulous! It is, by far, one of the easiest potato salads to make, and everyone always wants the recipe. Don't be fooled by the ingredients, it is full of flavor! This is a must try. When taking to a pot luck, make sure you have copies of the recipe with you.\"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice about 1/4 inch thick; refrigerate until cool.\nSpread about 1/2 cup of mayonnaise on the bottom and up the sides of a large salad bowl. Place half the potato slices into the salad bowl in a layer. Generously season with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle half the green onions over the potatoes; layer half the cottage cheese and half of the remaining mayonnaise. Repeat layers and end with mayonnaise; spread the mayonnaise over the salad to seal in the layers.\nSprinkle black pepper over the top of the salad, and cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight. Toss well before serving.",
