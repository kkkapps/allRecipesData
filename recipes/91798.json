    "ins": "Cook each potato in the microwave until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 8 minutes. Allow potatoes to cool, then slice in half lengthwise.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nScoop out the centers of the potato halves, leaving about 1/2 inch of potato in the skin to keep its shape. Place skins on a greased baking sheet and place the scoopings into a bowl. Mash the potato in the bowl with milk, salt, pepper and butter until smooth, or as smooth as you prefer. Stir in the green and red peppers, jalapeno and garlic until evenly distributed. Mound the mixture into the potato skins. Sprinkle cheese and bacon bits over the top.\nBake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is starting to toast.",
