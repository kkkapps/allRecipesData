    "ins": "Bring a pot of water to a boil over medium heat, and cook the zucchini until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the zucchini in a colander set in the sink, and set aside to cool.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nCombine 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1/2 cup of very soft butter in a bowl until crumbly and well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.\nMeasure out 3 cups of cooked zucchini, and place into a blender. Pour in the evaporated milk and eggs, and add 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 1/4 cup of flour, 1 tablespoon of butter, and the vanilla extract to the zucchini. Pulse the blender several times to combine the ingredients, and then blend until the filling mixture is pureed, about 1 minute. Pour the mixture over the crust. Combine 1 tablespoon of sugar with the cinnamon in a small bowl, and sprinkle over the filling.\nBake in the preheated oven until the middle of the dessert is set, about 45 minutes. Let cool, and chill in refrigerator before slicing.",
