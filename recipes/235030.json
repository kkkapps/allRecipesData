Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.\nDrop by heaping teaspoonfuls egg mixture onto a baking sheet, making little peaked mounds.\nBake in preheated oven until lightly browned and dry on the outside yet soft and no longer gooey on the inside, 15 to 20 minutes.",
