    "des": "\"I posted this recipe for the glaze. It will work on any size ham, but cooking times will vary depending on the size and how you like to cook your ham. It is a thick, rich glaze. I only use the water packaged with the ham when I make it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine 2/3 cup horseradish mustard, bourbon, brown sugar, honey, and liquid smoke together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer glaze, stirring frequently, until thickened, at least 30 minutes.\nLiberally coat ham with the remaining horseradish mustard and place in a roasting pan. Spoon glaze over ham.\nBake in the preheated oven, basting occasionally, until until the internal temperature of the ham has reached 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), about 2 hours. (Generally bake 22 minutes per pound.)",
