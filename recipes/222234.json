    "ins": "Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut in cold butter with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in water and vodka, if using. Toss with a fork until flour mixture is moistened, then use your hands to bring dough together into a ball. Flatten into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\nRoll dough into a large disk about 13 inches wide and 1/8-inch thick. Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet.\nPour cherry filling into the middle of the dough, leaving a 3-inch border. Fold the outside edge of the dough over the fruit, making occasional pleats.\nBrush milk over dough; generously sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and the fruit is bubbling, 35 minutes.",
