    "ins": "In a shallow dish, soak chicken thighs in soy sauce. Squeeze juice from the lemons into the dish. Let stand for at least 10 minutes.\nWhile the chicken is marinating, melt butter in a large skillet or wok.  Add garlic and fry until tender. Add chicken thighs and cook on medium high until the juices run clear, about 20 to 25 minutes.\nServe over white rice with pan drippings.",
