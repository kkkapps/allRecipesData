Arrange chocolate pieces and marshmallows onto one of the banana halves and sandwich between the two halves. Wrap foil around the banana to secure together.\nPlace the foil packet directly on the hot coals of your campfire and cook until the chocolate and marshmallow are melted, 2 to 3 minutes.\nRemove packet from fire and let cool a few minutes before serving directly from the foil packet.",
