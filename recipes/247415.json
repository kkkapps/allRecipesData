    "des": "\"This recipe is wonderful combination of peanut butter and pretzels made even more divine by dipping each sandwich in melted creamy vanilla candy melts. The mixture of sweet and salty is heavenly.\"",
    "ins": "Line a baking sheet with wax paper. Arrange 24 pretzel crisps face down on the sheet.\nScoop 1 teaspoon peanut butter on each pretzel crisp. Top with the remaining pretzel crisps face up pressing down lightly to flatten into a \"sandwich.\"\nMelt chips or melts in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.\nUse small tongs to dip each \"sandwich\" into the melted candy (or use a fork or spoon to drizzle the coating over it.) Let excess coating drip into the bowl; place dipped sandwiches onto the baking sheet.\nLet stand until the candy sets. You can speed up the process by placing them in the refrigerator.",
