    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFlatten dough portions into rounds. Separate minced jalapeno pepper into 8 portions; press each dough round into 1 portion jalapeno pepper so that peppers are imbedded in one side of the dough. Place dough, pepper-side up, on a baking sheet.\nSprinkle mozzarella cheese over the top of each dough round and top with salt.\nBake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes.",
