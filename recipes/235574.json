    "des": "\"After going with my wife and young daughter to pick some apples, I decided to experiment with our bounty of crisp New York apples. This was a hit with my little girl, my wife, and her parents! I served this as a soup course preceding roasted pork with sauerkraut, and it was great. I'll make again with some good bread as a soup meal.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook shallot in hot oil until softened; add apples and saute until hot, about 1 minute. Transfer apple mixture to a stockpot.\nPour chicken broth and water into the stockpot; add nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the apples are tender, about 15 minutes.\nStir butternut squash into the liquid. Bring mixture to a gentle boil while stirring occasionally. Stir half-and-half, butter, and tarragon into the liquid; cook, stirring continually, until the butter melts and the liquid is about to boil, about 5 minutes.",
