    "des": "\"These crispy savory cakes are a unique and tasty way to enjoy daikon radish. Like an Asian twist on a modified latke recipe. If you like spiciness and the bitter taste of radish, you'll love this recipe. If not, give it a try anyway, dipped in ketchup, sour cream, miso mayo, jam, or whatever floats your boat.\"",
    "ins": "Place the daikon in a large bowl and sprinkle with the salt. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nDrain daikon. Stir in the garlic, onion, egg, bread crumbs, pepper, paprika, and chili garlic sauce. Mix well. Form into 8, small round patties.\nPour oil into a large skillet. Heat over medium heat. Fry patties in the hot oil until firm and nicely brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.",
