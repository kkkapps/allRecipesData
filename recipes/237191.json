    "des": "\"This is quite an easy crust to make. No waiting for the dough to rise; simply pour and spread on parchment paper and top with the beautiful and delicious toppings described here. Add salt for taste as desired because this is an initially low-sodium pizza. The healthiest, most closely authentic Italian crispy-thin-crust pizza you'll find. Say that fast! I have a very similar chicken spinach Alfredo pizza that's even better tasting.\"",
    "ins": "Season chicken on all sides with smoked paprika, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a baking stone on the lowest rack in the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nProcess oats in a blender until powdered. Add milk, extra-virgin olive oil, egg whites, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic, and anise seed; blend until dough is just combined and pourable. Pour dough onto prepared baking sheet and use a spoon to spread dough into desired shape.\nSpray dough with olive oil cooking spray; top with chicken strips, tomato slices, spinach, mushroom, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes.\nPlace baking sheet on the baking stone in the preheated oven and bake until chicken strips are cooked through, about 10 minutes.\nTop pizza with basil and cheese, close the oven door, and turn off the oven. Let pizza sit in the oven until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer pizza on the parchment paper directly to the baking stone, cut pizza into 8 slices, and space the slices about 1-inch apart on the parchment paper. Close the oven door and let pizza sit in the oven until crust crisps and moisture evaporates, about 5 minutes more.",
