And this version, with a spicy kick, actually has pumpkin in it! Cooking the pumpkin and the spices in the saucepan eliminates any raw squash flavor and makes the spices toastier. And the black pepper gives this latte a nice kick.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk almond milk, pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, and pepper together in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is almost boiling; remove from heat and whisk until frothy, about 1 minute. Divide mixture between 2 mugs.\nSlowly pour coffee into each mug. Top with whipped cream and pinch pumpkin pie spice.",
