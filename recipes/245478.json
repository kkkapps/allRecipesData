    "des": "\"My Persian neighbor introduced me to kofta about 20 years ago. His were made of beef and I never actually got his recipe but I'm pretty good at replicating flavors and these came pretty  close...and of course using turkey instead of beef makes these a lot lighter.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCombine ground turkey, onion, garlic, cilantro, egg, chile pepper, coriander, paprika, chili powder, and salt together in a large bowl; mix thoroughly.\nDivide turkey mixture into twelve 1/4-cup portions, roll into log-shaped ovals, and place on a baking sheet.\nGrill ovals over indirect heat on middle rack, turning occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
