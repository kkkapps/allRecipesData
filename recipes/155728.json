    "des": "\"These thin, crispy spice cookies are a Christmas tradition in Sweden. They're usually cut into heart, flower or star shapes. Dusting your cookie cutters with flour will make it easier to cut the dough.\"",
    "ins": "Sift the flour together with the baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamom in a mixing bowl.\nBeat the butter together with the white and brown sugars in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in the egg and corn syrup until smooth. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until evenly blended. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and wrap tightly each with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.\nUsing 1 portion at a time, work on a floured surface and roll out dough to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into shapes with cookie cutter, and place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until set, about 5 minutes. Cool completely. Store in tightly covered tins.",
