    "ins": "Preheat oven to broil.\nIn a large bowl, combine the ground beef, onion, salt, ground black pepper and basil; mix together well. Then add the bread crumbs, cheese and teriyaki sauce. Mix this together well and divide into 4 to 6 large, round balls.\nPlace the hamburger balls onto a broiler pan, evenly spaced. Press down on each ball, either with your palm or with a spatula, until a perfectly round patty is formed.\nBroil for 8 minutes, turn each patty over, and broil for 8 minutes more. (Note: The outside of each patty should appear almost burnt.)\nTurn off heat and place cheese slices on each patty. When cheese is melted, remove from oven and serve on onion rolls.",
