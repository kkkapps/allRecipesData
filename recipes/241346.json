    "des": "\"I learned to love sesame-flavoured jellyfish from having it at Chinese banquets growing up. Now I make this variation of jellyfish salad with chopped or grated veggies and a spicy sesame sauce. This makes a refreshing and delicious side dish or Chinese-style shared dish. Jellyfish is flavourless, but it is delightfully crunchy and lends itself to various flavour combinations. Serve chilled or at room temperature.\"",
    "ins": "Rinse and drain jellyfish; place into a bowl.\nWhisk sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, chili oil, and ginger together in a small bowl; stir into jellyfish and marinate 15 minutes.\nPlace sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium-low heat; toast until golden, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.\nStir cilantro and green onions into jellyfish mixture; sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve immediately.",
