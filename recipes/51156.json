    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a small bowl, stir together half of the sour cream and the green salsa. Spread enough to coat the bottom into a 9x13 inch baking dish. On each tortilla, spread a small amount of the salsa and sour cream in the center. Lay a small handful of spinach over that, and sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Roll up, secure with a toothpick and place into the baking dish. When all of the tortillas are in the pan, pour the remaining salsa over the top and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the enchiladas are browned and heated through.",
