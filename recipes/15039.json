    "ins": "In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the corn syrup and egg yolk. Gradually stir in the flour until fully incorporated. Cover and chill for at least 1/2 hour.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.\nRoll dough into 1 inch balls, dip them in the egg white, then roll them in the nuts. Place cookies on the prepared cookie sheet 2 inches apart. Using your finger, make an indention in the center of each cookie.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Fill each indention with a small amount of jam while cookies are still warm. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets.",
