    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Add chicken and stir until coated. Stir garlic and red pepper flakes into chicken-bacon mixture; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes.\nPour chicken broth and grape juice over chicken mixture; reduce heat to low and cook until warmed, about 5 minutes. Add about 3 spoonfuls broth mixture to egg yolks; whisk until egg yolks are warmed. Pour egg yolk mixture into broth mixture; cook and stir over low heat until smooth.\nStir Parmesan cheese and Asiago cheese into egg-broth mixture; cook and stir until cheeses are melted and sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Add spaghetti to sauce and mix well.",
