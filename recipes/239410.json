    "ins": "Place coleslaw mix in a large, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High until mix is wilted, 5 minutes. Let cool.\nStir in the shrimp, garlic, pepper, Diamond Crystal(R) Fine Sea Salt, soy sauce, and onion powder into the coleslaw. Mix until well blended.\nPlace one wrapper on a flat surface with a corner pointing toward you. Lightly brush the four corners with a little water. Place second wrapper, about one inch off center to the right, on top of the first wrapper.\nPlace about 1/3 cup vegetable mixture in the center of the stacked wrappers. Bring up bottom corners to cover just over the mix but not all the way to the top corners. Dab wrapper with a little water. Pack filling inside well and fold in the 2 sides till just about touching.\nWet the remaining top corners with a little water and roll the filled wrapper portion tightly toward it and press to seal.\nHeat oil in a large pot to about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) or medium high heat.  Fry egg rolls, turning occasionally, until golden brown 5 to 7 minutes.\nDrain on paper towels and cool slightly before eating. Serve with soy sauce and hot mustard for dipping, if desired.",
