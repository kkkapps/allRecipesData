    "des": "\"Tonja was born in the 1940's and this is her cousin Toni's boyfriend's grandmother's eggnog, so I'm guessing this is from  the mid-1800's and probably dates much earlier. The original recipe called for half milk and half cream, but I use half and half.  Delicious and simple, but be warned, Granny apparently liked a kick!  I've made it from scratch and with the modern equivalents and it's fantastic either way.  Do yourself a favor and use a mixer for everything.  Those who like eggnog LOVE this recipe.  I never leave a party with leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in the bourbon, rum, half and half and nutmeg.\nIn a separate chilled bowl, whip the cream until it can stand in a peak. Fold the whipped cream into the egg mixture. Pour into a plastic container and refrigerate overnight (if possible). Shake the container before serving.",
