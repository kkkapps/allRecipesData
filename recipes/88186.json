    "des": "\"Colorful vegetables and the flavors of lemon and thyme make this orzo dish great for picnics. You can chop the zucchini and carrot instead of grating them to cut down on prep time, just be sure to cook them for a few minutes longer before adding the orzo.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a pot over medium heat. Stir in orzo, and cook 2 minutes, until golden. Stir in garlic, zucchini, and carrot, and cook 2 minutes. Pour in the broth and mix in lemon zest. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 10 minutes, or until liquid has been absorbed and orzo is tender. Season with thyme and top with Parmesan to serve.",
