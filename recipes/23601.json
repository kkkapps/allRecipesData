    "des": "\"This is a basic mild pasta sauce my mother made for years and is still a family favorite.  You can add browned ground beef, mushrooms, grated carrots, zucchini or other veggies. We especially like mushrooms or ground beef.   It's easy and quick but as with most things like this, the longer and slower it simmers the better it tastes.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet over medium heat, saute' onion and garlic in the olive oil for about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce, oregano, salt, pepper, cheese sauce and water.  Lower heat and simmer until it thickens; about 30 minutes.",
