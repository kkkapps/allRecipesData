    "ins": "Mix cream cheese, sour cream, green onions, and taco seasoning in a bowl until well blended. Spread a thin layer of the cream cheese mixture onto each tortilla. Roll each tortilla tightly to create a long tube. Spread more of the cream cheese mixture on the edges of the tortilla to seal. Freeze rolls on a baking sheet for 20 minutes for easier slicing. Cut each roll into 1-inch pieces and thaw before serving.",
