    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until lightly browned but still soft, about 5 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nPreheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nCoat a large baking dish or cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nArrange lemon slices in a single layer on the bottom of the baking dish.\nStir remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, kosher salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl.\nToss Brussels sprouts in lemon juice mixture to coat; transfer to the prepared baking dish with a slotted spoon, draining excess liquid back into the bowl.\nPlace bacon on top of the Brussels sprouts.\nToss potatoes in the same lemon juice mixture used for the Brussels sprouts.\nRemove potatoes with slotted spoon and arrange along the inside edge of the baking dish.\nCoat chicken breast halves thoroughly in the remaining lemon mixture.\nPlace chicken breasts skin-side up in the skillet; pour any remaining lemon juice mixture over chicken.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
