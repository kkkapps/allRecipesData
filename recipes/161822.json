    "des": "\"My hubby and his co-workers needed a tasty and healthy alternative to lunch. The flavors come together wonderfully in this veggie sandwich. It is a true California flavor explosion! This is a great sandwich to eat during Lent when you can't eat meat, or for a vegetarian meal anytime. You may toast the bread if you like, or add lettuce, cheese, or bacon.\"",
    "ins": "Arrange four of the bread slices on a flat surface; top each slice with two slices of orange, even amounts of avocado slices, and even amounts of sprouts. Sprinkle each sandwich with 1/2 teaspoon of balsamic vinaigrette. Top each with remaining bread slices and serve.",
