    "des": "\"This simple way of making a beef reduction takes two days, but requires very little work. We buy a hind quarter of beef every 2 months. I use this recipe to make use of the leftover bones from the leg section. I don't add any vegetables or spices with this because I want to be able to control the flavor of sauce I want later. This simply creates a good starting point for a sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the bones and water in a large stockpot. Bring the mixture to a boil. Maintain a low boil for 24 hours, adding water to keep the bones submerged. Remove and discard the bones. Allow mixture to simmer another 21 to 22 hours. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh colander and return to the stockpot. Bring to a boil and cook until liquid has reduced to about 2 quarts.\nTransfer the stock to heat-safe containers; freeze. Once frozen, there should be three easily-discernable layers. Remove and discard the top-most of those three layers. Thaw remaining portion to use.",
