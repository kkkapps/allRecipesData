    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat eggs in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread the French fried onions on a plate. Dip each chicken breast into the egg, then coat one side of the chicken breast with the fried onion. Place chicken with onions on top on a 9x13 inch baking pan.\nBake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place one slice of provolone cheese on top of each chicken breast and return the pan to the oven, baking until the cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.",
