    "des": "\"Although 'creamy' tells us it probably isn't healthy, these combined healthy ingredients provide a creamy texture that I just can't resist. After wanting to recreate a lentil salad I had from a local market, I realized I had made a salad more delicious than I had intended and it was nothing like I had been attempting to make. This salad is great as a side dish, a main salad, served on top of brown rice, or on top of a bed of lettuce.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and lentils to a boil in a saucepan; cook until lentils are tender, 15 to 25 minutes. Drain and transfer cooked lentils to a large bowl.\nMix cucumber, yellow bell pepper, cilantro, olive oil, feta cheese, dill, sea salt, and black pepper into lentils until fully incorporated. Refrigerate until completely cooled.",
