    "des": "\"This is the recipe for the authentic pesto from Sicily. It combines a traditional pesto with Sicilian delights: ricotta cheese and tomatoes. It has a light and refreshing flavor. Enjoy it with tubular pasta so the pesto finds its way inside the tubes for a burst of Sicilian flavor with every bite! Seeding the tomatoes first allows the mixture to be thicker so it sticks better to the pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Combine Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, olive oil, basil leaves, pine nuts, and garlic in a mortar. Crush with a pestle until pesto is finely ground, but not too smooth.\nMix pesto, cherry tomatoes, and ricotta cheese together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.",
