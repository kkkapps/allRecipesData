    "des": "\"This recipe was passed on to my mom from her dear friend Erika Brooks who was an amazing cook, baker, and cake decorator in 1984. This recipe is based on the famous Frango\u00c2\u00ae candy that was sold at the Bon Marche in Seattle, WA. I have substituted other extracts for different flavors. If I want a pretty look, I pipe the chocolate into small candy papers with a pastry tip. The result is a soft smooth chocolate candy.\"",
