    "des": "\"I have been on a permanent quest to find the perfect quiche recipe. As a self-professed breakfast food, cheese, and egg lover, quiche represents to me all that is right and good in a culinary concoction. Traditionally quiche is not a healthy option, what with all the cream and cheese that typically goes into it. I have literally experimented with different versions of a healthier quiche for years, but a couple of weeks ago I stumbled upon the perfect mixture, and I am pleased to share it here with all of you.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Unroll pie crust and press into an 8-inch pie dish.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green onions until wilted and beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Spread ham over prepared pie crust and top with green onions.\nWhisk egg substitute, evaporated milk, and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Pour over ham mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and garnish with chives.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Increase heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until quiche is browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow quiche to rest until eggs are set, about 30 minutes more.",
