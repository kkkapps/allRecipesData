    "des": "\"With simple stuff...comes a moist, down-home and wholesome meal, snack, or a fun side dish. I serve this up next to pulled pork sandwiches or as the main event alongside mac and cheese. Can't think of anything more Americana than beans and weenies...unless it's a chili corn dog! Top with shredded Cheddar cheese, it'll make you want to slap your mama.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green bell pepper, onion, and celery in hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in hot dog pieces and cook and stir until hot dogs begin to brown, 6 more minutes. Stir in the chili and heat the mixture thoroughly.\nBeat cornbread mix, egg, and milk in a bowl with a spoon until batter is just moistened, and spread half the cornbread batter into the prepared baking dish. Top batter with the hot dog mixture; spread remaining half of cornbread batter over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and cornbread topping is golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.",
