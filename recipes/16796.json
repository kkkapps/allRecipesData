Bake in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until it begins to soften, approximately 30 to 45 minutes.\nRemove squash from the oven and turn onto a plate so that the flesh is facing upwards. Place butter and brown sugar into the squash, and place remaining squash over the other piece. Place squash in a baking dish (so the squash won't slide around too much) while baking.\nPlace squash in the 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven and bake another 30 minutes.",
