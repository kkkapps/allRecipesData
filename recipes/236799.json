Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the potatoes are completely tender, about 25 minutes.\nPour potato mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Stir cayenne pepper and salt into the soup.",
