    "des": "\"This is an unbelievably delicious and quick salmon recipe. You can play around with the ingredients: add fresh basil leaves instead of the chili or balsamic instead of the lemon juice. The wholegrain mustard is essential. You are guaranteed to love this one! Serve with a green salad, and enjoy!\"",
