    "des": "\"This recipe was devised when I had a lot of limes on hand. I'm sure you could use any citrus fruit you like. The key is using healthy ingredients! This muffin is a moderately sweet breakfast treat but much healthier than sweet cereal. The coconut oil is very healthy for you, and so is the flaxseed. Never use margarine! Always use non-aluminum baking powder. I use white whole wheat flour, it comes from white wheat instead of red wheat. These are always a hit at my house.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 10 Texas-size muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.\nWhisk sugar, coconut oil, and grapeseed oil together in a bowl. Add eggs and lime zest; whisk until smooth.\nWhisk whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, flaked coconut, flaxseed, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir milk and lime juice together in another bowl.\nWhisk milk mixture into sugar mixture. Gently fold flour mixture into sugar mixture until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer muffins to wire racks to cool.",
