    "ins": "Stir together the soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger.  Toss frog legs in marinade to coat evenly, then set aside to marinate for 1 hour.\nDrain the frog legs well, reserving marinade.  Season with salt and pepper, and toss with cornstarch to coat.\nHeat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the legs until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes per side.  While the legs are cooking, bring the marinade to a simmer in a small saucepan, and simmer for 3 minutes.\nTo serve, pour sauce over the frog legs and sprinkle with sliced green onion.",
