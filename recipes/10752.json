    "des": "\"This recipe was given to me by my mom-in-law.  The natural preserves provide the flavor.   Store these cookies covered in refrigerator, because of the cream cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Place cream cheese in a mixing bowl, and beat til light and fluffy.  Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the fruit preserves, and form into a flat disk.  Chill overnight.\nRoll dough out onto a lightly floured board, and cut circles using a medium sized glass.\nIn the center of each circle, add 1/2  teaspoon of preserves; crimp edges tightly together.  Natural preserves have a tendency to spill out due to the lower sugar content, but still make a great cookie.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 17 minutes.",
