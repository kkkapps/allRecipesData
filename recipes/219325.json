    "ins": "In a large pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil, and cook the skinned bratwurst until browned, breaking the sausage up into chunks as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Stir in the onions and garlic, and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 more minutes. Mix in fennel seed and sauerkraut with juice, and allow the mixture to pan-fry for 2 minutes without stirring.\nMix in the rice and soup base, and stir until the rice is colored and the soup base is incorporated, about 2 more minutes. Stir in water, black pepper, and raisins, and bring to a boil; cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until rice is tender and almost all the water has absorbed, about 30 minutes.",
