    "des": "\"Taramosalata is a classic Greek appetizer (meze). Satisfyingly delicious, it goes a long way as a party nibble and is also nice to have in the fridge for a quick lunch with some olives and a salad on the side. Fish roe is high in Omega 3 and Vitamin B12, and this is a great way to enjoy it.\"",
    "ins": "Place bread in a bowl, cover with water and let sit until the bread is well soaked, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain water from the bowl and squeeze all of the excess water from the bread.\nCombine bread, olive oil, onion, and lemon juice in a food processor; process until smooth and homogeneous. Add tarama and process until well combined.",
