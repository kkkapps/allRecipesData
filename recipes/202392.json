    "des": "\"This is a really easy recipe that tastes great. Fresh veggies in a light sautee. You can add a cup of cooked pasta if you wish to give it more heft as a side dish. We always make too much pasta during the week so this is a great way to work through some of the leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion in the melted butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic; cook and stir 1 minute more. Stir the tomatoes and 1/4 cup water into the mixture; cover. Cook until the tomatoes have reduced slightly, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.\nPour another 1/4 cup water into the skillet, and add the bouillon cube; stir until the bouillon is dissolved. Add the zucchini; continue cooking until the zucchini is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with black pepper to serve.",
