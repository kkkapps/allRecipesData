    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe the first week of October, when I was participating in a chili cook-off in Mountain Home, ID. Came out great and every judge and taster enjoyed it. It will have the authentic chili flavor with a little 'twist.' This recipe should be started the night before you wish to serve it.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the green bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the sirloin roast to the pepper mixture and continue cooking until the beef is completely browned, 25 to 30 minutes.\nStir the chili beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, chili powder, cumin, nutmeg, salt, black pepper, lime juice, and Worcestershire sauce into the pot; reduce heat to medium-low and cook 3 to 5 hours. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly before chilling in refrigerator overnight.\nBefore serving, return pot to stove over medium-low heat; cook another 3 to 4 hours.",
