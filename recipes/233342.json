    "des": "\"This recipe is a childhood favorite that my grandma passed to my mom and now I am passing to my own kids! It is quick and easy, and great for summer picnics. Plus, the little ones are fascinated when I tell them the boiling water is the 'mystery' behind the cake. Also great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!\"",
