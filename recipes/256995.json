    "des": "\"This easy recipe is an adaptation of the classic, but is even easier to make. Don't be alarmed by the Guinness\u00c2\u00ae - it's simply used to develop the texture of the cake by making it extra dense and moist. This cake almost ends up pudding-like, and goes down a treat when served with cream or ice cream. This proves that a bakery-quality cake can be made so easily at home!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch cake pan with parchment paper; grease parchment paper.\nCombine stout beer and butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat; heat until butter melts and beer looks glossy, 3 to 5 minutes.\nRemove beer mixture from heat; whisk in sugar and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cocoa powder until dissolved and smooth. Whisk in 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream. Mix in eggs and vanilla extract until well blended. Add baking soda; mix in flour gradually until batter thickens and no lumps remain, about 5 minutes.\nPour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool cake before serving, at least 4 hours.",
