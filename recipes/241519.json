    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace brown sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll each banana quarter in the brown sugar until coated. Wrap a lumpia wrapper around each coated banana, sealing the last edge to the roll using a spoon or your finger dipped in water. Repeat with the remaining bananas and wrappers.\nWorking in batches, fry lumpia in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer cooked lumpia to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Some sugar may leak out the sides of the lumpia while cooling.",
