    "des": "\"This is an old-fashioned recipe passed down from my grandmother. When she told me the recipe, my mouth dropped. You mean you actually put a potato in this candy? Yes, you actually use a potato. The candy is very rich but it tastes so good.\"",
    "ins": "Place potato into a saucepan with enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook potato until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.\nTransfer potato to a large bowl and mash with a fork until smooth.\nGradually stir confectioners' sugar into mashed potato a little at a time until the mixture forms a stiff dough. The dough will be runny until all the powdered sugar is used.\nPlace a large square of waxed paper onto a work surface. Roll or press dough into a 12-inch square rectangle on the waxed paper.\nSpread peanut butter over top of dough, covering it entirely.\nPick up one edge of waxed paper and start rolling the dough to make a 12-inch-long log. Wrap log tightly with waxed paper.\nRefrigerate for 1 hour. Unwrap log and slice candy into cross-sectional pieces about 3/4-inch thick to serve.",
