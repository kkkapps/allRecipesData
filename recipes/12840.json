In a separate pot of lightly salted water, boil the prawns and squid until opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet. Place chicken pieces in the skillet, fry them until they are golden brown. Remove the chicken pieces from the skillet and set aside.\nPlace garlic, peppers and tomato cubes into the skillet that the chicken was just removed from. Fry the vegetables until they soften.\nBring the fish stock and  3 cups salted water to a boil and mix in 3 cups rice, saffron and paprika. Bring to a boil again. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 50 minutes or until rice is tender.\nStir the peas into the rice. Pour the rice mixture into a large serving dish.
