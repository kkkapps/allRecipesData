    "des": "\"If you like spice cake, this is very good. Even if your family doesn't like pumpkin, I promise they'll never know there's pumpkin in this delicious cake. I even used this recipe for cupcakes at Thanksgiving so everyone could get a little more cream cheese frosting.\"",

Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the shortening, eggs, brown sugar and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the pumpkin puree. Beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the chopped pecans. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.",
