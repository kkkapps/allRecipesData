    "des": "\"If you like those restaurants with tapestries on the walls, pillows on the floor and little brass tables, you will enjoy this take on Moroccan lamb pilaf. Boneless lamb meat, celery, bulgur wheat and onion are graced with hints of cinnamon, allspice and chicken broth. Raisins and slivered almonds top off this lovely dish.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Season lamb strips with Greek seasoning and saute in oil until browned. Remove from skillet and set aside.\nReduce heat to medium and heat remaining tablespoon of oil. Saute onion and celery until soft, then add bulgur wheat and continue cooking, stirring often, for an additional 5 minutes.\nStir in reserved lamb, broth, cinnamon and allspice. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, covered, until liquid has been absorbed. Garnish with raisins and almonds and serve.",
