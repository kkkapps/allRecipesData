    "des": "\"Vegan rose meringue cookies made with aquafaba. It is brine from legumes. In this case we will use water from a can of chickpeas. Enjoy! Keep meringues in an airtight container in a cool and dry place. These should keep for a couple of weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nCombine aquafaba, rose water, lemon juice, and cream of tartar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until fluffy, 10 to 30 minutes. Increase speed to high and beat, gradually adding confectioners' sugar, until meringue holds stiff peaks, about 10 minutes. Scoop meringue into a piping bag fitted with a round tip.\nPipe small mounds of meringue onto prepared baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven, rotating sheets halfway through, until meringues are dry and firm, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Turn off oven; keep meringues inside until cooled.",
