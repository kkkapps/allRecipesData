Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nIn a large skillet, cook and stir shrimp and garlic in the butter for about one minute. Pour in half and half; stir.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese in one tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly.  After all Parmesan is added, mix in parsley and salt.  Stir frequently making sure it does not boil.  Sauce will take a while to thicken.\nWhen sauce has thickened, combine with cooked pasta noodles; serve hot.",
