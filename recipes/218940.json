    "ins": "Whisk together the soy sauce, sherry, garlic, brown sugar, and ginger in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken pieces, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking rack with cooking spray, and place on a baking sheet.\nRemove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.\nMix the wheat germ, bread crumbs, sesame seeds, parsley, black pepper, and paprika together in a separate large resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken to the bag and shake to coat the pieces with the bread crumb mixture; transfer the coated chicken pieces to the prepared baking rack.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of of a thigh, not touching bone, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
