    "des": "\"This is one of those recipes where you'll cross your eyes in pleasure after tasting. Great for vegetarian meat substitute or hiding veggies from your kids. They do not taste like squash. If you don't have cotija cheese, you can substitute Parmesan. But cotija marries well with cumin. Serve with refried beans for extra yum.\"",
    "ins": "Heat canola oil in a deep fryer or heavy pot over medium heat.\nMix squash, onion, serrano pepper, flour, egg, cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl.\nDrop squash mixture by the spoonful, working in batches, in the hot oil; fry until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer squash fritters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Fry the corn tortillas in the hot oil until crisp, about 2 minutes per side.\nLayer each tortilla with lettuce, squash fritters, avocado, tomato, and a tablespoon of cotija cheese.",
