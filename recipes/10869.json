Add milk to make 2/3 cup liquid total; mix well.  Divide dough in half.\nOn a floured surface, roll half the dough to an 18 x 12 inch rectangle; fit into and up sides of a 15 x 10 x 1 inch  baking pan.\nSprinkle with corn flake cereal; top with apples.  Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over apples.\nRoll remaining dough to a 16 x 12 inch rectangle; place over apples.  Seal edges; cut slits in the top for steam to escape.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 50 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.",
