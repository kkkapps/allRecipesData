    "des": "\"This recipe makes a great appetizer. I spent a lot of time experimenting with ingredients and finally concluded that this recipe you now see listed turned out to be the best. The grits give a unique texture to the exotic flavors of the Parmesan and Asiago cheeses.\"",
    "ins": "In a small pot combine dry grits, 1 1/2 cups water, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer until grits are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl, then stir in the cooled grits, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Asiago cheese. Stir in the garlic powder, parsley, crushed red pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well.\nSlice the top off of each tomato. Use a spoon to hollow out the tomatoes, leaving the outer shells (approximately 1/4 inch thick) intact.  Fill each with the grits mixture. Arrange stuffed tomatoes on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until light golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.",
