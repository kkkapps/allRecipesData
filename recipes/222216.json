    "des": "\"This is always a big hit at family picnics and parties. There are so many different ingredients you can add or remove to make it your own. It is one of my most requested salads. This dish is best if done the day before. I usually will leave it in the refrigerator overnight.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook spiral pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside.\nMix yellow and red bell peppers, pickles, black olives, ham, and onion in a large salad bowl; stir in spiral pasta. Mix in the mayonnaise until thoroughly coated. Stir in poppy and mustard seeds; season with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate salad until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.",
