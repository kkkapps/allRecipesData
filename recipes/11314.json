Rub in the butter using your hands or a pastry blender to form a crumbly mixture. Press 2 cups of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread the jam to within 1/4 inch of the edge. Sprinkle the remaining crumb mixture over the top, and lightly press it into the jam.\nBake for 35 to 40 minutes in preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool before cutting into bars.",
