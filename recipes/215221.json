    "des": "\"Almost any recipe that calls for salt and pepper will taste even better when seasoned with GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Adobo, instead. Here, we simply shake on our special seasoning--the perfect blend of salt, pepper, garlic, oregano and other Latin spices--to make a great piece of meat taste spectacular.\"",
    "ins": "Season beef with adobo on both sides. Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks to pan and cook until well browned and medium rare, flipping once, about 6 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate; cover with foil to keep warm.\nLower heat to medium. Add garlic to skillet and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add parsley and cook 30 seconds more.\nDivide steaks evenly among serving dishes. Top steaks evenly with garlic mixture.",
