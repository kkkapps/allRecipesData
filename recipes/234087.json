    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpread wheat germ over a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until toasted, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly, then transfer wheat germ to a large bowl.\nStir flour, baking soda, and salt into wheat germ. Beat buttermilk, eggs, and oil in another bowl until smooth; pour egg mixture into flour mixture and stir until batter is just blended.\nHeat griddle over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup portions of batter onto the griddle  and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.",
