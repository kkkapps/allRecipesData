    "ins": "Heat oil in a skillet over medium to high heat and saute meat on all sides until brown, about 10 minutes. Crush garlic with pepper and oregano in a mortar.\nPour wine into skillet with beef. Add crushed garlic mixture, sofrito, salt, beef bouillon cube, and bay leaves; stir to combine and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until meat is tender, about 1 hour. If meat is not tender yet, add 1/2 cup of water and continue to cook until meat can easily be pierced with a fork.\nStir in potatoes, carrots, olives, and tomato paste. Cook on low heat until vegetables are done and sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.",
