    "des": "\"I had this dish years ago at an ex-boyfriend's house while I was there for Thanksgiving dinner and his mom shared her recipe. I am usually pretty traditional and old-fashioned with my Thanksgiving menu, but always make these because they are so good! My relationship didn't last, but this recipe continues to be a favorite, years later!\"",
