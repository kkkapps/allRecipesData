    "des": "\"A great easy cook ahead dish. I like to make these for my boys to eat for breakfast on the go. Good reheated in the microwave. They freeze wonderfully. I often make these with bratwurst sausage and a teaspoon of leftover Knorr\u00c2\u00ae vegetable-spinach dip. Add mushrooms or olives if you like. You can get creative with ingredients.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 36 mini muffin cups with cooking spray.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat and crumble in sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is crumbly and evenly browned, about 10 minutes . Drain and discard any excess grease.\nSprinkle sausage, Cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and green onion evenly into the prepared muffin cups.\nBeat eggs, potato flakes, and cream together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture evenly over the sausage-cheese mixture in the muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until quiches are set in the middle and lightly browned, about 22 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
