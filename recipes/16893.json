    "des": "\"This is a hearty soup with a lot of texture. It is perfect for this time of year when you are snowbound with a roaring fire and some crusty bread. You can really change the taste of the soup depending on what kind of chicken you use. Poached chicken yields a good flavor, whereas roasted chicken offers a more complex taste.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter or margarine in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery and carrots and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until onion is translucent and carrots start to get tender.\nAdd the rice and stir to coat. Then add the chicken stock and the bay leaf. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until rice is tender, stirring occasionally.\nAdd the heavy cream and puree 2 cups of the soup in a blender or food processor. Return this to the pot and add the chicken. Stir well and allow to heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
