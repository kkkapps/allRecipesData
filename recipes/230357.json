    "des": "\"Perfect little shortbread cookies. Dip them in chocolate and top with nuts, coconut, and crushed candy canes. Not too sweet and a great Christmas cookie! Freezes well and dough can be made a day or two ahead. These are good plain, or you can melt some chocolate chips (milk, semi-sweet, or white) and dip one end of the cookie. You can then dip the chocolate end in chopped nuts, crushed candy canes, coconut, jimmies, or decorating sugar. Or, add a little grated orange peel or chopped candied ginger to the chocolate when you melt it for another great flavor. Place on waxed paper to harden.\"",

Mix flour, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract into the creamed butter to form a dough. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Press the dough balls with the bottom of a glass until dough is flattened to 1/2-inch thick.\nBake in the preheated oven until cookies are light brown, 10 to 13 minutes.",
