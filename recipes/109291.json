    "des": "\"A delicious, authentic-tasting Italian risotto with chicken and asparagus. Perfect with a glass of Italian wine!\"",
    "ins": "Bring chicken stock to a boil in a small saucepan, then keep warm over low heat.\nHeat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the cubed chicken, and continue cooking until firm and lightly browned; set aside.\nHeat remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil in the saucepan and cook onions until they soften and turn translucent, about 1 minute. Stir in the rice, and continue cooking until the rice turns opaque, and the onion begins to brown.\nStir in the wine and asparagus; cook, stirring constantly, until the wine evaporates. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in 1/3 of the hot chicken stock. Cook, stirring constantly, until all of the liquid has been absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes.\nStir in another 1/3 of the chicken stock and continue cooking and stirring until absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes.  Season the risotto with oregano and basil. Pour in the remaining stock, and stir until absorbed again, 8 to 10 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stir in the Parmesan cheese and chicken cubes.",
