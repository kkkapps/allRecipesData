    "des": "\"This is a quick bread that mixes up fast and bakes in 15 minutes. It goes great topped with honey or jams.  We like making this especially at Eastertime.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a baking sheet. Whisk the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.\nMix vegetable oil, boiling water, honey, and molasses into the flour mixture, and stir until thoroughly combined. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface, and knead a few times to be sure the dough is completely mixed. Divide the dough into quarters, and roll each quarter into a ball. Press each dough ball into a circle about 1/4-inch thick, and place on prepared baking sheet. If desired, use a kitchen knife to lightly score the breads with 2 criss-cross lines to break the breads apart later.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. If desired, brush the breads with melted butter after removing from oven.",
