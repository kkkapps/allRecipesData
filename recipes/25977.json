    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Mix together the flour and baking soda; set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the yolks one at a time, then stir in the lemon extract.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nIn a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.",
