Arrange in the pan with tips towards the center and lightly press together.\nBake 5 minutes, or until lightly brown.\nRemove from the oven and sprinkle with pieces of Brie cheese. Spoon the cranberry sauce over the cheese. Top with pecans.\nBake an additional 8 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Cool 5 minutes and cut into wedges or squares.",
