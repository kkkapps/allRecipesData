    "des": "\"These chewy, spicy, oatmeal raisin cookies are healthier with more white whole wheat flour and less sugar than the original recipe. We also use all butter and no shortening.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl.\nBeat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding next. Beat in vanilla extract with last egg. Mix in flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in rolled oats and raisins; mixing just enough to evenly combine.  Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until light and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 2 minutes before cooling completely on a wire rack. Store in airtight container.",
