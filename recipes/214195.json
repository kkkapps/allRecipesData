    "ins": "Prepare the salad dressing by whisking together the pineapple juice, orange juice, and 1/4 cup olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. Brush the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. Place the spinach leaves, mango, macadamia nuts, and banana chips into a large mixing bowl.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Heat the shrimp in the skillet on both sides until just warm in the center, about 1 minute per side.\nTo assemble the salads, drizzle the spinach mixture with the salad dressing, and toss until evenly combined. Divide onto four plates. Divide the warm shrimp among the plates, and top with goat cheese. This way the goat cheese will melt down a little from the warmth of the grilled shrimp. Sprinkle with toasted coconut flakes to serve.",
