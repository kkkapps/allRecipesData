    "des": "\"This is my mom's Memaw's Pet\u00c2\u00ae Milk Pudding recipe, only done right if cooked on the stove top. I'll always remember her through her recipes more than her pictures. This recipe is great on cold nights, dressed up with cinnamon. A really great comfort food-I've seen and felt it work! I'm Southern and firmly believe in comfort foods. This pudding is great for holidays, but it is also a really special treat my mom would make on really cold nights, or when she was feeling nostalgic about her grandmother. I hope someone tries it and loves it as much as my family does! We pour a lot of heart into it, too. It always has that extra special feeling to it, because we always make it to share with each other.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk the self-rising flour, sugar, eggs, evaporated milk, and water together in a saucepan placed over medium-high heat. Whisk constantly while bringing the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Whisking constantly, cook the pudding at a simmer until thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhen the pudding has thickened, stir in the margarine and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined.\nRemove pudding from heat and set aside for about 10 minutes to cool. Sprinkle pudding with cinnamon, and serve warm.",
