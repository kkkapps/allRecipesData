    "des": "\"A little trip to Ireland all baked in a delicious chocolate cake with Guinness\u00c2\u00ae flavor. You can serve it with powdered sugar or ganache poured on top. I use this recipe for my groom's cakes but I frost it with a chocolate buttercream then pour ganache evenly over the top. I use raspberries or strawberries to decorate the top for color. It turns out beautiful!\"",
