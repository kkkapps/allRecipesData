    "des": "\"Peaches and nectarines are so in season right now - any farmer's market will be guaranteed have at least 3 or 4 vendors selling 'em. This recipe uses up those stone fruits in a way that elevates them without being too fussy. It's pretty enough to be a treat for house guests, but still easy enough to make for an indulgent breakfast.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan.\nBoil peaches and nectarines 1 fruit at a time in a pot until very soft, about 30 seconds each. Let cool until ready to handle. Peel, core, and chop into bite-sized pieces.\nMix the fruit, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Pour into the prepared pan.\nCombine flour, brown sugar, coconut oil, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix with hands or a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over the fruit mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until top is browned and juice appears bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.",
