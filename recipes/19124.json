Cover dish or bowl and refrigerate for about 1 hour.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside.\nHeat butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, and saute for about 10 minutes, or until soft; set aside.\nPreheat oven to Broil.\nRemove chicken from marinade (discard any remaining liquid), and broil for about 5 minutes each side. When chicken is almost finished, top each breast with 2 slices bacon, then cheese. Continue to broil until cheese has melted, then remove from oven. Serve with mushrooms and salad dressing for topping.",
