    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCoat the ribs heavily with salt. This brings out the fat.\nGrill for 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. Remove cooked ribs to a large glass serving dish, and squeeze lime juice over them. Serve immediately.",
