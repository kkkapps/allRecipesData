    "des": "\"Spicy, sweet and smoky, this side dish is perfect alongside grilled pork tenderloin. It's also a great change to your Thanksgiving dinner. Again, it's SPICY! This can be made ahead and stored in 200 degree oven until the rest of the meal is ready. For those of you who like less spicy, remove the seeds of the chipotle or cut down to one pepper and one tablespoon of adobo sauce. You can always add more later.\"",
    "ins": "Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.\nPlace the potatoes into a bowl and add the butter, chipotle chiles, adobo sauce, and half-and-half. Mash well with a potato masher, and season to taste with salt to serve.",
