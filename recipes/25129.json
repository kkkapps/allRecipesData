    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. The mixture should be thick and light yellow. Gradually stir in the sifted ingredients until well blended. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls, three inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Sprinkle grated chocolate over the tops of the cookies.\nBake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cookies begin to brown around the edges. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks. Store in an airtight cookie jar.",
