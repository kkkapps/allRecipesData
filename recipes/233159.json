    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan. Cook the rotini in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse with cold water until cooled completely; drain. Transfer pasta to a large mixing bowl.\nWhisk olive oil, vinegar, and honey together in a bowl; drizzle over pasta and toss to coat. Fold tomatoes, sweet onion, cucumber, carrots, celery, garlic, green onions, parsley, and cilantro individually into the pasta mixture to assure even distribution. Season with black pepper.",
