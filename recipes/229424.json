    "des": "\"My mom always makes her pumpkin roll around Thanksgiving and takes one to work where everyone asks her if she can make them one and they all want the recipe. You may want to halve the recipe unless you are making for a crowd or to give away. It makes a lot. It is without a doubt the best pumpkin roll I've ever had!\"",

Generously dust a kitchen towel with confectioners' sugar.\nBeat eggs, white sugar, and pumpkin together in a bowl until creamy.\nSift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg mixture. Stir to combine. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for exactly 10 minutes.\nImmediately turn cake onto the prepared kitchen towel.
