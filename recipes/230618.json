    "des": "\"This recipe won the Blum invitational chili cook-off/Super Bowl\u00c2\u00ae party. It really is good. Many people say this but this one guarantees an empty pot when taken to potlucks. I got this recipe from my friend Mark, who has spent his life in public safety positions. He hasn't forgotten his firehouse roots as evidenced by this recipe.\"",
