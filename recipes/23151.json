Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and dice.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and crumble.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the potatoes, eggs, bacon, olives, 1/4 cup green onions, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt and pepper. Increase quantities of mayonnaise and sour cream as necessary to create desired consistency. Garnish with remaining green onions.",
