    "des": "\"An old fashioned plum pudding that was passed down to me from my grandmother, with a modification of using baking mix instead of making the top from scratch.   I serve it with ice cream or what I call a Dip made from milk and flavored to taste with cinnamon and vanilla.  I let each individual pour on the amount of dip they would like from a small pitcher.\"",
