I like to use Crispix\u00c2\u00ae for the shape, but you can use rice or corn Chex\u00c2\u00ae. Store this in a sealed zipper bag or plastic container.\"",
    "ins": "Combine vanilla almond bark and shortening in a microwave-safe bowl. Melt in microwave stirring every 30 seconds until mixture is smooth, about 90 seconds total.\nPlace corn and rice cereal in a large bowl. Slowly pour the almond bark mixture over the cereal, stirring often to completely coat. Add cake mix and confectioners' sugar to cereal mixture; toss to coat. Shake sprinkles over the puppy chow.",
