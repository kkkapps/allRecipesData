    "des": "\"While this recipe for grilled sea bass with an Asian chile-lime dressing is super-fast and easy, it doesn't taste or look super-fast and easy. Your guests will be impressed, and it will be our little secret. I served mine with some caramelized parsnips.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nWhisk garlic, lime zest, rice vinegar, fish sauce, lime juice, chile pepper sauce, and sesame oil in a glass bowl.\nBrush both sides of sea bass fillets with vegetable oil and sprinkle lightly with salt.\nCook on the preheated grill until fish is opaque, shows good grill marks, and springs back when pressed lightly, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer fillets to a serving platter.\nWhisk dressing again; taste and and adjust seasoning. Drizzle dressing over warm fish. Sprinkle fillets with cilantro leaves.",
