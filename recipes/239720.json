    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpoon garlic powder into beer in the can. Prop the chicken, butt-side down, onto the beer can so the can goes into the cavity. Place the chicken, with the can as a stand, into a large oven-proof skillet.\nMelt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; add garlic and cook until butter starts bubbling, about 2 minutes. Remove garlic and discard.\nInject chicken with the garlic-infused butter using a baster or injector until all areas are injected.\nMix brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, and salt in a small bowl. Coat chicken with brown sugar mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
