Best served with guacamole salad over beef flautas with lettuce and tomato chopped, and topped with sour cream. Corn tortillas may be substituted for flour if desired.\"",

Reduce heat to low, and cover.  Cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nStir in the diced tomatoes, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cover. Cook for 45 minutes, or until the meat is the desired tenderness.",
