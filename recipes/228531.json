    "des": "\"This recipe comes from a dear friend of mine who's made his living as a sous chef on a luxury cruise line. When I asked him for a recipe for deep fried turkey, this is what he produced. Please remember to PAT THE TURKEY DRY before placing into hot oil. We don't want any injuries....just full tummies! Recipe is for brine for a 16-pound turkey.\"",
    "ins": "Combine vegetable broth, kosher salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and ginger in a large stockpot over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Bring to a boil, remove brine from heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate brine until chilled, at least 4 hours. Add ice water, apple, onion, cinnamon stick, 1 cup water, rosemary, and sage leaves to brine just before using.",
