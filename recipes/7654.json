    "ins": "In a bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until stiff.  Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar.\nIn another bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.\nIn a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.  Beat in lemon rind, lemon juice, sour cream, and vanilla.  Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture, along with about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites.  Fold in the rest of the egg whites gently but thoroughly.  Stir in the almonds.  Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 70 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick.  Cool on a wire rack.",
