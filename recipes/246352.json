Cook over medium-low heat until the beans are warmed through and the coconut oil is melted, about 5 minutes. Mix in eggs, maple syrup, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, salt, and baking powder.\nTransfer black bean mixture to a blender. Cover and blend into a smooth batter, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour into greased pan and sprinkle chocolate chips on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until batter pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool before cutting, about 30 minutes.",
