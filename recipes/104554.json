    "des": "\"This is a homemade recipe from my dad.  Whenever I make these for someone, they fall in love with it and always request I make more.  It fills your home with a wonderful smell and is the best way to have cheap chops go so tender they fall right off the bone. Serve with hot sauce and mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSeason the pork chops with seasoned salt and place in a glass baking dish. Arrange onion slices on top of pork chops, then pour the water into the pan. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, then reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about another 30 minutes.",
