    "ins": "Whisk the soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar together in a bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved; pour into a large skillet and place over medium heat. Cook the chicken livers in the sauce until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Slice the livers into bite-sized pieces.\nPreheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nPlace one piece of liver, a water chestnut, and a pineapple chunk on a piece of bacon and secure the bacon wrap with a toothpick by inserting through all the ingredients. Place on a baking tray, and repeat until all the ingredients have been wrapped.\nBake in the preheated oven on the second rack until the bacon is crispy, about 5 minutes. Serve hot.",
