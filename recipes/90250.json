    "ins": "Place the potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender enough to insert a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool slightly, then peel and slice.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a layer of  potato slices in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with a layer of onion slices, and then some of the sliced eggs. Cover with a thin layer of sour cream. Repeat layering, until ingredients are used up, ending with sour cream on top. Season with salt and pepper.\nBake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top layer of sour cream is golden brown.",
