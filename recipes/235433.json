    "ins": "Process tomatoes, onion, 3 tablespoons and 1/2 teaspoon chopped celery, carrot, beet, green bell pepper, and garlic through a juicer.\nStir vegetable juices, water, 1 1/4 teaspoons white sugar, lemon juice, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large pot. Bring to a boil and cook until flavors blend, about 20 minutes.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Ladle juice into a quart jar. Stir 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1 teaspoon salt into the juice. Wipe the rim of the jar with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lid and screw on ring.\nProcess juice in a pressure canner at 10 pounds of pressure for 35 minutes.\nRemove the jar from the pressure canner and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface until cool. Once cool, press the top of the lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.",
