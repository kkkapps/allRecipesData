    "des": "\"My friend Keni's love of smokey chipotle peppers inspired this recipe. It comes together perfectly and is a unique chili that will stand out against others. It is a spicy chili that at the same time is mellow. It gives you the kick without the lingering burn like many chilis do.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and sausage in the hot skillet until some of the fat renders, 2 to 3 minutes; add onion and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the meats are browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker.\nStir kidney beans, chili beans, diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, celery, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, chipotle chiles, bacon bits, chili sauce, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, brown sugar, cumin, and salt with the beef mixture.\nCook on Low until vegetables are completely tender but the celery retains a slight bit of firmness, 6 to 8 hours (or 3 to 4 hours on High).",
