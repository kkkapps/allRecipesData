    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a roasting pan (large enough to accommodate 8 pepper halves in a single layer) with cooking spray.\nCombine the ground sirloin, Italian sausage, brown rice, Italian seasonings, salt, pepper, garlic, Parmesan cheese, egg, and 1/2 cup Classico(R) Tomato & Basil sauce in a large bowl. Mix until combined.\nDivide meat mixture evenly among the green pepper halves; press to compress slightly. Arrange halves in prepared pan. Spoon the remaining Classico(R) Tomato & Basil sauce onto the tops of the meat and peppers.  Cover tightly with foil.\nBake until the peppers are soft and internal temperature of the meat reaches 165 degrees F, about 1 1/2 hours.\nRemove from oven. Remove foil and top each pepper with shredded cheese.\nTurn oven to broil. Place peppers, uncovered under the broiler. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.",
