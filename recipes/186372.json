    "ins": "Place the shredded cheese and garlic in the bowl of a food processor.  With food processor running, slowly pour in the beer, scraping sides of the bowl as necessary; process until evenly blended.  Season with cayenne pepper to taste.  Transfer to a serving bowl, cover, and chill until ready to serve.",
