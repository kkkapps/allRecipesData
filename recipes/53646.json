    "ins": "Adjust oven rack to upper position, and set oven to broil.  You may also use a toaster oven to cook the sandwiches if you don't want to broil them in the oven.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels.\nPlace a few spears of asparagus on a slice of bread.  Top with 2 slices crisp bacon then a slice of cheese.\nToast under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly.",
