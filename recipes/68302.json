    "ins": "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the green beans with liquid and wine. Cook until heated through; drain.\nPlace the cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on low or medium power in 1 minute intervals, until melted.\nScoop the melted cheese over the heated green beans, and season with minced garlic to serve.",
