    "des": "\"I love to eat ham and sweet potatoes all year round.  I came up with this easy ham and sweet potato dish that also makes clean up a breeze.  Serve with a vegetable and/or side salad and rolls and you will have a complete, satisfying meal.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nTear off two large sheets of aluminum foil. Place one ham slice onto each piece of foil, and sprinkle brown sugar on both sides. Spread a little bit of the crushed pineapple over the ham, then top with sweet potatoes. Sprinkle a little bit more brown sugar and pineapple over the sweet potatoes. Close the aluminum foil tightly around the ham, and place on a baking sheet.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven, and carefully open the packets. Sprinkle miniature marshmallows over the top, and return to the oven with the foil open. Bake for another 10 minutes. If you want the marshmallows really toasty, you could brown them under the broiler for a couple of minutes. You will end up with a sweet, juicy ham dish and very few dishes to wash.",
