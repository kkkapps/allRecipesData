    "des": "\"Easier to roll out than normal pie crust, but still with a flaky crust. It is VERY important that the ingredients be cold. This is what helps produce a flaky crust. This recipe is for an unsweetened pie crust. Just add sugar if you would like a sweetened crust.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk flour and salt together in a mixing bowl.\nCut the cold butter and then the shortening into the flour mixture with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nSprinkle vodka and water over the top of the mixture. Fold together ingredients until mixture sticks together to form a tacky dough. Divide dough into 2 halves; flatten each half into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour to 2 days.\nWhen you are ready to make your pie, remove dough from refrigerator, roll each piece out for your pie from the middle to the edge. Bake according to your pie directions.",
