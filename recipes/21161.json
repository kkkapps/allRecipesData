    "ins": "To make dough:  In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder and salt.  Cut in shortening with a pastry blender or two knives, until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in milk, a little at a time, and mix well.  Knead briefly.  Set aside.\nFor filling:  In a medium bowl, stir together cherries, sugar, cinnamon and lemon zest until well mixed.\nOn a floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle 1/4 inch thick.  Brush with melted butter.  Spread the cherry filling evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges.  Roll up the dough, starting at a short end, and pinch together all the edges so that the juice will not escape.  Wrap roll  in a kitchen towel or cheesecloth and tie loosely.\nPlace in a steamer or colander over boiling water, cover and steam for 90 minutes, until dough is firm.  Remove cloth, slice and serve.",
