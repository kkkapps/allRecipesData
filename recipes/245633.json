    "des": "\"Whether you use tilapia or any other mild white fish, this easy, throw-it-on-the-grill recipe is big in flavor, not in fat and calories. Serve both fish and asparagus with a squirt of lemon and tartar or cocktail sauce if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nSnap asparagus spears to remove tough ends. Place asparagus on a plate and drizzle olive oil over asparagus; season with salt and pepper.\nMix bread crumbs, seafood seasoning, and garlic powder together in a shallow dish. Whisk eggs together in a separate shallow dish. Dip each fillet in egg, then dredge in breadcrumb mixture.\nCook fillets on grill until golden brown, about 10 minutes per side.\nCook asparagus on opposite side of grill, turning occasionally, until browned and tender when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes.",
