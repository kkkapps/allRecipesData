    "des": "\"Sweet and spicy, snapper holds up really well to this cooking, but feel free to use a fish of your liking. Also you can just use fillets instead of whole fish, but for wow factor whole fish is the way. Serve with rice.\"",
    "ins": "Cut heads off each snapper and score skin on each side; sprinkle with sea salt.\nHeat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add snapper and pan-fry until skin is brown and crispy and flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Place snapper on a serving platter and return skillet to stove top.\nCook remaining oil, tomatoes, chiles, and garlic over high heat in a skillet until tomatoes soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water, fish sauce, and palm sugar; simmer until mixture is reduced slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in green onions, cilantro, and cornstarch; simmer until mixture is reduced to a sticky-sauce consistency, about 1 minute more. Pour sauce over fish to serve.",
