    "des": "\"You won't need ketchup or mustard! This savory blend of spices will be enough for any person. This may even make you forget you're eating ground beef. Serve with a light gravy, garlic mashed potato and veg of your choice. I like Italian green beans.\"",
    "ins": "Place ground beef into a large bowl and break into smaller pieces. Cover with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, mustard, paprika, and dill weed; knead thoroughly. Knead in onion, egg, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix in crackers until thoroughly incorporated.\nShape beef mixture into 5-ounce, 1/2-inch thick patties.\nPreheat a grill pan over medium heat. Grill patties until an instant-read thermometer into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes per side.",
