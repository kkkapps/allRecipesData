    "des": "\"I have been making fried green tomatoes for over 35 years, taught by my grandmother who is from down south. Over the years I have tried and made fried green tomato recipes and this is the one that is perfect. Cajun ranch sauce goes perfect with this crispy on the outside but smooth and creamy on the inside tomato.\"",
    "ins": "Season tomato slices with salt and pepper.\nCombine flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in a shallow bowl. Pour buttermilk in a second shallow bowl. Mix cornmeal, parsley, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and cayenne pepper in a third shallow bowl.\nDredge each tomato slice in the flour mixture to coat, dip into the buttermilk, and finish by pressing each side of the tomato into the cornmeal mixture to coat. Lay coated tomato slices onto a baking sheet; rest to let tomatoes absorb flavor of coating, 10 to 15 minutes.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGently drop tomato slices into the hot oil and cook until golden brown and floating, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with paper towel.\nWhisk ranch dressing, cajun seasoning, and hot pepper sauce together in a small bowl; serve with the fried tomato slices.",
