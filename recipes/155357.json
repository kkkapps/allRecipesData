    "des": "\"This is a delicious vegan version of pumpkin soup with just enough spice for a mild kick. It's made with coconut oil instead of butter and uses light coconut milk in place of milk or cream. It makes a great starter, or is a perfect small meal on its own as it is quite filling.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the coconut oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the vegetable broth, curry powder, salt, coriander, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until the mixture comes to a gentle boil, about 10 minutes. Cover, and boil 15 to 20 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Whisk in the pumpkin and coconut milk, and cook another 5 minutes.\nPour the soup into a blender, filling only half way and working in batches if necessary; process until smooth. Return to a pot, and reheat briefly over medium heat before serving.",
