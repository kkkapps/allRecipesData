    "des": "\"My mother, Elaine, made these for us regularly for us in the 60's for after school treats.   They are about 20 minutes from start to finish!   The fun thing with this recipe you can add coconut, nuts, or butterscotch chips.\"",
    "ins": "In mixing bowl: measure 2 cups brown sugar,  vegetable oil, and eggs.  Cream on medium for 3 minutes.  Add vanilla.  Slowly add white flour and baking powder and salt. Add baking soda mixed in hot water separately.\nAdd  chocolate chips, and walnuts if desired.   (Or substitute  coconut, nuts, or butterscotch chips.)\nPour batter into a 14 x 17 inch pan.   Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) until just golden.  Take out of oven just before you think they are done.  They cool in the pan.  Cut and serve.  Try nutmeg and lemon flavoring for variety, reduce lemon to 1 teaspoon.",
