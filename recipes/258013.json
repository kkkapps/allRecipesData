I make this often when entertaining guests and it always goes fast. You can make any sort of topping variations. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it. I cook this also with my family. Each person gets their own tortilla to, as my kids say, decorate.\"",

Brush with olive oil; sprinkle garlic powder, salt, and pepper on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove tortilla from the oven and spread tomato sauce on top.
