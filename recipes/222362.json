    "des": "\"In 2011 I attended the 'Chefs of the Coast' cook-off where 4 chefs battled it out cooking their own personal recipe using Four Roses Bourbon\u00c2\u00ae. I thought that I could absolutely make a burger worthy of the Four Roses name and this is it. It's a savory burger that is seasoned to perfection and topped with bacon and other assorted toppings.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nMix ground beef, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, steak seasoning, and garlic salt in a bowl; divide and shape into 2 patties.\nCook on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes; turn, top each burger with bacon and Cheddar cheese, and continue cooking until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes more for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on split buns topped with tomato and lettuce.",
