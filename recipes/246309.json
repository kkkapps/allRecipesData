    "des": "\"A grilled flat bread with char finishes that serves as a substantial vessel for any dip on race day.  Fire up the grill, pick up a few lemons, limes, jalapenos and chiles then head to your garden for fresh herbs to create a winning combination of flavors.\"",
    "ins": "In an electric mixer with a dough hook, add flour, olive oil, kosher salt, and black pepper. Turn on mixer to medium speed.\nStir yeast into warm water. Pour into flour mixture and mix until dough looks smooth.\nRemove dough from mixer and place on floured surface. Gently knead for 1 minute.\nAdd finely chopped fresh herbs or chiles, if desired.\nCut dough into four equal parts. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nUnwrap dough and place on well-floured surface. Dust dough with flour and flatten dough with hands.\nLet dough rest for about 10 minutes then stretch (as if it were pizza dough) pulling the dough out.\nShape into rectangles then brush with olive oil; season with salt and pepper.\nOn a medium hot grill, cook bread for 3 to 4 minutes per side. For citrus flavor, squeeze freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice over dough while it's grilling.\nServe immediately.",
