    "des": "\"A simple blend of spices combines to make a wonderful rub for steak.  Can be used on any steak but it's best on flat iron or flank steak.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the paprika, salt, sugar, chili powder, chipotle powder, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a small bowl until blended. Rub the seasoning mix all over the flat iron steaks, then wrap them tightly with plastic wrap. Marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 8 hours (the longer the better).\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nCook the steaks on the preheated grill until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium. Allow the steaks to rest for 5 minutes in a warm location before slicing.",
