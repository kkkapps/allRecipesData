    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLay a pork chop flat on your work surface. Use the tip of a sharp boning or paring knife to create a pocket by making a slit in the side; repeat with remaining pork chops.\nMelt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; add bacon bits, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, onion, 1/2 teaspoon mustard, and 1/2 clove garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Allow stuffing to cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Stuff into pork chops and secure with 2 crossed toothpicks.\nHeat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown pork chops, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking dish, reserving drippings in skillet. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nHeat reserved drippings in the skillet over medium heat. Add 1 clove garlic, balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, and 1 teaspoon mustard; simmer until reduced, about 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream. Coat pork chops with sauce.",
