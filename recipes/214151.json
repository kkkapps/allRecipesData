Spread 1 cup of Cheddar cheese over the nachos, top the chips with another teaspoon or so of salsa, and top with the remaining 1 cup of cheese.\nBake the nachos in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbling, about 5 minutes. Serve hot with sour cream, guacamole, and any remaining salsa on the side for dipping the chips.",
