    "des": "\"These are sauteed pork chops smothered in a tomato sauce with fresh onion and bell pepper. It's a fairly quick and simple recipe. Try serving with rice.\"",
    "ins": "Heat enough oil to just cover the bottom of a large skillet over medium high heat. Dredge the pork chops in flour, add to pan and brown well on both sides. Remove chops and set aside.\nAdd the onion and bell pepper and cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until almost tender. Return pork chops to skillet and pour in the tomato sauce. Allow the sauce to start bubbling and then reduce heat to low.\nSimmer for 30 minutes and season with garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.",
