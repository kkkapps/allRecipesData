    "des": "\"This is pure comfort food. There is nothing nicer than to cuddle up with my girlfriend in front of a warm fire and a movie while munching on thick slices of this bread hot from the oven dripping with melted country butter and warm honey with a big mug of milky tea.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nMix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, rosemary, and salt together in a large bowl. Add buttermilk and honey; mix until a soft dough forms.\nTurn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Shape into a round loaf approximately 8 inches in diameter. Score top of the dough with 2 shallow crosses, marking 8 wedges. Transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Tap the bottom of the loaf; it will sound hollow when done.\nLet bread rest for 10 minutes before slicing.",
