    "des": "\"Sesame whispers sweet-nothings in your ear with this light and tangy adaptation. This recipe avoids vegetable oil while incorporating the complete egg to deliver a healthy-choice alternative spread. Fresh mayo should be used within 2 weeks or less. \n\nAlways serve chilled. Put on sandwiches, in a light crab salad, or use in deviled eggs with a spice injection. Use a pasteurized egg, if possible.\"",
    "ins": "Blend egg, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, and salt in a blender for 15 seconds. Remove the cover and slowly pour sesame oil into blender in a steady stream until mixture emulsifies and mayonnaise forms.",
