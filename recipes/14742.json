    "des": "\"A honey mustard lime sauce coats these baked ribs. Scrumptious! When determining the number of servings, take into account the fact that most people actually like to have a rack of ribs to themselves. Accordingly, 4 pounds of spareribs might serve 4 or 6 people, depending on the serving size!\"",
    "ins": "Cut ribs into serving size pieces and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nIn a medium saucepan saute onion, garlic and mushrooms in oil until tender. Add vinegar, honey, lime juice, mustard, salt, pepper, soy sauce, water and chili sauce and mix together well. Warm mixture throughout.\nPour this sauce over the ribs and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until ribs are tender and internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Baste often with sauce.",
