Allow machine to complete selected cycle.\nTo bake conventionally, remove the dough from the bread machine pan after the Dough cycle has completed.  Shape into a loaf, and place in a greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.  Let rise until doubled.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 40 minutes.",
