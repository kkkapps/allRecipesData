    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the tempeh slices and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until they start to brown.  Pour in half of the liquid aminos and cook for 1 minute.  Flip the tempeh slices and cook until toasted, 3 to 4 more minutes. Pour in the remaining liquid aminos and cook for 1 minute.  Remove the tempeh, and set it aside.\nIn the same skillet, heat the remaining oil over medium heat.  Cook the onion, green pepper, and jalapeno until the vegetables have softened, 4 to 5 minutes.\nSpread each pita half with 1 teaspoon soy mayonnaise.  Stuff each pita with several slices of tempeh, peppers and onions, and a piece of Swiss cheese.  Toast the sandwiches in a toaster oven for 2 minutes or until the cheese has melted.",
