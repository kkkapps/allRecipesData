    "ins": "Put 6 cups watermelon, 1/2 of the cucumber, jalapeno pepper, and vinegar in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour gazpacho into a large bowl and stir remaining watermelon and cucumber into soup. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.\nDivide gazpacho among 4 bowls and top each with blueberries.",
