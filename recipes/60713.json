    "des": "\"This recipe was inspired by a dip I tasted in Tucson, AZ.  It has a spicy flair and tastes great with salty chips and crunchy bell peppers.  Be sure to use chipotle (don't use other types of dried chile pepper) for that authentic Southwest flavor.  Perfect for Cinco de Mayo!\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the sour cream, mayonnaise, chipotle powder, garlic powder, salt, and lime juice in a non-reactive (glass) bowl. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight. Stir in additional chipotle powder to taste before serving if desired.",
