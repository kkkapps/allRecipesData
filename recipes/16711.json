    "des": "\"Baked tilapia, marinated in garlic and olive oil.  If you prefer to grill, get your grill hot and put the fish on aluminum foil; grill until desired doneness is reached. \"",
    "ins": "Rub the fish fillets with the crushed garlic, then place them in a shallow, non-reactive dish. Spoon the olive oil over the fish until they are coated.  Place the onion on top of the fish. Cover the fish and refrigerate overnight to allow the fish to soak in the marinade.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIf baking the fish, transfer it to a 9x13 inch baking dish along with the olive oil, garlic, and onion. Sprinkle the fish with the cayenne or white pepper. If you are grilling the fish, wrap the fish and oil, garlic, onion, and pepper in aluminum foil.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees F) for 30 minutes.",
