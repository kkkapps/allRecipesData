    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, mix milk and cream.  Warm until foam forms around the edges.  Remove from heat.\nIn a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until frothy.  Gradually pour the warm milk into the egg yolks, whisking constantly.  Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.\nPour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.\nPour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm. If the gelato is too firm, place it in the refrigerator until it reaches the desired consistency.",
