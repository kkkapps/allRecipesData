    "ins": "Move a rack to the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir gingersnap crumbs with light brown sugar and melted butter in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish.\nBake the crust on the center rack of the preheated oven just until set, 3 to 4 minutes. Baking too long will make the crust hard to cut. Remove the crust and let cool.\nStir cornstarch and water in a saucepan until smoothly mixed; add sugar and 1 1/2 cups blueberries. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the blueberry sauce is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups blueberries and lemon juice.\nPour filling into the gingersnap crust and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 1 hour.",
