    "des": "\"Inspired by a snapper Veracruz dish I had at a local Mexican restaurant, i created this variation using chicken. Saut\u00c3\u00a9ed chicken breasts are topped with tomato-basil sauce, tomatoes, saut\u00c3\u00a9ed onions, red and green bell peppers, and garnished with green olives and capers. Serve over hot rice or quinoa.\"",
    "ins": "Salt and pepper the chicken breasts on both sides.\nHeat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken in oil and cook until chicken begins to turn white, about 3 or 4 minutes.  Turn and cook until chicken is browned, 3 or 4 more minutes, and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove chicken from skillet.\nAdd remaining oil to pan. Stir in onions and red and green bell peppers. Cook and stir until the onions are softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes.\nStir in the tomato-basil sauce; let simmer for about 5 minutes until slightly thickened. Return the chicken to the pan and cook until chicken is heated through, a few minutes more.\nServe over hot rice or quinoa. Garnish with chopped cherry tomatoes, green olives, and capers.",
