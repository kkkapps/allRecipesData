    "des": "\"This is a kid-friendly spin on the old-fashioned meatloaf mom used to make. The addition of pepperoni adds flavor and excitement. I use extra lean beef to account for the added fat of the pepperoni. If desired, top with tomato sauce or pizza sauce and extra Parmesan.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine chopped pepperoni, ground beef, tomato sauce, cracker crumbs, Parmesan cheese, eggs, minced onion, French-fried onions, garlic powder, oregano, and tarragon in a large bowl; form into a loaf in a loaf pan.\nBake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place a layer of sliced pepperoni on the top of meatloaf and bake for 5 minutes more.",
