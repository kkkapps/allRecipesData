    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace pork roast in the center of a roasting pan; arrange pearl onions around the roast. Pour in water, olive oil, and lime juice. Evenly coat roast with black pepper, cayenne pepper, tarragon, and garlic powder. Spread blue cheese dressing over entire roast.\nBake in the preheated oven until roast is no longer pink in the center, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nTransfer roast to a deep-sided serving dish; arrange onions around roast. Scoop enough cooking liquid to coat the bottom of the serving dish. Place the remaining liquid in a gravy boat.",
