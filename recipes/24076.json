    "ins": "In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion until all pink is gone; drain.\nStir in tomato sauce, water, salt, parsley, basil and pepper; mix well.  Heat until sauce boils. Break spaghetti in half and drop into sauce a little at a time. Cover and turn to low.\nCook until spaghetti is tender, approximately 20 to 25 minutes.  Stir occasionally to keep from sticking to pan and from noodles sticking together. Add water, 1/2 to 1 cup, if it starts to dry out and noodles are not cooked.",
