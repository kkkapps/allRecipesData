    "des": "\"This tasty flatbread- flavored with sun-dried tomato pesto -is about as far from a traditional recipe as you can get.  One evening I had the urge to bake something, so I improvised with the ingredients at hand.  My family and I have been hooked ever since.  As well as tasting great, this recipe is incredibly quick and easy, because it's heated on a stovetop, rather than in the oven.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt. Mix in the sun-dried tomato pest until evenly distributed. Add water 1 teaspoon at a time so that the mixture is just moist enough to form a ball.\nHeat a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Form the dough into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, flatten the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness, or about as thick as a very thin pizza crust. Place the flat dough into the preheated pan, and fry for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. When done, each side should have several browned spots. Serve immediately, or store at room temperature. It keeps very well.",
