    "des": "\"A new twist on ordinary fried mozzarella sticks.  A combination of bread and mozzarella makes for a satisfying meal or appetizer. Be sure your mozzarella slice is large enough to cover the bread! Serve with hot tomato sauce or as a hot sandwich covered with tomato sauce.  You'll never eat a regular mozzarella stick again.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSandwich the mozzarella cheese between Italian bread slices.\nIn a small bowl, mix the Parmesan cheese into the eggs.\nPlace the bread crumbs in a small bowl.\nDip both sides of the sandwich into the egg mixture, then into the bread crumbs, coating thoroughly.\nCarefully place the coated sandwich into deep fryer. Cook 2 to 4 minutes, or until bread is golden brown and cheese has melted. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels and cut into 4 triangles to serve.",
