Skim the butter and flour and other impurities that rise to the top and continue to simmer until the veloute is reduced to 2/3 its original quantity and the sauce is the consistency of heavy cream.\nStrain through fine sieve.\nReturn veloute to sauce pan over low heat and add brie cheese, cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the cheese has melted. Add wine and vegetables and simmer lightly until the vegetables are al dente. Heat heavy cream over low heat and add to soup. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper.
