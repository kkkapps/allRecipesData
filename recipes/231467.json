    "des": "\"Hazelnut in puff pastry; it doesn't get any better than that. Very simple.\"",
    "ins": "Lay puff pastry flat onto a work surface. Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread over puff pastry and sprinkle with hazelnuts.\nStarting with a long edge of the pastry, roll pastry tightly around filling, stopping in the middle. Repeat with the opposite long edge, meeting the first roll. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nCut pastry into 3/4-inch slices. Arrange slices on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until golden, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip cookies and continue baking until crisp, 4 to 5 minutes more.",
