    "ins": "Combine tuna, egg, bread crumbs, onion, celery, red bell pepper, mayonnaise, hot chili sauce, chili sauce, dill, salt, pepper, hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well. Shape into 4 patties (mixture will be very soft and delicate). Refrigerate for 30 minutes to make the patties easier to handle, if desired.\nCoat a non-stick skillet with cooking spray; fry tuna patties for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through.  These are fragile, so be careful when turning them.\nServe on buns with tomato slices and lettuce leaves, if desired.",
