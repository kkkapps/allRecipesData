    "des": "\"This alternative to pumpkin bread will spice up your fall menu. It was created when I was given a Turkish turban squash by a friend who didn't know what to do with it. This recipe can also be made with canned pumpkin, any soft squash, or mashed sweet potatoes, if you prefer, for a delicious, wholesome bread every time.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace turban squash halves cut-side in a baking dish. Pour a small amount of water into the bottom of the dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until very soft, about 1 hour. Pour out any moisture that accumulated in the cavity of the squash. Let cool until easily handled, 10 to 15 minutes.\nScoop squash flesh into a large bowl. Mash until smooth. Transfer to gallon-sized freezer bags and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.\nCombine 4 cups mashed squash, eggs, white sugar, dark brown sugar, applesauce, oil, vanilla extract, and ginger in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended, about 3 minutes.\nWhisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir into the squash mixture with a wooden spoon until just blended. Fold dried cranberries into the batter.\nDivide batter between the prepared loaf pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.",
