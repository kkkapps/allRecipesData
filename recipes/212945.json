Add the ham and bay leaves; season with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Again cover the skillet and cook another 2 minutes.\nPour the coconut milk into the skillet. Add the rice and stir. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.",
