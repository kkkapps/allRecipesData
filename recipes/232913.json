    "des": "\"I never liked how peanut butter cookies turned out. They were always too greasy-feeling or too hard and never were soft a few days later. After a lot of trial and error batches, now I get rave reviews from these cookies. They are very rich and soft for those who do not like the typical crunchy style of peanut butter cookies. They do take a bit of time to prepare and cook but very much worth the wait. I used reduced-fat peanut butter in both crunchy and creamy to make for a rich-tasting cookie with more peanut flavor and a less greasy feeling on your hand.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.\nBeat butter, creamy peanut butter, and crunchy peanut butter together in a large bowl until smooth. Beat egg white and white sugar into butter mixture until smooth. Add whole egg and brown sugar; continue to beat until smooth. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until batter is well mixed.\nRoll the dough into 1 1/4-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Press balls with a fork creating a crosshatch. Freeze cookie dough on baking sheet until dough is firm, 5 to 8 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven until cookies puff up, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
