    "des": "\"This is a favorite among my teenage athletes for a before-practice snack. I fill baggies with these and throw them in the freezer. The kids grab a baggie on the way to school and the mini muffins are thawed out and ready to eat before the end of the day.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease mini muffin cups.\nCombine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, chocolate chips, protein powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda in a large bowl.\nWhisk milk, peanut butter, eggs, oil, and yogurt in another bowl until smooth. Pour over flour mixture and stir until batter is just blended. Fill muffin cups 3/4 of the way full.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Cool in the muffin pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack until completely cooled, about 20 minutes.",
