    "des": "\"This is an old Victorian recipe intended to use up all the uneaten canned fruit in the pantry. It's lovely around Christmas time, and always great for holiday gifts. If desired, frost with cream cheese frosting or a lemon glaze.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 8x4 inch loaf pan.\nSift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and cloves together in a large bowl. Stir in the oats. Beat the butter, sugar, and vanilla together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs until well blended. Mix in the applesauce, walnuts, and raisins. Stir in the flour mixture just until moistened. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.\nBake in preheated oven until a knife inserted in middle comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Take care not to overbake. Cool 5 minutes in pan before turning out on a rack to cool completely.",
