    "ins": "Heat enough of the oil to coat the bottom of a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry slices of eggplant until browned and slightly crispy. Place them on paper towels to drain.\nMeanwhile, place the chocolate in a heat proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat.\nArrange the eggplant slices on a large serving platter and drizzle the chocolate over them. Don't cover the eggplant completely. Serve immediately.",
