    "des": "\"This is a fun appetizer for those that enjoy flavor and zing.  Fresh green onions are wrapped in cream cheese and corned beef slices. It's very easy to make and can be done ahead of time.  Served on a colorful flat dish, they are very showy. They make a lovely addition to a spicy or deli-style meal.\"",
    "ins": "Trim the green onion stalks so that only a small amount of green remains.\nFold the corned beef slices in half to form triangles. Spread the slices with equal amounts of cream cheese. Place the green onions on the cream cheese. Roll the corned beef slices so that the green onion stalks stick out slightly. Serve chilled.",
