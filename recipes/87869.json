    "des": "\"Macaroni and cheese is perfect supper food. It's a kids' favorite, and adults like it too. My recipe is simple and almost as quick as the boxed variety. Try this variation with bacon and caramelized onions.\"",
    "ins": "Follow the recipe for Creamy Macaroni and Cheese using Vermont white cheddar.\nFry bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of bacon drippings. Add onions and thyme; saute until soft and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir bacon and onions into macaroni. Serve hot.",
