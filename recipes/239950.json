    "des": "\"These delicious cupcakes are a nice alternative to traditional pumpkin spice muffins and have a much sweeter, lighter pumpkin flavor. They are made with a yellow cake mix and have a nice fluffy texture. Topped with cream cheese frosting and served cold, they are a wonderful fall treat!\"",
