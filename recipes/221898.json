    "ins": "Season beef medallions with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Cook beef until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove beef to a warm plate.\nReduce heat to medium; cook and stir mushrooms, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, olive oil, and a pinch of salt in the skillet until mushrooms are very well browned, about 10 minutes.\nMix in tomato sauce; cook and stir until tomato sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.\nPour in Marsala wine and increase heat to high. Cook, scraping browned bits from bottom of skillet. Once most of the wine has evaporated, stir in broth and bring to a boil; cook and stir until broth mixture has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.\nReduce heat to low and return beef to broth mixture; simmer until beef is cooked to medium-rare, about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer beef to serving plates.\nRemove skillet from heat. Cook and stir 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and oregano into the sauce until butter melts. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.\nSpoon sauce over beef and serve immediately.",
