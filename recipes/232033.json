    "des": "\"Looks like a lot of ingredients- but is very simple and quick to prepare. Marinade can be prepared night before and let chicken absorb more flavors.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together yogurt, olive oil, vinegar, oregano, green onion, cumin, salt, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the chicken breast halves and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour to overnight.\nPreheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish.\nRemove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard used marinade. Arrange chicken in prepared baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes, turning occasionally. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with spearmint before serving.",
