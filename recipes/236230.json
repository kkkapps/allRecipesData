    "des": "\"Simple, healthy soup with no necessary extra salt, sugar, oils, or processed food or what not. I had the idea for the recipe while reading Dr. Neil Fuhrman's book 'Eat to Live,' where he suggested making your own tomato paste with tomatoes, garlic, and onions; I figured that'd make an excellent soup base! It also goes wonderfully with fresh biscuits.\"",
    "ins": "Puree tomatoes in a food processor.\nPour pureed tomatoes into a large pot and place over medium heat. Stir onion, garlic, basil, chives, orange zest, and lemon zest into the tomatoes; cook at a simmer until slightly frothy, 7 to 10 minutes.\nStir potatoes, mushrooms, black beans, and salt into the tomato mixture; continue simmering until the potatoes are tender, at least 30 minutes.",
