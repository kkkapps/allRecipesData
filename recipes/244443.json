    "ins": "Thread a strawberry, pineapple and cake on a skewer, repeating two more times per skewer. Heat the honey and lime juice in the microwave for 30 seconds and brush on each skewer.\nLine the Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil on the grill, dull side facing the food and punch holes all over to allow the juices to drip through. Cook on low, turning the skewers to evenly brown all of the sides.\nOnce they are browned, remove them from the grill. Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave, for 45 seconds, and drizzle the melted chocolate on the fruit skewers.\nServe and enjoy some yourself!",
