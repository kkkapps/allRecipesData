Transfer peaches to a plate.\nBrush remaining oil onto both sides of chicken breasts and season with salt.\nCook chicken on grill until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Slice chicken into thin pieces and cut peaches into 1/2-inch thick pieces.\nToss arugula and dressing together in a bowl. Divide dressed arugula among plates; top with peaches and chicken.",
