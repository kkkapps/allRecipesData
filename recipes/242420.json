    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe one day standing in front of the freezer for inspiration. The swai is a 'meaty' fish that when coupled with Asiago and Miracle Whip\u00c2\u00ae tastes like crab cakes without the hassle. Side with steamed broccoli or any fresh vegetable that is steamed.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPut bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Press swai fish, skin-side down, in bread crumbs. Spread creamy salad dressing onto exposed side of each fillet. Arrange fillets in a baking dish and top with Asiago cheese; season with salt and pepper.\nBake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 45 to 60 minutes.",
