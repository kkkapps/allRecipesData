    "des": "\"Tired of purchasing canned dog food our two large rescue dogs wouldn't eat, I decided to make pooch-friendly chow that was savory and good for them. I use converted rice, but pasta, bulgur, or quinoa may all be substituted.\"",
    "ins": "Combine rice and safflower oil in a saucepan over medium heat; stir and cook 2 minutes. Add the water, thyme, garlic powder, and bouillon. Cover, and cook 15  minutes more over medium heat, or until liquid is absorbed.\nMeanwhile, cook the ground lamb in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, then stir into the rice along with the Monterey Jack cheese until the cheese melts. Cool completely before serving.",
