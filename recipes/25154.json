    "des": "\"This is a French-style spinach salad that should satisfy even the meat-lovers at the table. Features bacon lardons, which are simply crouton-size pieces of slab bacon, fried until crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.\"",
    "ins": "Trim the rind from the bacon and cut into 1 inch cubes.  Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until brown and crispy.  Cover and reduce heat to lowest setting to keep bacon warm.\nIn a small, dry skillet, toast curry powder over medium heat, stirring often, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Remove from heat.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar and mustard.  Add oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until the oil is completely incorporated. Add curry powder and whisk until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nIn a large bowl, toss together the bacon, spinach, mushrooms and vinaigrette until evenly coated.  Adjust salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.",
