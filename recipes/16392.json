    "des": "\"Great for any occasion, and absolutely delicious. Excellent served with noodles (or mashed potatoes) and corn. Substitute white bread for wheat bread if you're looking for a healthier meal. For the fresh bread crumbs, use 6 to 8 slices bread crumbled into tiny pieces.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a medium saucepan over medium high heat, saute the carrot and onion for 2 minutes, or until onion is transparent. Add garlic and saute for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.\nIn a large bowl, combine the parsley, beef, ketchup, 1/2 cup tomato sauce, bread and eggs, mixing well. Add the carrot/onion mixture and continue mixing, but do not over mix, as this will make the meatloaf dry. Transfer mixture to a 9x13 baking dish and form into a loaf.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes.\nWhile loaf is baking, heat the remaining tomato sauce and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Pour over loaf when done.",
