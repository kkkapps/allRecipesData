    "ins": "Bring the water, sugar, cinnamon, and clove to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then remove from the heat, stir in the coffee grounds, cover, and steep for 5 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and chocolate syrup, then strain through several layers of cheesecloth to remove the coffee grounds and spices. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.",
