    "des": "\"This recipe is one my father taught me. It is the simplest homemade marinade! Just 5 common ingredients! When used overnight, the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic make flank, skirt and sirloin steaks flavorful and, most importantly, tender for the grill! For more flavor, add Kosher salt and cracked black pepper to your steak while it cooks. Red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar may be substituted for the red wine.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the vegetable oil, soy sauce, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag.\nTo use the marinade, place the meat in the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight. Discard the marinade after it has been used.",
