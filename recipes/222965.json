    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir olive oil, jalapeno pepper, and red pepper flakes into the melted butter; cook until the flavors of the peppers infuse into the butter mixture, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard the jalapeno slices if desired; they will make this dish really hot if you leave them in. Stir white wine into the butter mixture; cook another 5 minutes. Add shrimp and capers. Increase heat to medium; cook and stir the shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Add drained pasta to the shrimp mixture; toss to coat. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.",
