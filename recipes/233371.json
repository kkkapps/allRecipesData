    "des": "\"Taste buds rejoice! Tender steaks of beef tenderloin get the royal treatment with herbs and a horseradish and Dijon mustard coating. Prep this entree for marinating a day ahead and then just bake it in the oven.\"",
    "ins": "Stir mustard, horseradish, basil, thyme, tarragon, and black pepper together in a small bowl; spread evenly over one side and around the edges of the steaks. Wrap steaks individually with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 24 hours.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil and set a roasting rack into the dish.\nRemove steak from plastic wrap; season with salt. Put steaks onto the roasting rack.\nCook the steaks until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).",
