    "des": "\"A Cuban lady down the street made these every Wednesday...wonderful stuff! She served the beans over a bowl of hot rice, and garnished them with salsa, a little sour cream, and shredded cheese. It was also good without the dairy products. Can substitute canned, rinsed beans to cut cooking time.\"",
    "ins": "Place beans in a large saucepan with enough water to cover, and soak 8 hours, or overnight; drain.\nHeat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and saute onion, green bell pepper, and garlic until tender.\nInto the onion mixture, stir the drained beans, water, tomato paste, pimentos, and vinegar. Season with salt, sugar, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender.",
