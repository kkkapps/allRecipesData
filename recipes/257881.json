    "des": "\"This recipe comes from my in-laws and it is one of a kind! The texture is great and each slice holds together nicely. Very reminiscent of pecan pie without the nuts. Serve warm with a scoop of ice cream or cold with some whipped cream on top! Warning: This pie is extremely sweet (and good that way)!\"",
