    "des": "\"This is an authentic version of the popular wine drink.  You can add any fruit that you want, but I find that apples and pears absorb all the rum.  This one is not diluted with carbonated beverages.  I have much success with red Burgundy wine and white rum, though spiced rum is nice too.\"",
    "ins": "Have the fruit, rum, wine, and orange juice well chilled. Slice the lemon, lime and orange into thin rounds and place in a large glass pitcher. Pour in the rum and sugar. Chill in refrigerator for 2 hours to develop the flavors.\nWhen ready to serve, crush the fruit lightly with a wooden spoon and stir in the wine and orange juice. Adjust sweetness to taste.",
