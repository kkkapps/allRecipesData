    "des": "\"This is one of my mother's excellent Asian recipes. These spare ribs are marinated in light and dark soy sauce, orange juice, garlic, and peppercorn, then fried briefly. After simmering the ribs, marinade, and spices such as star anise and cinnamon for an hour, they are ready to serve with white rice. Very flavorful and tender!\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, stir together light and dark soy sauces, crushed peppercorns, garlic, and 2 tablespoons orange juice. Separate ribs between each bone into individual ribs, and place in the marinade. Cover, and set aside for at least 30 minutes. (If marinating much longer than 30 minutes, refrigerate.)\nTransfer marinade to a large stockpot, and set ribs aside. To the stockpot add remaining 1 cup orange juice, water, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and sugar. Bring to a boil.\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Carefully place ribs in oil, and fry for 2 minutes per side, or until edges are sealed. Transfer to the stockpot, and boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Cover, and simmer for 1 hour, adding hard boiled eggs at this point, if using.",
