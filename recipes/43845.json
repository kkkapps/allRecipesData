    "des": "\"Inspired by my favorite local Italian restaurant's secret recipe. After some trial and error, I think I have it. Creamy Alfredo sauce and salmon complement each other well. Spinach adds great color.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine, and cook for 11 to 13 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, and blend with milk. Mix in the flour to thicken. Gradually stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted.\nCrumble salmon into the butter mixture. Stir in the spinach, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, and oregano. Cook and stir about 3 minutes, until heated through. Serve over the cooked pasta.",
