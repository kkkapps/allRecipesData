    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCream together the butter or margarine, confectioner's sugar, flour and peppermint extract.  Mix well.\nSeparate dough into two equal parts, put into separate bowls and  tint with food-coloring.  Roll dough into SMALL balls, approximately 1/2 tsp per cookie.  Place six balls in a circle, alternating colors  onto cookie sheet.\nBake for 8 minutes.    NOTE:  I guess you could omit peppermint flavoring or substitute it, but we like  peppermint, so I have not tried variations or substitutions .",
