    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)\nMix the chopped nuts, flour, and salt together in a small mixing bowl. Cut in butter until lumps are the size of small peas. Press into a 9 inch pie pan. Lightly press a double layer of aluminum foil into the pastry-lined pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove foil and set crust aside to cool.\nBeat the cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Fold in whipped cream and lemon juice. Spread over cooled crust. Refrigerate.\nCombine 2/3 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, and 1/4 cup lemon juice in a saucepan. Stir in huckleberries and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Simmer and stir until thickened and no longer cloudy, about 2 minutes. Cool. Spread huckleberry mixture over cream cheese layer and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
