    "des": "\"This recipe calls for both a bread maker and an oven, and is more rich and flavorful than most -- you just can't find many panettone recipes that have rum or cream. It took a while to perfect this recipe, but feel free edit it to your own liking! Enjoy this beautiful bread during the holidays!\"",
    "ins": "Place the milk, cream, rum, vanilla extract, butter, eggs, sugar, salt, lemon zest, flour, and yeast into the pan of a bread machine in the order listed. Set machine to Bread Dough for a 1.5 pound loaf; press start.  When dough has been kneaded 10 minutes, add the candied fruit, raisins, and chopped almonds and continue to knead.\nGrease 2 9x5-inch pans. When the kneading and rising cycles of the bread machine have completed, remove the dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured board and divide into two equal portions. Spread dough into prepared bread pans. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; allow to rise for 1/2 hour.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the egg white, water, 1/4 cup sugar, and the sliced almonds. Spoon mixture evenly over loaves.\nBake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool on rack for 5 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
