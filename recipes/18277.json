    "ins": "Slice tomatoes and peppers and set aside.  Slice the red onion and separate the rings.  Using a large bowl with a lid, layer the tomatoes, green pepper and onion until all vegetables are used.  Shake the bottled dressing and pour over the vegetable layers.  Refrigerate for 2-3 hours or, for best results, overnight.  Before serving, turn bowl upside down to make sure all vegetables are coated with the dressing.",
