    "des": "\"This soup is called  \"fideo\" or \"sopa seca\" -- dry soup --  and is eaten all over Mexico. It is inexpensive and easy to make.  This can be comforting when sick but, it is a GREAT side dish with any kind of meat, poultry, fish. To make it more soupy you can add vegetable broth to taste.\"",
