    "ins": "Place the rhubarb, sugar, cloves, and lemon juice into a large stockpot over low heat. Cover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb begins to release its juice, soften, and break apart, about 10 minutes. Turn up the heat, bring the rhubarb mixture to a full rolling boil, and stir in the gelatin mix until the gelatin powder has dissolved. Remove from heat, cool to room temperature, and sweeten to taste with honey.",
