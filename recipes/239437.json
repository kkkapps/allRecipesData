Cook and stir onion, zucchini, and carrot in hot oil until the onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to a plate to cool.\nMix cooled vegetables with 3 cups of the cooled quinoa in a large bowl; season with garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Pour eggs and ground oats into the bowl; stir until the mixture comes together. Divide mixture into 14 portions and shape into patties.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
