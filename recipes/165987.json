    "des": "\"I've been drinking cosmopolitans for 5 years, and you rarely find a bartender who can make one correctly. My favorite bartender is quitting and has finally let me in on her secret. Grand Marnier. Who'd have thought? I realize it is expensive, but if you want the best, you have to pay for it. This recipe will make an addict out of you. Not so sure that's a good thing - but one thing is for sure - this is the best cosmo you will ever taste in your entire life. Period!\"",
    "ins": "Pour the Grand Marnier(R), triple sec, vodka, and cranberry juice into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into a chilled martini glass, and garnish with a lime twist to serve.",
