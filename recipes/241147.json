    "des": "\"Absolutely delicious, light, healthy Japanese-style noodles in a miso broth, with seared shrimp and chicken. \n\nQuick, easy and so good, you will love. I guarantee.\n\n Some of the ingredients might be difficult to find if you live outside a city, but it's absolutely worth going to an Asian/Japanese supermarket to find them! Also, they tend to keep well - so spend $10 on them now and you can make this lots of times.\"",
    "ins": "Soak wakame in a bowl of cold water; set aside.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken and shrimp until chicken is no longer pink in the center and shrimp is bright pink, 5 to 10 minutes.\nBring 1 pint cold water to a boil and stir in dashi powder; reduce heat to medium and add vermicelli. Mix miso paste and about 2 tablespoons hot dashi broth together in a bowl; pour back into broth and stir until miso is incorporated. Keep liquid at a simmer until noodles are tender, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup hot water to broth if taste is too strong.\nDrain wakame. Add wakame, chicken-shrimp mixture, seafood sticks, red chile pepper, soy sauce, and sesame seeds to broth and mix well. Transfer mixture to serving bowls and top with spring onions.",
