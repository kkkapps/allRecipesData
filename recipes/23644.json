As the dough mixes, sprinkle on oregano and basil until it suits you for color and taste.  Let mix for about 15 to 30 minutes. Let the dough rest from 5 to 30 minutes. The longer it rests, the thicker and more tasty the crust. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).\nRoll out dough on a lightly floured surface. Spray a large pizza pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Place dough on pan and add your choice of pizza toppings.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.",
