    "des": "\"This drink originated in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. There are several different variations. I added the lime juice myself for the extra zing. Very fruity to cover the taste of alcohol. The primary flavours are coconut and pineapple. Garnish with a cherry, some orange peel, or a lime wedge.\"",
