Stir in the onion and cook for 4 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the chicken bouillon, adobo sauce, sugar, tomatoes, corn, black beans and water. Pour in additional water if desired to reach your desired consistency. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in the cilantro before serving.",
