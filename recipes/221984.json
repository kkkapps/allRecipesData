    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a non-stick saucepan over medium-high heat nearly to smoking. Cook and stir rice in the hot oil quickly to toast the rice, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the onion into the rice; cook and stir 1 minute more. Pour chicken broth over the rice mixture, season with garlic salt, and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and cook until the broth is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to rest 5 minutes before lifting the lid.",
