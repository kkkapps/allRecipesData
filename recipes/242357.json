    "des": "\"This is my go-to recipe when I'm in a hurry. It's so easy, and yet so good. Because of the coating, the chicken is always extra juicy. Kids can't tell they're nuts (looks like breading) and love it. It's healthy (and grain-free for those with allergies). Everyone asks me for the recipe...that's my cue to add it to Allrecipes!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine almond meal, paprika, sea salt, and black pepper together in a resealable bag. Put each chicken thigh into bag, 1 at a time; close bag and shake until evenly coated. Place chicken in a glass baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear,  25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
