If mixture is too dry to hold together, stir in reserved tuna juice, 1 teaspoon at a time. Divide mixture in fourths and shape each portion into a patty.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and pan-fry the patties until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain patties on paper towels.",
