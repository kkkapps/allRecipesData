    "des": "\"A way to use crunchy panko bread crumbs and delicious beer batter to make a filling main dish or a tasty appetizer. By using beer, this recipe doesn't require eggs, making it vegetarian. Use substitutions suggested in the notes to make it completely vegan. Use garden vegetables and herbs to make your own marinara sauce to add an extra special touch!\"",
    "ins": "Place eggplant on paper towels; cover with 1 teaspoon salt. Let sit until moisture is drawn out, 10 to 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat canola oil in a deep fry pan over medium heat.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; add the leek. Cook and stir until leek is slightly translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in spinach; cook until slightly wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until spinach is fully wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.\nCombine panko, Parmesan cheese, and parsley in a bowl. Whisk flour, paprika, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl; pour in beer. Whisk until batter is loose, adding more beer if batter is too thick. Dredge eggplant in the batter, allowing excess to run off; coat in panko mixture.\nDrop 1 pinch of panko into the canola oil to test the heat. It should bubble up without splattering out. Fry battered eggplant for 30 seconds; flip. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Place on a paper towel to drain.\nCombine spinach mixture, ricotta cheese, salt, and pepper in a bowl; spread an even amount onto 4 of the fried eggplant slices. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese; cover with a second slice of fried eggplant. Top with mozzarella cheese. Place onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, about 10 minutes.",
