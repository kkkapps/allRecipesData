    "des": "\"I found this idea on the internet and have fiddled around with different flavor combinations. The kids like these because I give each child a 6-cup muffin tin and each chooses what goes in their 6 cups. They usually make three savory and three sweet. These are quick and easy. If you don't have puff pastry then try pie crust, ready made biscuit dough or crescent dough. Easy dinner in a puff!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCut puff pastry into 6 equal squares about 4 inches diagonally and 1/4-inch thick. Push each square into a muffin cup and gently press down. Place 1 tablespoon goat cheese into each pastry. Spoon 1 tablespoon avocado into 3 of the pastries and 1 tablespoon jam into the other 3 pastries.\nBake in the preheated oven until bottoms are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Top the avocado puffs each with 1 slice sun-dried tomatoes. Sprinkle pine nuts over all the puffs.",
