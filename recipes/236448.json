    "des": "\"This recipe is bright, creamy, salty, and slightly burned and crunchy. It's a delightful sensory experience, and also kind-of healthy, if you believe in that sort of thing! Also, this recipe would make a great paleo dinner with some spiraled veggie pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nCombine broccoli, red bell peppers, and yellow onion in a large bowl. Add olive oil, juice of 2 limes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; toss to coat. Spread vegetables onto a baking sheet.\nRoast vegetables, stirring 1 or 2 times, in the preheated oven until edges begin to blacken, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool slightly.\nFill a large pot with water and 1/2 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.\nBlend avocados, juice of 2 limes, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor or blender until sauce is smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Add 1/2 cup chopped cilantro and pulse until just incorporated.\nGently toss pasta, roasted vegetables, and sauce together in a large bowl. Garnish with cherry tomatoes, cilantro stems, sea salt, and black pepper.",
