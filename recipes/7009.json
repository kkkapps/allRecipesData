    "des": "\"Slightly sweet whole wheat bread.  Use stone ground flour if available. This is a very big recipe, you may want to divide it in half.\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve brown sugar in 1 cup hot water.  Add shortening, and stir to melt.  Let cool.\nIn a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 4 cups warm water.  Add white sugar, salt, and bread flour.  Beat well.  Stir in shortening mixture.  Stir in enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff but not dry dough.\nTurn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and elastic.  Place in a large, well oiled bowl.  Cover, and allow to rise until dough doubles in bulk.\nDivide dough into four equal parts.  Shape into loaves.  Place in greased, 9 x 5 inch pans,  turning each loaf over in pan to grease top.  Allow to rise until dough doubles in bulk.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes. Let cool before slicing.",
