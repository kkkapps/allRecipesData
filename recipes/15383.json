    "ins": "In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.\nIn a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, and sugar. Beat the egg yolks into the yeast mixture, and mix into the dry ingredients. Stir in the vanilla extract and melted butter.\nIn a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until stiff peaks form. Carefully fold into the waffle batter. Let stand in a warm place about 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.\nPreheat a Belgian-style waffle iron, and coat with cooking spray. Place 3/4 to 1 cup of batter onto the hot iron; close the lid. Cook until the steaming subsides and the waffle is golden brown.",
