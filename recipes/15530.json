    "des": "\"A yummy Cajun dish. Chicken, sausage, onion and celery with a seasoning including cayenne pepper and garlic. And of course, what Cajun dish would be complete without the roux?!\"",
    "ins": "Saute chicken and sausage in a large skillet for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove meat from skillet, add green onions and onion and saute until soft. Set aside.\nTo Make Roux: In a small saucepan stir together oil and flour over low heat; cook until color is caramel and mixture is reduced to 1 cup of roux. Set aside.\nPut water in a large pot. Add the chicken, sausage, onion mixture, celery, seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt, ground black pepper and garlic. Bring all to a boil and cook for 20 minutes. Add 1/2 cup roux and stir together; the mixture should have the consistency of chowder. If necessary, add the remaining 1/2 cup roux.\nReduce heat to medium low and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Serve hot over rice, if desired.",
