    "des": "\"This easy side dish is a great compliment to any meal.  Even the picky eaters will devour this vegetable side.  Bacon and balsamic vinegar combine with raw sugar to give a sweet and tart finish with a gourmet look.\"",
    "ins": "Cook the minced bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the fat has rendered out and the bacon has begun to crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leave the bacon fat in the skillet. Add the sugar snap peas, and toss to coat with the fat. Cook and stir until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Pour in the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and cooked bacon. Continue cooking until the balsamic has reduced, and the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately.",
