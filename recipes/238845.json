    "des": "\"This is my take on the classic Korean fried chicken sauce. I like to add lots of green onion and garlic, and not cook this quite as long. The result is a sauce with those ingredients a little more in the flavor profile's forefront. Try to find Korean chili flakes and/or paste if you can. I've used them before and the flavor is great (and obviously more authentic), but if you can't, any hot chili flakes or paste will work.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk ketchup, green onion, garlic, lemon juice, honey, chile-garlic sauce, red pepper flakes, and black pepper together in a saucepan over medium-high heat; add enough water to reach desired sauce consistency. Bring sauce to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thick and flavors blend, about 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature and season with salt.",
