    "des": "\"Mike came up with this recipe during the first dinner we cooked together in our brand-new apartment! We were inspired by a similar dish we've had at an Italian restaurant, but used it as a side dish instead of an antipasti plate, and substituted the prosciutto with bacon. The cheese, a relatively mild cow's milk cheese, should be relatively easy to find because of its increasing popularity. Super easy to make, and super tasty!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes.\nStir asparagus and grape tomatoes into the garlic and drizzle with lemon juice. Continue to cook and stir until asparagus are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.\nWrap 3 asparagus spears with 1 slice of bacon. Repeat with remaining asparagus and bacon, making 4 bundles. Arrange wrapped asparagus on a baking sheet.\nScatter cooked grape tomatoes around the wrapped asparagus.\nBake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, then scatter Taleggio cheese atop asparagus; return baking sheet to the oven.\nContinue baking until bacon is crisp, 5 to 7 minutes more.",
