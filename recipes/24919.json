    "des": "\"I have been making this Mexican-inspired dip for years. It's similar to a dip seen in advertisements for processed American cheese, but with my own twists. It's great as an appetizer, but this hearty mixture of beef, cheese and refried beans can also be served as a full meal. Serve with tortilla chips.\"",
    "ins": "Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.\nPlace processed American cheese and milk in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stirring frequently, cook until cheese is melted. One at a time, mix in ground beef, salsa, black olives and refried beans. Keep the mixture warm over low heat while serving.",
