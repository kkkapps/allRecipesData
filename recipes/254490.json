This is enough brine for 8 pounds of whole chicken or bone-in chicken pieces and up to 10 pounds of skinless, boneless chicken breasts.\"",
    "ins": "Mix salt, brown sugar, garlic, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Pour in water; stir until dissolved. Mix in molasses and soy sauce. Let stand until brine comes to room temperature, about 50 minutes.",
