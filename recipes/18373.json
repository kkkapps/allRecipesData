    "ins": "Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan with butter. Spread the crushed nuts evenly in the greased pan.\nIn a medium saucepan melt the butter and sugar.  Let it cook, stirring constantly, for five minutes until it is brown and almost smoking. Pour the mixture into the pan over the nuts. Immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top of the mixture so they will melt and spread the melted chocolate over the mixture. Sprinkle additional ground nuts on top if you wish.  Let the candy cool before cutting it into bars.",
