    "des": "\"This chicken is quick, simple, delicious and has an elegant presentation!  If you don't have prosciutto handy you can use bacon.  Make it really special and throw in a variety of exotic mushrooms, shiitake, portabello, oyster, etc. It can be prepared ahead of time and thrown in the oven when ready. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes, buttered noodles or basmati rice.\"",
