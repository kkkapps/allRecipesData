Unfortunately, store-bought guacamole often has low-avocado content and high calories, and homemade guacamole requires several other fresh ingredients, lots of chopping, and often added salt. This light, simple guacamole is quick and easy to make. Top tacos or any spicy, Mexican-style dish with a tablespoon or two for a heart-healthy bonus! Store in refrigerator.\"",
