    "des": "\"I experimented with the ingredients that I had in an attempt to make a stew that resembled the lamb and plum stew from 'The Hunger Games' by Suzanne Collins. The stew in the book used lamb, but I opted to use beef since it's easier to find. It's rich, warms your belly, and super easy to make if you've got time to let it simmer. I like to serve it with a loaf of French bread, but goes well with mashed potatoes as well.\"",

Cook bacon in the onion mixture until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.\nHeat wine in a separate pot over medium heat until simmering. Add dried plums to wine and cook for about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms, cover pot, and reduce heat to low.\nCook and stir tomatoes and beef into bacon mixture until beef is browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer bacon and beef mixture to the wine mixture. Add mustard powder, sage, cloves, salt, and pepper. Cook stew over medium heat for 2 1/2 hours.",
