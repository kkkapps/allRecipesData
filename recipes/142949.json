    "des": "\"This is a creamy butternut squash ('ahuyama' is the South American name) soup that is easy to make and even children will eat. You can substitute pumpkin or hubbard squash if you like, and vegetable broth for the chicken broth.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic, curry powder, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the onion has turned translucent, 5 to 8  minutes.\nStir the chicken stock and squash into the onion mixture. Simmer the soup over medium heat until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, and stir in the nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, and peanut butter. Transfer the mixture in batches to a blender or food processor; blend until smooth, slowly pouring in the cream. Reheat soup if necessary, but do not boil. Serve garnished with parsley.",
