    "des": "\"This is my favorite comfort dish which was the signature dish of my Aunt Anna in Mass City, MI. Ingredients are as for those in most any Upper Peninsula Finnish-style pasty, but cooked without a crust. When I make it, I just can't stop eating it, either hot or cold! Somehow the ingredients meld together for a wonderfully tasty, one-dish meal which is considerably more healthy than pasty with a crust. When serving, pass the ketchup, along with a side of your favorite coleslaw.\"",

Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.\nMix ground beef, potatoes, carrots, onion, rutabaga, water, salt, and pepper together in a casserole dish; top with butter. Cover dish with an oven-safe cover or aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; stir and add more water if needed. Continue baking until vegetables are tender, about 1 more hour.",
