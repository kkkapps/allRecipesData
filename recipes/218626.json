    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, crumble the bacon into a large salad bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings, and let cool.\nMix the bacon drippings and mayonnaise into the crumbled bacon until thoroughly combined; stir in tomatoes and cucumbers. Season to taste with kosher salt, five-peppercorn blend, and cumin. Allow to chill for at least 1 hour before serving (overnight is better).",
