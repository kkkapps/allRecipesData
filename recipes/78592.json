    "des": "\"This is my wing recipe that I've tweaked over the last 10 years to suit my specific tastes.  If you don't like vinegar and cayenne; these wings will not be for you.  I've never seen a middle ground with this recipe; they are either raved about or politely passed up.  If you like a hotter wing experience, double the amounts of chili powder and cayenne powder. Enjoy with chunky blue cheese or ranch dressing.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together the red wine vinegar, malt vinegar, salad dressing, hot pepper sauce, 1 tablespoon chili powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic, oregano and horseradish.\nHeat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). In a separate bowl, mix together the flour and 3 tablespoons of chili powder. Dredge the wings in the seasoned flour.\nDeep fry the wings for about 15 minutes, or until dark brown but not burnt. Drain briefly, then throw them into the bowl with the sauce. Stir to coat liberally. If you enjoy a hotter rather than tangy wing, liberally dash more hot pepper sauce onto the already sauce-coated wings.",
