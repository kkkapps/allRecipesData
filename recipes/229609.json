    "des": "\"I had an larger-than-expected harvest from my habanero plant and came up with this idea for a bloody mary with a kick. Also pretty good without the vodka as a morning start-me-up drink. The longer it sets, the hotter it gets. I have yet to have a batch make it past the 2nd day.\"",
    "ins": "Place habanero pepper, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, cumin, and salt in a blender. Blend until smooth. Adjust level of spice by adding more habanero pepper, if desired. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.\nFill 2 old fashioned glasses with ice, pour 2 ounces of vodka in each glass, and top off with bloody mary mix.",
