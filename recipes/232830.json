Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and broth has been absorbed, about 15 minutes.\nCook and stir bacon and onion in a skillet over medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer and drain mixture on a paper towel-lined plate. Cook spinach in the remaining bacon drippings until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir quinoa, onion-bacon mixture, and cilantro into spinach until evenly blended.",
