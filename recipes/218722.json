    "des": "\"Beef short ribs are a highly flavorful cut; this method of cooking makes the meat so tender you won't need a knife.  The thick rich sauce is delicious served with mashed potatoes and the carrots that cook with the ribs.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nHeat oil over medium heat in a large, heavy, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven, and brown the ribs on all sides, about 5 minutes, working in batches if necessary. Sprinkle ribs with salt and black pepper as they brown. Transfer cooked ribs to paper towels to blot up extra oil.\nStir the onion rings and carrots into the same pot, and cook and stir until the onions turn translucent and start to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Mix in tomato sauce, barbeque sauce, and beef broth; bring the sauce to a boil, and simmer for 1 minute to blend flavors. Stir in the browned ribs.\nCover the pot, and bake in the preheated oven until the rib meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Turn the ribs occasionally while cooking. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving hot.",
