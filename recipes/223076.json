    "des": "\"This soup takes the flavor of enchiladas and turns it into a soup that is both savory and hearty.  It's good on those blustery winter days, or nippy fall days!  It can easily be prepped, frozen, and then popped into a slow cooker.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a dutch oven or large pot; cook chicken breasts in boiling water over medium-high heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
