    "des": "\"My take on the Ponchartrain sauce served at a popular seafood restaurant chain in my town. Although I prefer Snapper, it may be ladled over any grilled, blackened, steamed, or pan fried fish. Very elegant and easy! Great idea for a romantic candlelight dinner for two.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, saute mushrooms in 1 teaspoon  butter until tender. Stir in shrimp, and cook until pink. Transfer to a bowl.\nIn the same saucepan, melt the remaining 2 teaspoons butter.  Slowly mix in cream. Stir in the shrimp and mushroom mixture, and season to taste with garlic powder and black pepper.  Simmer over very low heat until thick.  Just before serving, stir in wine.",
