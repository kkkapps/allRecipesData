    "des": "\"Oatmeal is a great way to start the day and this is a recipe I have developed over the years. It's delicious, light, and great with milk to help cool it down. You can replace the milk with soy milk, if desired. You can add the blueberries earlier in the cooking process if you like them hotter and plumper.\"",
    "ins": "Combine water and salt together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add oats; cook and stir until halfway tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir flax, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract into oatmeal; continue cooking until oats are tender, water is boiled off, and desired cereal consistency is reached, 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir milk and blueberries into oatmeal.",
