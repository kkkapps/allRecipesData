    "des": "\"This is a wonderful baked appetizer blending the tastes of Cheddar cheese and jalapeno peppers. The amount of jalapenos used can easily be adjusted to personal taste, although baking does take a lot of the burn out of the peppers. I've made this several times and I never have leftovers.  My husband wishes I would make these for him every day.  I don't recommend doubling the recipe; make multiple batches instead.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the eggs into a food processor, and process until light and frothy. Add Cheddar cheese, onion, and jalapeno peppers, and process until smooth. Pour into an ungreased 8x8 inch baking pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until set, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes; cut into squares to serve.",
