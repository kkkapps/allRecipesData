    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCoat an 8 inch round baking dish with the butter. Arrange bacon in a spiral fashion in the baking dish, draping ends of the slices over the pan edge to fold over filling.\nArrange 1/3 of the potatoes over bacon, and sprinkle with 1/3 Fontina cheese. Repeat layers with remaining potatoes and cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Fold bacon over filling to form the upper layer.\nBake uncovered in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender. Drain any drippings, and cut into wedges to serve.",
