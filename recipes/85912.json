    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper baking cups.\nStir together the baking mix, white sugar, egg, and milk in a bowl just until combined. Stir in 1/2 of the cherry pie filling. Fill the lined muffin cups 2/3 full. Top each muffin with 3 cherries from the remaining cherry pie filling.\nMix flour, brown sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon together in a small bowl with a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over unbaked muffins.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 22 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
