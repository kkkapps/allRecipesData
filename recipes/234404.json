    "des": "\"Spicy seasoned chicken thighs are cooked in Spanish rice. This is a good meal for a busy evening. After seasoning chicken and browning, it is left to cook while you tend to other preparations. This can be very spicy.\"",
    "ins": "Season chicken thighs with Creole seasoning.\nMelt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook chicken in the melted butter until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate. Add tomatoes with green chile peppers, water, tomato sauce, and Spanish-style rice mix to the same skillet; stir well. Return chicken to the rice mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and rice is tender, about 40 minutes. Serve on a platter with chicken atop the rice.",
