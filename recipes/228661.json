    "des": "\"A slightly different recipe using a combination of ingredients, this meatloaf tastes absolutely divine! Instead of the usual ketchup, tomato paste, and brown sugar, this meatloaf is more of an 'upscale' version of the traditional. Best served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. This is my own personal creation! I substitute ground deer meat occasionally instead of beef, only because I have a freezer full, and it's organic!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.\nMix eggs, spinach, mushrooms, bread crumbs, onion, milk, blue cheese, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, cayenne pepper, oregano, basil, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Add ground beef and mix thoroughly with your hands; pack into prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
