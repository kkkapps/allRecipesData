    "des": "\"Like pineapple fried rice, but with the ancient grain quinoa. Simple to make and bursting with Asian flavors! Always nice with fresh pineapple, but canned or frozen work well, too.\"",
    "ins": "Rinse quinoa until water runs clear. Bring the quinoa, chicken broth and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nBeat the eggs in a bowl. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs until scrambled. Remove eggs from the skillet and set aside. Heat peanut oil and chili oil over medium-low heat. Cook and stir garlic for 2 minutes, then stir in green onions to heat through. Stir in pineapple and cilantro, then add the cooked quinoa. Toss with scrambled eggs, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes until thoroughly heated.",
