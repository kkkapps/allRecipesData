    "des": "\"These were originally made by my Granny and are slightly sweeter and flatter than most scones. They are easy to make too - the no bake method allows me to make these on the hottest days of summer, which make them my family's favorite camping treat.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut in  butter by rubbing the mixture between your fingers until the mixture is fine and crumbly; stir in the raisins. In a small bowl, mix together the egg and milk; mix with dry ingredients to form a soft dough.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Dip cutter into flour, and stamp out scones. You may need to re roll the dough to get 12.\nHeat dry non-stick griddle over medium heat. Cook each side of the scone until slightly raised and golden brown in color. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.",
