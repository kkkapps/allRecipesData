    "ins": "Process oats in a food processor until finely ground. Mix oats, flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.\nWhisk buttermilk, milk, sugar, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and egg in a separate bowl until smooth; mix into oat mixture until batter is well-mixed, about 30 strokes. Fold raisins and walnuts into batter.\nLightly oil a skillet or griddle and place over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
