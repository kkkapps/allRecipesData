Cake is ready to frost when cool on the bottom to touch.\nMix crushed pineapple, instant pistachio pudding, and whipped topping together with a spoon, do not use an electric mixer. Frost cake and refrigerate for at least one hour.  You must keep this cake refrigerated until ready to serve and then also keep any leftovers refrigerated.",
