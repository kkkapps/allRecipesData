    "des": "\"This is a traditional potato pancake recipe, and is a wonderful comfort food. Serve with applesauce and sour cream for a light dinner, or with roast chicken for a hearty winter meal. You can use more flour if the mixture seems too wet.\"",
    "ins": "Finely grate potatoes with onion into a large bowl.  Drain off any excess liquid.\nMix in egg, salt, and black pepper.  Add enough flour to make mixture thick, about 2 to 4 tablespoons all together.\nTurn oven to low, about 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nHeat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium high heat.  Drop two or three 1/4 cup mounds into hot oil, and flatten to make 1/2 inch thick pancakes.  Fry, turning once, until golden brown.  Transfer to paper towel lined plates to drain, and keep warm in low oven until serving time.  Repeat until all potato mixture is used.",
