    "des": "\"This zucchini bread recipe is super moist and super spicy, loaded with cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. I tried several recipes before I asked my mom for her recipe. I go to the farmers market every Saturday and get these huge zucchinis, and this is the perfect use for them. It reminds me of my childhood. The loaves can be frozen and are great as gifts. People love them.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.\nBeat sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; fold in zucchini. Stir flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, baking powder, and cloves together in a separate bowl; gradually stir into sugar mixture until batter is mixed. Fold walnuts and raisins into the batter; pour into the prepared loaf pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, about 50 minutes.",
