    "des": "\"This big dessert was made for a big picnic in Tieton, Washington from locally grown fresh apricots. Tart apricots and lightly-sweetened custard with a hint of basil layer onto a rustic whole wheat and almond crust. Store tart in refrigerator until ready to serve.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, almond meal, 1 tablespoon sugar, lemon zest, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture is in pea-sized crumbles. Stir in buttermilk until dough comes together.\nPress dough evenly over the bottom and 1/2 inch up the sides of a 12x16-inch tart pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Place pan on a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.\nWhisk egg yolks, 2/3 cup sugar, and cornstarch together in a heavy-bottomed pot. Whisk in milk. Add whole basil sprigs.\nCook milk mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture begins to steam, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Remove basil sprigs with tongs and discard. Whisk vigorously until custard thickens, about 1 minute.\nSet a wire mesh strainer over a large bowl. Pour custard into the strainer; use a rubber spatula to press it through the strainer into the bowl. Whisk vanilla extract into the custard. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours.\nPour cooled custard over crust; spread evenly to edges of crust with a rubber spatula. Arrange apricot slices on top.\nScoop apricot jam into a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave on high until melted, about 1 minute. Brush jam over apricot slices.",
