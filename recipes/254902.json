    "des": "\"I found this recipe a while ago on a Swedish blog, and I have made it many times since then. I made some moderations to make it even better, and now it's the whole family's favorite snack. \nIt tastes just like Snickers\u00c2\u00ae but instead of artificial flavorings and white sugar you get healthy ingredients like almonds, dates, and dark chocolate. Try it--you won't be disappointed!\"",

Spread almond mixture into a square approximately 4x6-inches in size. Place in the freezer until hardened, about 10 minutes.\nBlend remaining 1 cup dates in the blender until smooth.\nRemove almond mixture from freezer; spread blended dates evenly on top with oiled hands. Sprinkle peanuts onto fudge; push down gently with hands until peanuts stick to blended dates. Freeze in the freezer until bars are set, about 15 minutes.\nMelt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.\nRemove bars from the freezer; cut into 5 pieces with a sharp knife. Dip bars in melted chocolate; place onto a plate to cool until hardened. Place into an airtight container; store in refrigerator.",
