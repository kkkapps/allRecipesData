Slowly pour flour mixture into sugar mixture and stir just until dough is combined; fold in pretzels and chocolate-hazelnut spread.\nDrop dough onto a baking sheet using 2 spoons.\nBake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes; rotate baking sheet and continue baking until cookies are fully cooked and still soft in the middle, about 7 minutes more. Cool cookies on baking sheet for about 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.",
