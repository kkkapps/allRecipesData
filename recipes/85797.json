    "des": "\"A delicious, creamy cheese that perks up bagels and sandwiches. Very simple to make and the variations are endless. Try to use a full fat yogurt such as Balkan style. You could easily experiment with many other ingredients such as, chopped olives, fresh herbs or sweet ingredients.\"",
    "ins": "Line a strainer with two layers of cheesecloth. In a medium bowl, mix together the yogurt, salt, pepper and garlic.\nPour into the cheesecloth lined strainer. Place the strainer over another bowl to catch the liquid, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days, until all of the liquid has drained off. Empty the drainage bowl occasionally so you can see when the cheese has stopped draining.\nTransfer cheese to a covered container, and store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.",
