    "des": "\"The distinctiveness of this turkey dressing comes from the orange-flavored liqueur, spicy Italian sausage, apples, and pecans. It's also very easy to prepare. This recipe makes enough to stuff one 18 to 20 pound bird. If you prefer, this dressing can be made with thyme instead of sage.\"",
    "ins": "Place the raisins in a small saucepan, and cover with 1 cup of liqueur.  Bring to boil, remove from heat, and set aside.\nIn a large skillet, melt 1/2 cup butter over medium heat. Saute the celery and onion in the butter for 10 minutes.  Transfer to a large mixing bowl.\nIn the same skillet, cook the sausage over medium-high heat until crumbled and evenly brown.  Drain.\nCombine the sausage and stuffing mix  with the celery and onion mixture.  Stir in the raisins and liqueur, pecans, and apples. Mix in melted butter, chicken broth, 1/2 cup orange liqueur; the stuffing should be totally moistened. Season with sage, salt, and pepper.",
