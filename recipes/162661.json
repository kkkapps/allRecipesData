    "ins": "In a large pot, combine the lima beans, ham hocks, water, cabbage and butter. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and set a lid on top but leave a crack for steam. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the lid, add the tomatoes and sausage; simmer with the lid on until beans are completely tender, 15 to 20 minutes.",
