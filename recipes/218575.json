    "des": "\"The southern region of Oaxaca, Mexico is known as the land of siete moles or  seven moles. I developed this chicken dish using the herbs and tomatillos needing to be used up. This is also known as a verde mole. It's an interesting taste difference using the mole both cooked and in the raw form in this dish. Serve alongside a Mexican style rice and a green salad.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chicken, and season with oregano, minced garlic, and salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the chicken is lightly browned. Stir in the onion, then cover and reduce heat to low.\nPlace tomatillos, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, whole garlic, lime juice, and salt in a blender. Pulse to a chunky consistency. Pour half of the tomatillo mixture over the chicken. Continue simmering until chicken is tender, 35 to 40 minutes more. Serve with remaining sauce and top with Monterey Jack cheese.",
