Meanwhile unwrap the candies.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWith floured hands, wrap about 1 tablespoon of dough around each piece of candy, completely covering the candy. Roll each ball in the remaining tablespoon of white sugar.  Place 2 inches apart on an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be set and slightly cracked.\nMelt the white chocolate chips in the microwave oven, or in a bowl over simmering water. Drizzle over the cookies when they are cool. If the melted chips are too thick, add vegetable oil to achieve the desired consistency.",
