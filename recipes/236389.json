    "des": "\"Black-eyed peas replace the traditional crackers or breadcrumbs in this recipe. The delicate flavor from the peas help bring out the crab's savory taste. There's no need to add lemon juice to these cakes: the zest ties the seasonings together. This is definitely a winning recipe: a must try!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk lemon zest, mustard powder, seafood seasoning, onion powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add black-eyed peas to lemon zest mixture and smash with a fork until mixture is crumbly. Stir egg and mayonnaise into pea mixture; gently fold in crab meat and Parmesan cheese until combined.\nForm pea mixture into 5-ounce patties. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl and press patties into bread crumbs, coating both sides. Place patties on a plate and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.",
