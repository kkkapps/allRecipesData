    "des": "\"My grandmother supported her family during the Depression by baking. This is her recipe for pie crust.  I use this often as I am a pie baker.  The trick to good pie crust is to be gentle and treat it very lightly.\"",
    "ins": "Mix shortening, flour, and salt together with a fork or a pastry blender until very crumbly.  Add as much water as needed to hold together, and mix lightly with a fork.\nRoll gently on a floured pastry cloth to about an inch larger than pie plate. Fold carefully in half, lift to pie plate, and unfold.  Press into pan.  For a single-crust pie, trim with a small knife to about 1/2 inch beyond rim.  Fold up, and pinch so edge of pie is raised from rim.",
