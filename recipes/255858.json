    "des": "\"This pie is delicious! My family raved. This is my own recipe. Being that it is an apple pie, it is very simple. Making it vegan was not hard at all either. With no animal products, the crust is very buttery and light. Serve right out of the oven, chilled, or slightly warmed and a la mode.\"",
    "ins": "Combine 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup vegan margarine, 1 tablespoon white sugar, and salt in a food processor; pulse until mixture clumps together. Pour water in slowly and pulse a few times until a dough forms.\nTransfer dough to a flat work surface; knead for 30 seconds and shape into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nDust a flat work surface with flour. Roll dough out into two 10-inch crusts. Press 1 crust gently into a 9-inch pie plate.\nCombine brown sugar, 1/2 cup vegan margarine, 1/4 cup white sugar, rice milk, 3 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until margarine melts and brown sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPlace apple slices in a large bowl. Pour brown sugar mixture on top; mix until apples are evenly coated. Pile apples into the bottom crust. Cover with the second crust. Cut slits in the top crust with a sharp knife.\nBake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and apples are semi translucent, 45 to 60 minutes.",
