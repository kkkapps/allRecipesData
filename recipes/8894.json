    "des": "\"This is a recipe to serve your mother-in-law; we call it a 'bride basic'. It differs from some Chicken Divan recipes because of the curry. Men love this. Wonderful! The ingredients can be 'assembled' and frozen, then baked when you're ready. Serve with rice and a fruit salad, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 3-quart casserole dish.\nArrange cooked broccoli in prepared baking dish. Arrange chicken over broccoli.

Mix together and pour sauce mixture over chicken and vegetables. Sprinkle cheese on top and bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes.",
