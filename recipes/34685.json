    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a shallow baking dish or pie dish.\nPlace onion, peppers, and garlic in prepared pan.  Season with freshly ground pepper, and sprinkle a little olive oil over them. Roast in preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until you think the vegetable are done.\nWhen the vegetables are tender, remove from oven. Spread tomatoes evenly over the vegetables, and sprinkle with feta cheese.  Roll out the puff pastry, and place over vegetables.\nBake for 20 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown.  Remove from oven, place a tray over the dish, and then flip it upside down so that you have a puff pastry base with the vegetables on top. Serve immediately while the puff pastry is still crisp.",
