    "des": "\"This is a recipe I came across from my friend's dad. When I tasted it and it tasted a lot like a hot pot dish I had at one of my Chinese friend's house. So I made some changes to it to make it my own.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil; add the egg noodle nests and return to a boil. Turn off the heat and let stand for 5 minutes; drain and set aside.\nHeat the peanut oil in a wok over high heat. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes; cook a few seconds until the garlic begins to turn golden. Add the chicken, green onions, and carrots. Cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the water chestnuts, mushrooms, peanut butter, oyster sauce, curry powder, and soy sauce until the peanut butter has dissolved into the sauce.\nStir the noodles into the chicken mixture; cover and reduce heat to warm or very low. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes for the noodles to absorb some of the sauce.",
