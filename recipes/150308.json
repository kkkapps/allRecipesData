    "des": "\"These sweet and tangy pork chops are flavorful and very easy to make. I pour the marinade over the pork chops in a freezer bag, then freeze them for future use. I take them out of the freezer the night before I want to serve them, and thaw in the refrigerator. By dinner time, they are ready to bake, making a quick and delicious meal!\"",
    "ins": "Place pork chops into a large resealable bag.  In a blender or food processor, combine the garlic, vinegar, soy sauce, honey, ginger, and pepper. Puree until the garlic has been finely chopped. Pour this mixture over the pork chops. Seal, and marinate in refrigerator at least 4 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the pork chops and marinade to a baking dish.\nBake uncovered in the preheated oven until the sauce has reduced, and the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes.",
