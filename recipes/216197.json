    "des": "\"This is a quick simple recipe for fresh pheasant that has a very autumn feel to it. It is very good with potatoes, carrots and seasonal squash (I like acorn squash) diced and roasted in the pan with it. You can cook it at a higher temperature for a shorter time; just be sure to baste often since it is a very dry meat.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nStir the chopped rosemary and thyme into the olive oil and set aside. Rub the pheasant inside and out with salt and pepper. Place into a close-fitting roasting pan. Pour the herb oil over top.\nBake the pheasant in the preheated oven for 1 hour, then cover with aluminum foil, and continue baking an additional hour, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone reads 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing. Baste the pheasant with the hot oil and juices from the pan every 30 minutes while cooking.",
