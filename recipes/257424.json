    "des": "\"I needed to use up some of the berries I froze last summer so I changed up my favorite sour cream cake recipe to come up with this barely-sweet cake with a whiff of almond flavor. It's great with a cup of tea or coffee. Feel free to increase the amount of sugar for a sweeter cake.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.\nCombine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in sour cream, almond extract, and vanilla extract until batter is smooth.\nStir all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking soda, baking powder, cardamom, and salt together in a bowl. Add to the batter; mix on low speed just until combined.\nSpread batter evenly in the prepared pan. Scatter berries on top. Sprinkle sliced almonds and turbinado sugar over berries.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pan; serve warm or at room temperature.",
