    "des": "\"These burgers are soft and moist. They can also be formed to make larger burgers. Serve with blue cheese dressing for a nice touch. Use more wing sauce for a hotter, more spicy burger.\"",
    "ins": "Mix ground chicken, bread crumbs, egg, and wing sauce together in a large bowl. Add enough water to the chicken mixture so it is a little sticky; shape into patties about 3 inches in diameter.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot skillet until burgers are hot and no longer pink in the middle, about 4 minutes per side. Serve on buns.",
