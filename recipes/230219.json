    "des": "\"This was one of the very first casseroles I made for my family. It was originally a green bean casserole recipe, but since I wanted this to be an (almost) all-in-one dish I added the ground chicken and eggplant. I also added more spices. My 2-year-old twins loved it and so did my hubby! It's a hearty dish that we usually eat with brown rice and/or crusty bread. It's also good served with a side of fresh and crisp green salad with tangy dressing. This casserole may be too mushy for some people. If you don't want it to turn out that way, you can substitute the ground chicken with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of cooked and cubed boneless, skinless chicken breast.\"",

Stir sour cream, onion, garlic powder, sugar, nutmeg, salt, and pepper into the flour mixture until evenly mixed; add ground chicken and green beans. Cook and stir mixture until chicken is completely browned and the onion is translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.\nArrange eggplant rounds into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread chicken and green bean mixture over the eggplant. Top with Cheddar cheese.\nMix cracker crumbs and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a bowl until crackers are evenly moistened; sprinkle over the Cheddar cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until top is golden and cheese is bubbly, about 30 minutes.",
