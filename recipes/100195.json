    "des": "\"Haddock (or other white fish) is lightly breaded and baked.  Parmesan adds a nice flavor.  Quick and easy to prepare, it's a nice alternative to deep frying.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).\nIn a small bowl, combine the milk and salt.  In a separate bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and thyme.  Dip the haddock fillets in the milk, then press into the crumb mixture to coat. Place haddock fillets in a glass baking dish, and drizzle with melted butter.\nBake on the top rack of the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily, about 15 minutes.",
