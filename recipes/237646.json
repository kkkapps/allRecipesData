    "des": "\"My mom made this cake for Mother's Day. The cake was in the oven baking. When she realized she didn't add the eggs or salt the recipe called for, she thought it would screw up the cake. But the cake came out so moist and yummy I made her write down the recipe, skipping the eggs and salt. She frosts it with vanilla frosting while the cake is still warm to give it a glazed effect. My family loves this cake.\"",
