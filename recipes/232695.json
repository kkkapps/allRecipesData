    "des": "\"These are an old favorite of mine. I use small-curd, low-fat cottage cheese. They come out thin and delicate, somewhere between a classic pancake and a crepe. A nice addition to a reduced-carb diet.\"",
    "ins": "Strain cottage cheese in a sieve fitted over a bowl, pressing down occasionally, until cottage cheese has dried out, about 1 hour.\nBeat eggs in a medium bowl; add cottage cheese, flour, melted butter, and salt. Mix until just blended.\nHeat butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat; drop large spoonfuls of batter into the melted butter. Sprinkle blueberries into batter. Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.",
