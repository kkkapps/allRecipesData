Set bowl over a hot water bath, and stir to blend ingredients. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat the galette iron.\nShape dough into 1 inch balls, and place in the galette iron. Close the iron, and cook the cookies. This should take about 30 seconds in an electric galette iron, or 2 to 4 minutes in a handheld iron over a medium flame.
