    "des": "\"This simple mixture of five spices commonly used in Chinese cooking works great as a rub or in a marinade. The ingredients may be a little more difficult to obtain, but the effort is well worth the result. This is probably one of the easiest recipes to assemble. I hope you enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Grind the anise pods, cloves, peppercorns, fennel, and cinnamon in a spice mill or with a mortar and pestle to a fine powder. Store in a sealed container in a cool dark place until needed.",
