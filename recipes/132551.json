    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Fry the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels, reserving 3 tablespoons of the drippings.\nBring the water to a boil and stir in the grits. Cook and stir over medium heat until thick, about 5 minutes. Crumble in about half of the bacon and stir in bacon drippings, processed cheese, milk and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and grits are set, about 40 minutes.",
