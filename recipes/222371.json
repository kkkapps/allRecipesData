She served them every Christmas Eve in a chafing dish as part of the 'Sm\u00c3\u00b6rg\u00c3\u00a5sbord.' My mom used to have a vegetable sour cream and a lingonberry sauce on the table for those that might want to dip these in something.\"",

Shape mixture into about 48 very small meatballs.\nMelt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet; add meatballs. Brown slowly, allowing about 25 minutes, until meatballs are fully cooked in the middle and no longer pink. Shake pan occasionally to cook evenly.",
