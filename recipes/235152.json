    "des": "\"My family and I were tired of eating the same old style of baked chicken, either shake-and-baked or just seasoned. So I got this idea and decided to try it. Needless to say, this is how we bake chicken now and the kids love it. A little sweet but always moist.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nSeason chicken thighs on all sides with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.\nPour corn muffin mix into a shallow bowl. Roll chicken thighs in corn muffin mix until well coated. Transfer coated thighs to prepared baking sheet.\nBake chicken thighs in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
