    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGrease a 9x13-inch baking dish with half the olive oil. Rub the tilapia fillets in the oil to coat both sides. Season with the Creole seasoning, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt; sprinkle with the cilantro. Drizzle the fillets with the lime juice and remaining olive oil; set aside.\nMelt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and Anaheim pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and begun to brown around the edges, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes more. Pour in the wine and simmer 1 minute, stirring constantly. Pour in the chicken stock and olives; season with cumin, cayenne pepper, oregano, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, red pepper flakes, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer about 20 minutes.\nBake the tilapia in the preheated oven until the flesh turns white and is easily flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the fish to serve.",
