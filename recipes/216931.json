    "des": "\"Ok, this is my go-to recipe for those skeptics who say vegan can't be fun and flavorful! Oh yeah ... it fools them every time! Yup, even my East Coast/Italian friends! (You know who you are)! Perfect for a potluck, generous enough for a family dinner (maybe even leftovers)! Serve with salad and crusty bread! No one will know it's not ricotta! Get crazy and experiment with other veggies in the tofu mixture like mushrooms, zucchini, peppers, swiss chard, etc. for added flavor and vitamins.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic; cook and stir until the garlic begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce, bruschetta, and salt. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, then stir in the red wine and sugar. Simmer for 30 minutes.\nPreheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray, then spread layer of the prepared tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan.\nPlace the tofu, onion, spinach, and pesto into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Pour the tofu mixture into a resealable plastic bag. Snip the corner off the bottom of the bag, and pipe the mixture into the pasta shells. Arrange the pasta shells in the prepared baking pan. Pour the remaining tomato sauce over the shells, then cover the pan with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the pasta shells are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil, and sprinkle the soy cheese on top. Return to the oven and continue baking until the the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes more.",
