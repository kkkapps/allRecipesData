    "des": "\"This is my husband's favorite rice. It took me awhile to finally come up with this version. One can add chicken, tuna, ham, etc., to make it a one dish meal. It is also great for rice patties. The vinegar is traditional in rice in Spain; it keeps the rice fluffy.\"",
    "ins": "Stir water, vegetable oil, garlic, vinegar, turmeric, and salt together in a 2-quart saucepan. Place a cover on the saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil.\nSlowly stir rice into the boiling mixture. Replace cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer rice mixture until the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.\nTransfer rice to a large bowl. Gently fold peas and carrots into rice.",
