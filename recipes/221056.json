    "des": "\"This recipe is perfect for 1.5-quart ice cream makers. It's easy to make and tastes great. Making gelato takes some trial and error to figure out the custard bases, flavors, and the quirks of your ice cream maker. Once you conquer the technique you won't believe what you can do.\"",
    "ins": "Beat milk, sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla with a wire whisk in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until beginning to thicken, about 5 minutes.\nFold the strawberries into the thickening mixture. Whisk until the strawberries soften enough to nearly dissolve into the liquid. Continue cooking until nearing a boil and thick enough for a thin layer to cling to a spoon dipped into it, about 5 minutes.\nChill in refrigerator until completely cool.\nFreeze in canister of ice cream maker according to manufacturer instructions.",
