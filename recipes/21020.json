    "des": "\"This appetizer has a lot of ingredients, but it's easy to make and is a meat lover's dream come true! Italian meats and spices are baked together inside a loaf of bread, then cut into bit-sized pieces.\"",
    "ins": "Allow frozen bread dough to thaw approximately 8 hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator. Place dough in a large, lightly greased bowl. Place bowl in a warm location, and allow dough to rise until doubled (2 to 3 hours). Punch down dough.\nPlace Italian sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.\nRoll dough into an approximately 10x14 inch rectangle on the baking sheet. Spread with yellow mustard and prepared Dijon-style mustard. Line center with cooked Italian sausage, ham, pepperoni sausage, salami, provolone cheese and American cheese. Sprinkle with oregano and basil.\nFold edges of dough over the fillings and pinch together. Tuck and pinch ends. Sprinkle with cornmeal, and flip so the seam side is down.\nBake in the preheated oven 45 minutes, or until a deep golden brown. Cool 10 minutes before cutting into bite-sized slices.",
