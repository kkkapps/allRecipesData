    "ins": "Whisk together lime juice, red wine vinegar, garlic, honey, salt, and pepper until blended. Slowly whisk in olive oil until incorporated. Mix half of this dressing with the chicken breasts, cover, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Refrigerate the remaining dressing for later use.\nHeat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.\nGrill chicken breasts until no longer pink, about 6 minutes per side. Set aside and allow to cool while proceeding with recipe. Toss together mango, black beans, bell pepper, and jicama in a large bowl with reserved dressing. Slice chicken into bite-sized pieces and toss with salad.\nTo serve, line a serving bowl with the green leaf lettuce and mound the chicken salad into the middle.",
