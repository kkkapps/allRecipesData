    "des": "\"My grandmother, Julia O'Malley (Nanny), always made this when I was growing up. It is neither Chinese, nor pie, so we don't know why it was called that - it's more like a shepherd's pie, but that's what it was called in our family. Believe it or not, this is great when you smush it all together and put ketchup on it! The kids love it!\"",

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Mash potatoes using a potato masher or fork.\nStir ground beef and white sauce together in a bowl; spread into the prepared casserole dish. Layer corn over beef mixture.\nMeasure about 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and set aside. Sprinkle the remaining Cheddar cheese over corn layer; top with mashed potatoes. Sprinkle reserved 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese over potatoes.\nBake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.",
