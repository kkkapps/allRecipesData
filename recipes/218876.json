    "des": "\"This is a wonderful breakfast casserole that will feed many. We have it every year for Christmas brunch. The family will not allow me to make anything else. I pair it with my French Toast Strata and everyone is full and happy. It's also very easy to increase the portion by putting it into a 9x13 dish and just adding extra ingredients.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nToss the potatoes with the vegetable oil in a bowl until potatoes are well coated. Press the potatoes into a 10-inch pie pan to create a crust.\nBake potatoes in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove pan from oven, and reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhile the potatoes are baking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage. Cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Combine the sausage with the eggs, mushrooms, pepperjack cheese, Swiss cheese, milk, 1 tablespoon parsley, garlic salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Pour the egg mixture into the prepared potato crust.\nBake in the oven until eggs are set, about 25 minutes. Arrange the tomato slices over the eggs and sprinkle the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon parsley on top. Return to the oven and continue baking until the tomatoes soften, about 5 minutes more.",
