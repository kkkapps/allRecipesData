    "des": "\"These are dough pockets filled with cottage cheese, boiled and served with sour cream gravy. My step-grandmother was Russian/Polish and she made these but we called them Vereneke.   If desired, serve with sour cream that is heated but not boiling, and crisp fried bacon.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine 2 eggs, milk, flour and salt and mix together to make a soft dough. Roll out thinly enough to make about twelve 4 inch squares. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil.\nIn a medium bowl, combine cheese, 2 eggs and salt. Mix together and fill dough squares with cottage cheese mixture. Pinch sides together to seal and drop in boiling water. Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes or until the squares rise to the water's surface.",
