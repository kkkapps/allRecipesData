    "des": "\"This unbaked cheese Paska was one of my mother Sofia's traditional Ukrainian Easter recipes. She passed away in 1995 so I have been making it ever since. It is easy to make, very rich,  and a hit every time. Decorate with the fruits of your choice.\"",
    "ins": "Combine farmer cheese, cream cheese, butter, and egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment; mix on low speed to combine. Add sugar, vanilla extract, lemon juice, lemon zest, and orange zest; mix until Paska mixture is smooth.\nLine a sieve with dampened cheesecloth, leaving an overhang on all sides. Place over a plate that will catch any additional liquid that drains out.\nSpoon Paska mixture into cheesecloth. Fold the ends of the cheesecloth over the mixture. Cover with a plate and set a heavy weight on top.\nChill until Paska is firm, overnight to 24 hours.\nRemove weighted plate and unfold cheesecloth ends. Use cheesecloth ends to lift Paska out. Invert onto a plate and peel away cheesecloth.",
