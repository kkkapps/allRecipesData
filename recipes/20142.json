In a medium skillet or crepe pan over medium-high heat, spoon a few tablespoon of batter and tilt pan to cover completely.  Cook, turning once, until golden, 2 minutes.  Repeat to make 6 crepes.\nFor filling:  In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine 1 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Gradually stir in  2 1/4 cups milk and chocolate, until chocolate melts and mixture thickens.  Remove from heat and stir in 3 eggs.  Return to heat and cook 2 minutes more, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and 2 tablespoons butter.  Fold in cookie pieces.\nLine a 12x15 inch loaf pan with two or three overlapping crepes.  Pour filling into lined pan.  Cover with two or three crepes.
