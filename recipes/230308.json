    "des": "\"I just wasn't satisfied with the ingredients in other cheese ball recipes. So, I made my own and took it to a Christmas party, where it was enjoyed by all. You can also experiment with other Greek-themed ingredient options such as sun-dried tomatoes, Kalamata or green olives, pepperoncini, etc. Surround cheese balls with your favorite crackers.  For a true 'Greek' theme, try toasted pita chips.\"",
    "ins": "Stir cream cheese, mayonnaise, and balsamic vinegar together in a bowl until smooth.\nMix Cheddar cheese, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder together in a separate bowl. Stir Cheddar cheese mixture into cream cheese mixture.\nPulse pecans and 1/4 cup pine nuts in a food processor or blender until crumbly. Mix remaining 1/2 cup pine nuts into pecan mixture. Spread about 1/4 of the pecan mixture onto a plate.\nForm cheese mixture into two 5-inch balls. Roll each ball in the pecan mixture until fully coated, adding more pecan mixture as needed.",
