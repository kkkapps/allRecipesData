    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\nMix together the ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, eggs, garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until just combined. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions, then roll each of those portions into 4 meatballs. Arrange the meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.",
