    "ins": "Combine 1 1/4 cup sugar, vinegar, and water in a  heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Mix in cranberries, cinnamon stick, and orange peel.  Reduce heat, and cover partially.  Simmer until berries burst, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cool completely, sauce will thicken as it cools.  Discard cinnamon stick.",
