    "des": "\"These won tons are easy and amazingly good. Trick all of your friends into thinking you are a gourmet in just 20 minutes! Please note! Won tons are best when they are eaten directly after cooking. This recipe can be made in advance, however wait to fry them until just before serving. Wasabi can be found in many common grocery stores and Asian grocery stores.\"",
    "ins": "In a small mixing bowl, combine mustard, soy sauce and wasabi until the wasabi has dissolved. Cover and refrigerate.\nPlace cream cheese in a large bowl (preferably chilled metal). Mix in crab meat, onion, water chestnuts and parsley. Place one spoonful of the mixture in the center of each won ton wrapper.  Bring points of the wrapper together (in a triangular shape) and pinch the edges closed.  If the edges do not stick together, wet your fingertips lightly with water and pinch the ends together again (this will help to hold the won ton together).\nHeat oil in a large skillet. When oil is hot, place won tons (approximately 6 at a time) into hot oil. Remove the won tons when they are golden brown. Drain them on a paper towel lined tray. Repeat this process until all won tons are fried. Serve with dipping sauce.",
