    "des": "\"HOLLAND HOUSE\u00c2\u00a0Sherry Cooking Wine adds a subtle, sweet background flavor to this spicy, Mexican seasoned marinade. Lean, boneless, skinless chicken breasts are delicious as well.\"",
    "ins": "In a blender container, combine sherry cooking wine and remaining ingredients except meat. Cover and run on high until smooth.\nTrim steak of any visible fat. Place steak in a non-metallic baking dish or sealable plastic bag. Add marinade; turn meat to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight, turning meat one or more times while marinating.\nPreheat grill to medium-high heat. Drain meat and discard marinade. Grill skirt steak about 6 minutes over direct heat with cover closed. Turn meat; grill with cover closed 2 minutes more or until cooked as desired. Flank steak will take longer to cook.\nSlice steak into thin strips across the grain. Serve with warm corn tortillas, if desired.",
