Grease or spray foil to prevent sticking.\nCombine cilantro, sour cream, jalapeno, mayonnaise, garlic and lime juice in the bowl of a food processor; season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.\nMash avocados using a potato masher. Add black beans, corn, tomato, lime juice, chili powder, cumin and salt and pepper and gently toss to combine.\nPlace avocado mixture in the center of each wrapper. Bring the bottom edge of the wrapper tightly over the filling, folding in the sides. Continue rolling until the top of the wrapper is reached. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrapper with water, pressing to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers and avocado mixture.\nPlace egg rolls on the prepared baking dish. Lightly coat with nonstick spray.\nPlace into oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, about 18 to 20 minutes.\nServe immediately with cilantro dipping sauce.",
