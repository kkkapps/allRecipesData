Pour batter into prepared pan. Cover with streusel topping.\nFor the topping:  In a bowl, combine 1/3 cup flour, cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar.  Cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nBake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.",
