    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nWhile the pasta cooks, combine the melted margarine and garlic in a shallow dish. Place the flour in another dish. Dip the tilapia filets in the garlic butter mixture and then immediately coat with the flour. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the fish in the oil until golden brown, turning once, about 5 minutes total.\nPour the cream, lemon juice, and remaining garlic and margarine mixture into the skillet. Stir in the jalapenos, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Bring to a simmer and allow to cook until sauce has reduced slightly and fish flakes easily with a fork; about 2 minutes.  Mix the baby spinach into the sauce and cook until wilted. Stir in the chopped tomato and the cooked pasta.",
