    "des": "\"This casserole is pure comfort food. During the winter, it will surely warm you and your family. Plus, it's a great way to sneak in those daily veggies in a great-tasting dish!  The cornbread really gives the casserole texture, while the squash gives it color, and it smells wonderful as it's pulled out of the oven.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nPlace the squash, carrots, onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms in a pan. Pour in enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and drain well using a sieve or colander.\nMix the sour cream, chicken broth, cream of chicken soup, eggs, Italian seasoning, and red pepper together in a large bowl. Toss the sour cream mixture with the chicken, cornbread, and 2 cups Cheddar cheese until evenly blended. Stir in the vegetable mixture. Spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the prepared baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until the center sets, about 50 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of Cheddar cheese. Bake until the cheese melts, about 10 minutes more. Serve immediately.",
