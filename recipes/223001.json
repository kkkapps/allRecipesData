    "des": "\"I needed something to bring to my niece's 4th of July party. I wanted something portable, simple to make, and of course really tasty! I love Mexican food so this recipe in inspired from south of the border, yet created in New England. You can adjust the heat on the recipe by using a hotter or milder taco seasoning.\"",
    "ins": "Stir refried beans and taco seasoning mix together in a bowl. Place soft cream cheese in a separate bowl and stir until the cream cheese is workable; thoroughly mix in the prepared guacamole.\nLay a tortilla onto a work surface and spread with 1/2 cup of bean mixture in a smooth, even layer; top with 1/2 cup of guacamole mix in a layer. Roll up the tortilla into a log and moisten the far edge with a little water to seal. Wrap rolled tortillas tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 1 hour to overnight.\nTo serve, unwrap the rolls and trim off the uneven edges of each roll; cut into 1-inch pieces. Place a piece into each cupcake paper and insert a red pepper strip into the end for a wick. Sprinkle appetizers with chopped green onion.",
