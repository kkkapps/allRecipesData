    "des": "\"This recipe is a version of kimchi I am pleased with. Your version may be quite different, and that's ok! Remember that all of the ingredients can be changed or modified to the level that you like. When my plants are producing, I like to chop up some of my onion and garlic chives to the mix. It is a good addition.\"",
    "ins": "Place bok choy in a large bowl; add 1/4 cup pickling salt and stir; cover with an upside-down plate. Let salted cabbage sit until softened and liquid has been released, 2 to 3 days. Rinse cabbage in a colander and drain.\nTransfer cabbage to a clean bowl; add 1/4 cup pickling salt, Korean chile powder, green onions, carrots, serrano chile peppers, garlic, fish sauce, and ginger and mix well.\nPack cabbage mixture into clean jars to within 1 inch of the top. Tightly secure lids onto each jar.\nRefrigerate until flavors have had time to merge and cabbage has fermented, at least 2 weeks.",
