    "des": "\"These grilled lamb chops are inspired by both Italian and Indian cooking. The yogurt-based marinade includes aromatic spices like cinnamon, oregano, and rosemary.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, lemon zest, chile paste, garlic, rosemary, oregano, salt, black pepper, and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Transfer into a resealable plastic bag. Add the lamb chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove lamb chops from from marinade and scrape off excess. Discard used marinade. Season chops with salt and black pepper. Place on the preheated grill and cook until browned and medium rare on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).",
