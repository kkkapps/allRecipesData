    "des": "\"This is a healthy alternative to potato chips and taste salty and sweet like sweet potato fries. This recipe is inspired by other recipes on the internet that I have played with. The thinner the slices, the crunchier the chips.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Put one rack on the highest level in the oven and another on the bottom.\nPeel carrots into thin strips using a vegetable peeler; put into a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the carrot strips and toss to coat. Season with salt; toss again. Spread carrots onto 2 baking sheets in a single layer, preventing overlap.\nPut one baking sheet on the top rack and the other on the bottom. Bake carrots in preheated oven for 6 minutes, switch racks, and continue baking until the carrots are crisp, about 6 minutes more. Cool chips until cool enough to handle before serving.",
