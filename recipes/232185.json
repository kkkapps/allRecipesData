    "ins": "Mix ground beef, rice, onion, and egg together in a bowl with your hands; shape into tennis-ball sized balls.\nStir tomato sauce and water together in a large pot; bring too a boil. Gently lie meatballs into the sauce, place cover on the pot, and reduce heat to medium-low.\nCook until meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nPut meatballs on a plate, cut each into halves, and ladle sauce over the meatballs to serve.",
