Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble into smaller pieces.\nCombine 3/4 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, onion, sour cream, mayonnaise, and most of the chives in a large bowl. Stir in potatoes and crumbled bacon. Garnish with remaining 1/4 cup Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and chives.\nRefrigerate salad before serving, 4 hours to overnight.",
