    "des": "\"This recipe makes a great complement to any meal. Potatoes are grilled in foil with cheese and bacon bits. This dish tastes great the next day when warmed up. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate.\nUse either a 9x13 inch grill-safe baking dish OR a piece of foil large enough to hold all the ingredients. Layer with the potatoes, onions, pats of margarine, salt and ground black pepper. Sprinkle top with imitation bacon bits. Cover with foil and make sure you seal tightly so the margarine does not escape.\nGrill over medium high heat for 45 to 60 minutes, or to desired doneness. Carefully open, arrange the cheese over all and allow a few minutes for the cheese to melt. Remove from grill and serve immediately.",
