    "des": "\"This is an adaptation to an all-natural bar that is very popular, naturally yummie, and very versatile.  It tastes like you are eating a candy bar but there is NO Sugar Added -- it's nature's candy!!  You don't need sugar because it's already sweet! Quick and easy, great for snacking, a grab and go bar!! Kid-friendly too!! Raw and no baking, no cooking required!!\"",
    "ins": "Place the dates, peanut butter, coconut, cocoa powder and salt into a food processor. Cover, and blend until smooth, about 4 minutes. The mixture will be very sticky.\nPress the mixture into a loaf pan lined with waxed paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove the chilled mixture from the pan and slice into 6 bars. Wrap each bar in foil and refrigerate until serving.",
