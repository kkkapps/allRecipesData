    "des": "\"This olive oil based rub is great on chicken or pork, particularly when using an indirect grilling method. You can also use this on potatoes. To coat potatoes, cut small baking potatoes into eighths and par boil for about 5 minutes. Coat with mixture and place directly on medium high grill rack, turning every five minutes, for about fifteen minutes, until tender.\"",
