    "des": "\"My family loves this spaghetti sauce. I know once you view the ingredients you will say, 'Chicken bouillon and chicken seasoning?' Yup! Trust me, you will enjoy this recipe. The secret to making spaghetti sauce is to let it simmer. When finished you can either serve with spaghetti or add to ground beef for meat sauce. You can also let this cool off and refrigerate it in containers for future use.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Mix in onion and garlic, and cook 1 minute. Stir in the green bell pepper. Season with basil, oregano, and chicken bouillon. Stir in the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes, and season with poultry seasoning. Cook and stir 10 minutes.\nMix sugar into the sauce. (Some people add up to 2 tablespoons sugar; I suggest starting with 1 teaspoon.) Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 3 to 4 hours.",
