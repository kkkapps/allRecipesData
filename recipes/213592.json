    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the orzo, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water in a colander set in the sink.\nWhisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, cider vinegar, Dijon and yellow mustard, chives, sugar, black pepper, and salt in a bowl.\nPlace the cooked and cooled pasta, ham, red onion, green pepper, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Toss together with the dressing. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.",
