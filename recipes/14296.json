    "des": "\"This refreshing fruit salad recipe with a wonderful twist comes from Hawaii.  It's a conversation piece as well...great for parties and potlucks.  The Almond Ice will have everyone guessing why these 'ice cubes' don't melt!!  Hint: Avoid citrus fruits so the gelatin remains firm.\"",

Mix well.\nPour gelatin mixture into a 9x13 inch pan and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Cut into 1 inch squares and serve in a bowl with cut fruits.",
