    "des": "\"The closest I've been able to come in recreating one of my favorites! The salad will be fairly greasy, but that is how it is in the restaurant version as well. It just doesn't taste nearly as good with only little dressing. I usually use about 3/4 of the dressing, but you may use less or more. Enjoy!\"",

Refrigerate salad dressing for at least 1 hour or overnight for best flavor.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat and grease the grate.\nToss salad greens, romaine lettuce, mango, peanuts, cucumber, and chow mein noodles in a salad bowl.\nSprinkle tuna with salt and black pepper.\nGrill tuna on the preheated grill until the outside is seared and brown and the inside is still red, about 1 1/2 minutes per side for rare. Slice the grilled tuna.\nTop salad with slices of avocado and grilled tuna; drizzle with salad dressing to taste.",
