    "des": "\"This is a super filling and flavorful beer cheese soup that will keep you asking for seconds. Because of the dark stout beer, this soup takes on a great flavor that everyone will love - especially the kids. I like using elk sausage in place of the kielbasa.\"",
    "ins": "Bring potatoes, water, and beer to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in the sausage, green onions, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, mustard powder, and liquid smoke. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are completely tender, about 15 minutes.\nWhen the potatoes are tender, stir in the Cheddar cheese until completely melted, then add the milk. Heat through, stirring until cheese has melted but do not boil.",
