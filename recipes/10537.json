Shape all of the dough into 1 inch balls.\nBake cookies on ungreased cookie sheets, 2 inches apart at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 20 minutes.\nLet cool 10 minutes then carefully lift with spatula to cake racks to cool.  Store in air tight container with wax paper between layers.  Cookies keep well.\nVariations:  Flatten some balls with tines of fork  and press 1/4 of a red or green glace cherry in center of each.   Make thumbprint indentation in some  balls and fill with a tiny bit of jam,  jelly or marmalade.  Dip some balls in slightly beaten egg   white and roll in finely chopped  walnuts.  Bake as they are or make an  indentation in top and spoon in a little jam or marmalade.  Dip some balls in egg white and roll  in desiccated coconut.  Bake as they  are or make an indentation and spoon  in a little jam, jelly or marmalade.",
