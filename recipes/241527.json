    "des": "\"While trying many of the grain free pancake ideas out there, I discovered that many pancake recipes are just too 'eggy' or include bananas in the recipe. A lot of the recipes resulted in pancakes that were too flat and broke apart when flipping. I wanted a recipe that was like the Aunt Jemima\u00c2\u00ae pancakes I grew up with: delicious and fluffy. After much experimentation with recipes and reading forum comments, I finally put together something reminiscent of childhood quality pancakes. Top with maple syrup and fresh fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat a lightly oiled griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nWhisk almond flour, chocolate chips, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk egg, egg white, honey, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture, adding enough water to reach a pancake batter consistency.\nDrop batter by large spoonfuls onto the prepared griddle and cook until pancakes are golden brown and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
