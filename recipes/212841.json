    "des": "\"My Aunt Julie and I were making Christmas cookies and we tried to make cake-mix cookies with brownie mix.  This is the result which we named by combining our names. Our families ate them all before Christmas! They should be soft, chewy and crinkly.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the brownie mix, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up the dough.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the confectioners' sugar in a shallow bowl.\nScoop up about 1 tablespoon of dough per cookie, and roll into a ball. Roll the ball in the confectioners' sugar, then place the balls on the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart.\nBake the cookies in the preheated oven until the tops are cracked, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing the cookies to racks to finish cooling.",
