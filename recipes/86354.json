    "des": "\"A bit of Polish mixed with an old Filipino favorite. A terrific way to use up left-over rice. Definitely a favorite at my apartment! Be sure to use rice that is cooked the previous day. Fresh rice will ruin this recipe and make it mushy. Add more veggies for variety.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onions; cook until soft and translucent. Stir in carrots, cabbage, and garlic; cook until garlic begins to brown. Stir in kielbasa; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes\nCrumble rice with hands to break up clumps. Then stir rice into skillet. Heat through, then stir in soy sauce. Beat 1 egg, and mix thoroughly into rice. One at a time, beat and stir the remaining 2 eggs into the rice. Cover, reduce the heat to medium low, and cook 10 minutes, stirring often.",
