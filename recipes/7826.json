    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 inch tube pan.\nSeparate the eggs. In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, beat the butter with the sugar until thoroughly creamed. Beat in the egg yolks, then the jam, vanilla extract, and dark rum.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder.  Beat the flour mixture into the creamed mixture, then stir in the nuts. Stir about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten it and then fold in the rest gently but thoroughly.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 65 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool. Makes about 12 servings.",
