    "des": "\"In a recent trip to San Francisco, my brother and I frequented a restaurant in the Haight district for breakfast. The inspiration for this came from that trip. Very simple. Use as a side, a topping (for eggs and omelets) or an ingredient. It's great with Egg Beaters\u00c2\u00ae omelets. Hope you enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Spray a medium-sized nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium heat and stir in onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.\nThinly slice sausage and then chop it into 1/4-inch cubes. Stir sausage into skillet with onions.\nStir tomato into sausage mixture and adjust heat to medium-high. Stir in chile pepper, if using. Mix in hot sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have broken down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.\nRemove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve warm.",
