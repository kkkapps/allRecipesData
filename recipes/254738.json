    "des": "\"A variation from overnight oats recipe from Alli Shircliff. This is for anyone who doesn't/can't eat oatmeal but wants a delicious, fast, and healthy breakfast. This uses buckwheat flakes--not the cereal flakes but rolled and flaked buckwheat. They look very similar to oatmeal flakes but are much smaller. Mix in agave and berries. Eat and enjoy!\"",
