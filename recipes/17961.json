    "ins": "Boil chicken breasts for 20 minutes or until they are thoroughly cooked. Drain breasts well and let cool. Use an electric food processor or manually shred the chicken and set aside.\nUse an electric food processor or blender to puree the olives. In a mixing bowl, combine salsa, olives, and chicken. Heat tortillas in microwave for about 20 to 30 seconds.\nPlace 1 to 2 tablespoons of the chicken mixture into the center of each warmed tortilla and roll the tortillas tightly, using toothpicks to keep them closed.\nHeat oil in skillet over a high heat. When the oil is hot, place the rolled taco into the oil and deep fry until lightly browned.  Drain on paper towels and serve.",
