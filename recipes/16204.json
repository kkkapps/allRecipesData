    "ins": "Butterfly each pork chop by slicing horizontally through the center with a sharp knife. Leave them attached on one side so they can be flipped open to create a butterfly shape.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add pork chops, reduce heat to medium and cook slowly for 5 to 7 minutes each side, or until they are done to your liking. Set aside.\nMelt butter or margarine in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add apples and saute until tender, then turn off heat and add cheese to skillet. Mix together slowly to form a creamy thick sauce.\nPlace reserved chops on serving plate and stuff each one with 1/4 of the apple/cheese mixture. Serve hot.",
