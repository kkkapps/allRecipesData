    "des": "\"I tried this salad in Rehoboth Beach, DE and vowed to duplicate it! It is so addicting with the crunchy sugared walnuts and creamy goat cheese. The vinaigrette is to die for. I don't even care for beets! Great for holiday dinners. A must try!\"",
    "ins": "In small saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir the walnuts and sugar until walnuts are lightly browned and sugar is caramelized. Thoroughly coat the walnuts with the sugar.\nIn a blender or food processor, blend the beets with cider vinegar, bouillon granules, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper. Gradually blend in the oil.\nIn a large bowl, toss together the sugar-coated walnuts and spinach. Before serving, drizzle with the blended beat mixture, toss, and sprinkle with goat cheese.",
