    "des": "\"A cheese sauce that goes well with Peruvian/Latin American foods. I learned the recipe from an elderly Peruvian woman! Especially good with Peruvian 'Lomos Saltado,' or as a topping for baked potatoes and hard-boiled eggs. If you want it spicier, leave a few of the seeds with the peppers.\"",
    "ins": "Blend aji peppers, evaporated milk, saltine crackers, queso fresco cheese, and salt in a blender until thick and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. For a thicker sauce, add 1 or 2 more crackers if desired.",
