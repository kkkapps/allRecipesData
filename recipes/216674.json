Add the broccoli, cover, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on thickness. Drain broccoli and place into a serving dish.\nIn a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter; stir in bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, and cook until the crumbs are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the browned crumbs onto the steamed broccoli, and toss gently. Sprinkle the broccoli with chopped egg.",
