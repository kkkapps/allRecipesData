Beat in the egg, 1/3 cup peanut butter and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Finally, mix in the rolled oats. Spread the dough evenly into the prepared pan.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are firm. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the chocolate chips in a single layer over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes, then spread to cover. Allow to cool. In a small bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup peanut butter until smooth. Stir in milk one tablespoon at a time until a drizzling consistency is reached.
