    "des": "\"The nutty smell of the sesame oil permeates the kitchen as these burgers are frying. While not authentically Asian, the taste distinctly hints at the flavors of the East. I created this recipe when I accidentally thawed out ground beef instead of chicken breast. Naturally, burgers were the quickest and easiest option. Serve in burger buns topped with teriyaki sauce Sriracha\u00c2\u00ae sauce as condiments.\"",
    "ins": "Knead together the sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic powder, ground ginger, onion powder, pepper, ground beef, green onion, and water chestnuts in a bowl until evenly combined; form into four patties.\nHeat the peanut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook in the skillet until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
