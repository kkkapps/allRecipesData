Chop into small pieces.\nRemove thick stems from kale. Chop leaves into thin, ribbon-like pieces. Place in a large bowl, pour in balsamic vinaigrette, and toss until evenly coated. Add eggs, bacon, Muscat grapes, parsley, salt, and pepper; toss well. Add 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds and Parmesan cheese; toss well.",
