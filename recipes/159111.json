    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with paper liners.\nSift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, then beat in the bananas and rum extract.  Stir in the flour mixture. Fold in the shredded coconut and pineapple; mixing just enough to evenly distribute. Evenly divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.",
