    "des": "\"Now for something completely different, how about a little Caribbean/Creole feel? This can be done with fish or with scallops and will wake up the little taste buds. Please forgive me, I am not a real recipe follower, and I change it around all the time. Hope this works for you, love to hear about it. I never wrote it as a recipe, sort of a seat of the pants guy. One item to complete it that I may add is Zatarain's Caribbean Rice\u00c2\u00ae,  and in this I add 1/2 red bell pepper and 1/4 cup of fresh pineapple.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together the paprika, curry powder, cumin, allspice, ginger, coriander, salt, black pepper, fennel, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; set the spice mix aside.\nIn a bowl, lightly toss the mango, pineapple, red bell pepper, black beans, red onion, and cilantro in a bowl; pour lime juice over the mango mixture, and toss again. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.\nWhisk together the egg and milk in a bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, stir the panko crumbs with coconut. Stir about 1 tablespoon of the spice mix, or to taste, into the panko crumb mixture.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip tilapia fillets into the egg mixture, then press gently into the panko crumb mixture to coat both sides of fillets. Brush off any loose crumbs, then lay the fillets into the hot oil. Pan-fry until the fish is opaque inside and golden brown outside, 3 to 5 minutes per side or as needed. Serve with mango salsa.",
