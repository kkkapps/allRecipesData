    "ins": "Cook rice according to package directions. Allow to cool until comfortable to handle.\nStir in one egg, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and black pepper. Mix until well blended.\nPlace flour in a small bowl. Beat 2 eggs in a second bowl. Place bread crumbs in a third bowl.\nDivide rice mixture into 24 equal portions about the size of a golf ball. Roll each portion into a ball.  Roll rice ball in flour. Place on baking sheet lined with parchment paper. (Mix will be sticky.)\nDip each rice ball into the egg wash. Dredge in bread crumbs, and place rice balls back on baking sheet. Refrigerate 15 minutes.\nGive each rice ball another quick roll in your hands to tighten up and smooth out the surface.\nHeat oil to 375 degrees F in a large sauce pan.\nCook rice balls in the hot oil in batches, about 4 per batch. Gently stir with spoon. Cook until rice balls are golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.\nDrain on paper-towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Salt lightly.\nServe hot with heated marinara sauce.",
