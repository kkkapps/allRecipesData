    "des": "\"Pomegranate juice makes an excellent marinade for chicken. Its sweet, tart flavor works really well, especially with Middle Eastern spices.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the cumin, coriander, herbes de Provence, black pepper, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl. Place the chicken and garlic in a bowl; sprinkle about 2/3 of the spice mixture over the chicken and toss to coat. Transfer the chicken to a resealable plastic bag. Pour in the pomegranate juice. Seal and refrigerate at least 12 hours. Remove the chicken from the bag, reserving the marinade.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPat chicken dry with a paper towel. Season with the remaining spice mixture and salt. Coat with olive oil, then arrange the chicken in a large baking dish in one layer.\nBake the drumsticks until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nWhile the chicken is baking, bring the reserved marinade to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering until reduced by 2/3. Stir often. Pour over chicken before serving.",
