    "des": "\"A unique, delicious fruit salad. It is always a hit and can be served year round, from Easter to Thanksgiving. It also goes great on angel food cake! The marshmallows soak up the juice and flavor and are so good! You can add seasonal fruit you have on hand! I usually chill in the fridge 30 min before serving to let the marshmallows soak up the juice!\"",
