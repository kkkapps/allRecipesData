    "des": "\"I wanted something like the traditional beef stroganoff and threw this one together, writing down everything as I went so I wouldn't forget.  I served with noodles, but rice would be great, too. Asparagus for a vegetable and a green or fruit salad is great!  Nutmeg seems to be the secret ingredient of many Stroganoff recipes.\"",
    "ins": "In a shallow dish or bowl, season flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour to coat. In a large skillet, brown coated chicken in melted butter or margarine until golden.\nIn a medium bowl combine the soup, half-and-half, dry onion soup mix, parsley, garlic, mushrooms, nutmeg and browning sauce. Mix all together and pour mixture over chicken in skillet. Reduce heat to low and let simmer, covered, for 1 hour.\nStir in sour cream and heat through, but DO NOT BOIL! Top with chopped green onion and serve over noodles or rice, if desired.",
