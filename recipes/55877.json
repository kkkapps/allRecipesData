    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a bowl, stir together the oil, brewer's yeast, oregano, chives, marjoram, coriander, and salt until well mixed. Add cubed tempeh, and toss to coat. (More oil may be needed to coat tempeh completely.) Spread tempeh in a single layer onto a lightly oiled cookie sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve warm, and enjoy!",
