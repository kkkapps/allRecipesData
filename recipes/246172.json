    "des": "\"Most Bulgogi recipes call for crushed pear. This is for tenderizing the meat. My boyfriend's Korean mother says Coca-Cola\u00c2\u00ae can also be used for the same purpose. This recipe uses very thin-sliced meat so tenderization isn't necessary. Sugar is used instead.\"",
    "ins": "Combine yellow onion, white and light green parts of green onions, soy sauce, sugar, sesame seeds, garlic, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl until marinade is well mixed. Add steak slices to marinade; cover and refrigerate, 1 hour to 1 day.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, cook and stir steak and marinade together in the hot skillet, adding honey to caramelize the steak, until steak is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish bulgogi with green parts of green onions.",
