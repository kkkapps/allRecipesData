    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish with lid.\nPlace the flour in a shallow dish.

Transfer to a plate and set aside.\nUsing the same skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Stir in the onion, green pepper, garlic, and bay leaves; stir and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Combine the rice with the pepper mixture; stir and cook until the rice turns opaque, about 3 minutes. Stir in the thyme, salt, chili powder, white and black peppers, red pepper flakes, wine, tomatoes, and chicken broth. Add the sausages; increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Transfer the rice mixture to the large pot and cover.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.\nRemove pot from the oven. Stir in the shrimp, pineapple, mango, and apple; blending thoroughly with the rice mixture. Cover and bake until shrimp is cooked, 10 to 15 minutes.",
