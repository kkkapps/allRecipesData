    "des": "\"Oatmeal is a great way to start a day! I have it almost every morning, so to not get bored I add different toppings and vary the ingredients I put in, always healthy and always delicious! Greek yogurt goes fantastically with hot oats and makes it creamier, adds protein, and most important of all makes a standard bowl of oatmeal phenomenal! Sprinkle with some more cinnamon, if you desire.\"",
    "ins": "Combine oats, banana, cinnamon, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl; add water and stir. Cook in microwave until water is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir to evenly distribute cinnamon; let stand until slightly cooled, about 3 minutes.\nSpoon Greek yogurt, strawberry jam, and peanut butter over oatmeal; stir.",
