    "des": "\"Take the time to make up a batch of these authentic Texas baked beans the next time you have an outdoor cookout. They are sure to be a hit! These are great if you don't have a smoker, but if you have access to a good hickory or pecan fire, take advantage. For a real Texas experience, enjoy a bottle of Lone Star\u00c2\u00ae beer for yourself and one for the beans while you make them.\"",

Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until onion begins to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Add bacon, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir until bacon is browned, 7 to 10 minutes more.\nStir beer, barbeque sauce, brown sugar, and molasses together in a large bowl; add pinto beans and bacon mixture. Season with garlic salt and black pepper. Pour beans mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling and browned, about 45 minutes.",
