Add tomatoes and spinach; simmer until flavors blend, about 25 minutes. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Once the water is boiling, stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook until tortellini float to the top, 3 to 4 minutes; drain.\nMix tortellini into tomato mixture; simmer for 5 more minutes.",
