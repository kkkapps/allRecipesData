    "des": "\"My mom first made these ribs many years ago, and I added it to my recipe collection at that time. This recipe is some extra work, so over the years I have looked for a recipe that might be just as good, but not as much work. I have given up the search! These ribs have now become a family favorite and I conclude, they are worth the extra time!\"",

Pour pineapple juice into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Add ribs, 2 tablespoons hot sauce, and bay leaf. Pour in enough chicken broth to cover ribs. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until ribs are tender, 45 to 60 minutes.\nRemove skillet from heat and cool ribs in the cooking liquid until no longer steaming; discard cooking liquid.\nCombine plum sauce, tomato paste, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon hot sauce, red wine vinegar, lime juice, ginger, and 3 cloves minced garlic in a saucepan; bring to a boil.

Cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate ribs in the refrigerator for 2 hours to overnight. Reserve extra glaze in the refrigerator for basting.\nRemove ribs from refrigerator and bring to room temperature for 30 minutes.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nGrill ribs, basting occasionally with glaze, on the preheated grill until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, 15 to 20 minutes.",
