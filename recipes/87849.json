    "des": "\"This is one of my all-time favorite meals. What makes the clam sauce so flavorful is the chicken bouillon, Worcestershire sauce, and baby portobello mushrooms. I recommend having this with some garlic bread and a nice glass of red wine. A very satisfying meal.\"",
    "ins": "Warm olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and mushrooms; cook until mushrooms are tender. Stir in clam juice, chicken bouillon, parsley, basil, oregano, and Worcestershire sauce. Increase heat to high, and bring to a quick boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain and set aside.\nStir chopped clams and butter into the sauce; simmer 15 minutes more. Pour over cooked pasta to serve.",
