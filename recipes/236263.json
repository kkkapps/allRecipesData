    "des": "\"This was a very good basic pancake recipe, but I wanted to add a little something to make them healthier and give them some substance. I also substituted the oil with applesauce! They came out great and all 3 of my kids loved them! The recipe made 20 pancakes; you can halve it if you do not need that many. I freeze the extras for another day!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk almond milk, applesauce, eggs, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to almond milk mixture and stir until batter is just moistened. Stir granola and almonds into batter.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
