    "des": "\"Not satisfied with many of the egg drop soup recipes I have come across here and elsewhere, I decided to try coming up with my own. It's not the prettiest looking soup around, but it is closer in taste and substance to what I was looking for. I may add some sweet corn next time I make it to add a little sweetness to it.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 3 1/4 cups chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add carrots, ginger, and white parts of green onion; bring soup to a boil.\nWhisk remaining 3/4 cup broth and cornstarch together in a bowl until dissolved.\nStir cabbage and green parts of green onion into the soup. Drop beaten egg, a spoonful at a time, into soup, stirring after each addition to prevent clumping. Stir cornstarch mixture into soup and season with salt and pepper. Stir soup until cornstarch thickens the soup, about 2 minutes.",
