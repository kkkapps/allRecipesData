    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nMelt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet over medium heat. Saute apples until medium-firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup white sugar and pinch of salt. Cook until apples begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Remove apples from the skillet and allow to cool. Wipe out skillet with a paper towel.\nPlace 1/2 cup of butter in skillet over medium heat. Constantly swirl the butter in the pan, watching carefully so butter does not burn. The butter is \"browned\" when it is a tan color and smells nutty. This can take 3 to 10 minutes. When butter is ready, promptly pour it into a bowl to prevent it from burning.\nAdd 1/2 cup white sugar to the apples and stir until sugar is well incorporated.\nIn a mixing bowl, combine browned butter, powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon until well combined. Add apple mixture and stir until well-blended.\nUnroll the pie crust on a silicone mat. Using a small cookie cutter, press out the pie crust \"chips.\" Lift the pie crust up, leaving the \"chips\" on the mat. Place the mat on a baking sheet. The remaining dough may be rolled out to 1/4\" thick and the process repeated to use up all the dough and make more \"chips\" using separate silicone mats (or parchment).\nBake in preheated oven, bake 6-7 minutes, watching carefully to ensure the chips to not burn. Allow the chips to cool. Place on serving plate.\nSpoon the dip into a serving bowl; serve with chips for dipping.",
