    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the shell pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nPreheat  oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.\nLightly mix together the cooked shell pasta, tuna, cottage cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, olives, artichoke hearts, green onion, white wine, and Cheddar cheese in the prepared casserole dish. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 45 minutes; remove cover and bake until browned, about 15 more minutes.",
