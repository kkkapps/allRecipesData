Lightly grease a 6 cup large muffin pan.\nIn a bowl, whisk together the rice flour, steel cut oats, flax seed, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and arrowroot powder.

Spoon evenly into the prepared muffin tin cups.\nBake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.",
