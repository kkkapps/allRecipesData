Place blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins.\nCombine Hatch chile peppers, ranch dressing, sour cream, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, lime juice, and salt in a blender; puree. Refrigerate until flavors are intensified, at least 1 hour.",
