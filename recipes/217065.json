    "des": "\"A yummy, kid-approved banana bread that will satisfy! Also adaptable with substitutions to make vegan. I recommend using all natural, organic, and local ingredients if possible. This makes 1 loaf, 2 cake pans, or 2 dozen muffins.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Stir in eggs, maple syrup and mashed bananas until well blended. Add the banana mixture to the flour mixture; mix until batter is just moist. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. If using muffin or cupcake tins, bake for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.",
