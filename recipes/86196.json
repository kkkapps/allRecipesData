    "ins": "Sift the flour into a medium bowl, and stir in the sugar. Make a well in the center, and add the egg. Stir with a wooden spoon while gradually pouring in the milk until you reach the consistency that you prefer. Thicker pikelets will need a thick batter, while thin pikelets will need a thin batter. Stir in melted butter last, beating until smooth.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Drop by large spoonfuls onto the hot skillet. Pikelets should be about 2 inches across. Flip when bubbles appear on the surface, and cook until browned on the other side.",
