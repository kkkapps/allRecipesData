    "des": "\"This is an excellent pasta salad that is great to make for the week ahead or to bring to potlucks!  Make it -- you won't be disappointed.  You may frown at the coleslaw dressing, but trust me, it's amazing in this recipe!  This recipe is highly requested when served.\"",
    "ins": "Cook the tortellini according to the package directions, drain, rinse with cold water, and refrigerate until cool, about 30 minutes.\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Chop the bacon into 1/2-inch pieces while still a little warm.\nPlace the tortellini, bacon, broccoli, grape tomatoes, and green onions into a salad bowl. Pour the dressing over the ingredients, and toss lightly to coat. Chill in refrigerator before serving.",
