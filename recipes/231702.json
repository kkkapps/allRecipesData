    "des": "\"You don't need the broiler to make great salmon fillets. A hot oven can produce tender, moist, flaky meat every time. This recipe uses lots of lemon juice and black pepper.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together lemon juice and black pepper in small bowl. Add mayonnaise, miso paste, Dijon mustard, and cayenne pepper to lemon-pepper mixture; whisk together.\nSpread the lemon-pepper mixture over salmon fillets. Reserve about a tablespoon for later use.\nCover salmon with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.\nPlace fillets on the prepared baking sheet. Spread remaining lemon-pepper mixture on fillets without letting it pool around base. Sprinkle with a pinch more black pepper and a generous amount of sea salt.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.",
