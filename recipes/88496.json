    "des": "\"This is one of my favorite dishes to make whenever I have some zucchini on hand. Some people tell me that it doesn't look so good, but once you try it, I think you'll like it. The mixture of vegetables, eggs, peppers and tomato sauce gives it color, besides some protein. You might like the taste better than the looks of it. Give it a shot, it won't kill yah!!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini; cook and stir until soft. Add the onion and bell pepper, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Make a clearing in the center of the skillet and pour in the eggs. Cook and stir to scramble. When the eggs are cooked, stir in the tomato sauce until everything is coated. Serve warm.",
