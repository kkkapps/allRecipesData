    "des": "\"I'm not a big fan of bruschetta, but I love this recipe, and so does everyone I've made it for! This is just as good as anything from a restaurant. This recipe takes longer the first few times you do it, before you really get the hang of it. It is a bit of work, but trust me, it's worth it! Most likely, you won't have leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nBrush both sides of each baguette slice with extra-virgin olive oil. Arrange baguette slices on a baking sheet and toast under the broiler, about 1 minute per side; watch carefully to avoid burning. Remove toasted slices and set aside on baking sheet.\nPlace red pepper halves, cut sides down, on a baking sheet; broil until skin is charred and blistered, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer pepper halves to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let peppers cool and strip off and discard blackened skin. Chop the roasted peppers.\nMix chopped roasted red pepper, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives, green onion, pesto, 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic together in a bowl. Top each bread slice with about 1 tablespoon of the mixture and sprinkle each appetizer lightly with Parmesan cheese.\nPlace bruschetta on baking sheet under broiler just until the topping is lightly browned and bubbly, about 1 to 2 minutes.",
