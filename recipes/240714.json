    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet set over medium-high heat. Season the pork with 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) each salt and pepper. Add to the skillet and brown all over; transfer to a bowl.\nReduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, carrot, apple, rosemary and remaining salt and pepper; cook, stirring often, until tender. Whisk the cider with the broth, mustard and cornstarch. Stir into the skillet. Bring to a boil and reduce the heat to medium-low. Return the pork to the skillet. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until cooked through. Stir in the spinach and vinegar; remove from the heat.\nMeanwhile, prepare the noodles according to package directions. Arrange the noodles in a serving dish. Spoon the pork mixture over to serve.",
