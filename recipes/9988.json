    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease and flour baking sheets.\nMelt butter in medium saucepan. Add rest of ingredients and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture starts to bubble.\nRemove from heat and stir briskly for a few strokes. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls about 4 inches apart on well-greased and floured baking sheet.\nBake only 5-6 cookies at a time. Bake for about 5-6 minutes until golden brown.\nCool wafers for 2 minutes on baking sheet. Remove carefully with spatula and place over rolling pin, glass, or mug so they curl and become firm. If cookies harden before they can be removed from cookie sheet, reheat in oven again a few seconds to soften.\nNote:  Do one test to check oven temp and quantity of batter. The bigger the cookie, the more fragile. Use 1/2 tsp for test.",
