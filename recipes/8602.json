    "des": "\"This recipe was from my sister, Paula, who lived in northern England with her English husband.  Indian food and 'takeaways' are very popular there.  I serve this dish with rice and a spinach salad with tomato wedges, hard boiled eggs, cucumber slices, feta cheese and black olives. Doubling the marinade will provide plenty of sauce to go over the rice.\"",
    "ins": "Make cuts in the chicken flesh, almost to the bone. Pour 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice over the chicken and rub in the salt.\nCombine the tandoori spice, yogurt, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oil and the vinegar. Coat the chicken with the mixture, rubbing well into the cuts. Place the chicken in a 13x9 inch pan, cover with foil and refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake covered chicken at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour. Remove foil the last 15 minutes of baking.",
