    "des": "\"The rich and nutty flavor of chestnut flour makes a deliciously unique waffle. Light in texture but hearty in flavor, this is a perfect treat for those cool autumn mornings. Chestnut flour has a smoky flavor that hints of molasses. When you taste these hot waffles topped with maple syrup you'll think Mother Nature arranged this marriage!\"",
