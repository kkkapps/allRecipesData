    "des": "\"These bars are full of crunchy seeds, wheat germ, and rolled oats for fiber, and protein. Since they keep in the freezer for months, I love to grab them straight from the freezer and pack them for snacks on the ski hill.\"",

Lightly grease a 9x14 inch ovenproof baking dish.\nMix the rolled oats, brown sugar, wheat germ, cinnamon, and flour together in a large bowl.

Use your hands to mix the ingredients, and press the mixture into the prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
