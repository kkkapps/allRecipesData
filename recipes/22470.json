    "des": "\"My sister gave me this recipe.  It is so decadently rich and wonderful and especially nice toasted and spread with a little salty butter, or even cream cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition.  In a separate bowl, stir together flour, baking powder, nutmeg, allspice and salt. Blend the flour mixture into the butter and egg mixture a bit at a time, beating well after each addition.. Stir in the banana and vanilla; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven for 90 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
