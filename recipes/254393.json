    "des": "\"Traditional shrimp ceviche is made by 'cooking' raw shrimp in the acid of citrus juice, like lime or grapefruit. In this coastal take on the classic recipe, the shrimp are instead gently cooked in boiling water and cooled before bathing in a creamy marinade of coconut milk. The result: a recipe so easy and refreshing that it will transport you to a breezy beach-side caf\u00c3\u00a9 after one silky bite.\"",
    "ins": "Fill large pot halfway with water; add Adobo. Bring water to boil over high heat, stir in shrimp and turn off heat. Allow the shrimp to sit in hot water until pink and opaque to center, 1-2 minutes. Drain, transfer shrimp to baking sheet. Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in large, non-metallic bowl, stir together coconut milk, lemon juice, hot sauce and Sazon; season to taste with Adobo. Stir in red bell pepper, red onion, jalapeno, garlic and chopped cilantro. Add cooled shrimp to coconut mixture; stir to completely cover and submerge shrimp in liquid. Cover bowl and transfer to refrigerator. Chill at least 30 minutes, up to about 24 hours, before serving.\nTo serve, spoon shrimp and coconut mixture into small bowls. Garnish with cilantro leaves.",
