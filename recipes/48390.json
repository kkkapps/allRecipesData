    "des": "\"I had a moose roast sitting in my freezer for a couple of months, because I had no idea how to cook it, not being a wild game fan.  A friend suggested this method of cooking it and it was delicious.  I made it at Christmas along with the turkey, thinking my guests could have a taste and I wouldn't have to feel guilty about it being in my freezer anymore, but it was the hit of the dinner!\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides in the hot oil. Remove, and transfer to a slow cooker.\nSprinkle onion soup mix over the roast, then pour in the apple juice. Cover and cook on MEDIUM for 6 to 8 hours, or until meat is very tender. Check occasionally to make sure there is sufficient liquid, and add more juice if necessary. Serve roast with juices, or thicken them for a tasty gravy.",
