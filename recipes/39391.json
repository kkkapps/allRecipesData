    "des": "\"Bubble tea is very popular, especially to Asians, but now, more and more people from different backgrounds like the taste of it.  I'm no expert at this, but I do know how to make it.  It's simple but some of the ingredients may be a little tough to find.  Just be patient and look for them in Chinese grocery stores.  It is worth the trouble!\"",
    "ins": "In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups water to a boil. Stir in 1 teaspoon sugar until it dissolves. Toss in the pearl tapioca.  Cook for about 20  minutes.  Rinse, drain, and refrigerate until chilled.\nPour tea, milk, and 4 teaspoons sugar into a cocktail shaker.  Stir until the sugar has dissolved and the milk is well mixed in.  Add the ice cubes, and shake so the whole drink can get cold.  Pour into a glass, and add tapioca.",
