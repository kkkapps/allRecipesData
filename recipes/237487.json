    "ins": "Put flour, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper into a large, sealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake to mix. Add beef cubes to the bag, seal again, and shake to coat beef in the flour mixture.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook beef in hot oil until completely browned on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Mix onion with the beef cubes; cook and stir until the onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPour the tomato juice into the skillet; add mushrooms and stir. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and simmer the mixture until the beef is completely tender, about 1 hour.\nStir sour cream into the beef mixture until the sauce is smooth and even in color; add lemon juice and stir.",
