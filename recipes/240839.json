We love hot peppers and always make a lot of these from the ones we grow in our garden every year.\"",

Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.\nBlend cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and taco seasoning together in a bowl; spread into jalapeno halves and arrange onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle bread crumbs over the cheese filling.\nBake until the peppers are just tender, 20 to 30 minutes.",
