Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.\nPour the vegetable and broth mixture into the container of a blender, and add 1/4 cup of the lobster meat. Cover, and process until smooth. Return to the saucepan, and stir in the half-and-half, white wine, and remaining lobster meat.  Cook over low heat, stirring frequently until thickened, about 30 minutes.",
