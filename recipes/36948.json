    "des": "\"This is the most moist, fabulous tasting meatloaf--everyone loves it!  The Hoisin sauce is available in the Oriental Food Section of the grocery store... it is like cross between soy and ketchup, and makes a wonderful glaze for this moist meatloaf.  We love this dish.  Very moist.  Serve with rice and steamed broccoli.  A wonderful dinner.  Leftovers make great sandwiches.\"",
