    "des": "\"This is a variation on a recipe from Ontario Turkey. We like our version much better. The difference is poultry seasoning, no wine, and starting with cooked leftover turkey. We usually make a double batch and it never lasts very long.\"",

Stir chicken stock, mushrooms, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper into turkey mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk cream into soup.",
