    "ins": "In a skillet over medium heat, brown the sausage. Remove sausage from skillet and set aside. Add margarine, zucchini, and onion to the skillet and cook until zucchini is crisp and tender. Return the browned sausage to the skillet and add garlic salt, oregano, and black pepper. Cook until all ingredients are hot. Add chopped tomatoes on top of the ingredients.",
