    "des": "\"Did a lot of research on jambalaya and reviewed a number of recipes and came up with the following. I like white fish and, while not traditional, added chunks of cod fillet to this dish. You want to add the shrimp and fish to the dish with about 10 minutes to go so it does not overcook. Cook uncovered if it is soupy and covered if it is not during these last 10 minutes. Finally, try to find andouille sausage if possible. It makes all the difference.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Cook andouille sausage in the melted butter until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel.\nCook and stir onion, celery, and green bell pepper in the butter remaining in the pot until the onion becomes translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.\nStir garlic into the onion mixture; cook and stir together for 1 minute.\nStir tomato paste through the vegetable mixture; cook and stir another 3 to 5 minutes.\nReturn andouille sausage to the pot along with diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, and black pepper; stir to combine.\nPour chicken broth over the sausage mixture; bring to a boil.\nStir rice into the mixture, place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook undisturbed until the rice is tender, 25 to 30 minutes.\nAdd shrimp and cod to the rice mixture. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the mixture comes to a boil; reduce heat again to medium-low and cook uncovered another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nSeason with salt and fold parsley into the jambalaya to serve.",
