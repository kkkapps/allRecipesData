    "ins": "Place potato cubes into a food processor, and process until the potatoes are finely shredded, and some of the starch has been incorporated. Sprinkle with salt, and form the potato mixture into balls the size of a quarter. The starch will hold them together.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Drop the balls carefully into the hot oil, and cook until golden brown. Remove from deep-fryer to drain on paper towels.",
