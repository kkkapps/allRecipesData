    "ins": "Dredge the beef heart in flour until coated. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Fry the pieces of heart until browned. Stir in onions and water. Season with salt and seasoning salt. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender. Serve over noodles or mashed potatoes.",
