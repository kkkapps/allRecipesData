Grease a 9 inch tube pan and one 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nSift the flour, sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves into a large bowl. Stir in the applesauce and oil, then mix in the raisins, dates, mixed fruit and 2 cups of walnuts. Pour into the prepared pans. Pans should be about 3/4 full if using mini pans, or an assortment.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the crown of the cake comes out clean.",
