    "des": "\"This is very spicy and full of flavor. I first tried this dish in a Korean restaurant. The red pepper flavor is the same that is used to make kimchi. After playing with the recipe, I discovered a flavor that my Korean boyfriend loves. You can also pour the sauce over lettuce to create a version of the Korean salad some restaurants serve.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sesame seeds, and cook until they turn golden brown and begin to pop, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and place into a large bowl.\nWhisk the kochujang, vinegar, sesame oil, and green onion into the toasted sesame seeds. Stir in the sliced cucumber until well coated with the dressing. Serve either chilled or at room temperature.",
