    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch tube pan.\nSeparate the egg yolks from the whites and keep the egg whites cold.\nCombine milk, 1 1/2  cups of the sugar, 1 cup of the butter and all of the chocolate and bring to a boil in the top half of a double boiler over medium heat.  Let cool slightly and stir in the egg yolks, flour, and  baking powder.  Beat for about 2 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.\nIn a glass or metal bowl beat the egg whites until stiff.  Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture.  Pour batter into a greased 10 inch tube pan.\nBake for 50 minutes at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Let cake cool in pan for 15 minutes then turn out on to a wire rack to finish cooling.\nTo Make Frosting: Melt 1 cup sugar in a heavy pan.  Once melted and slightly amber colored add the finely chopped nuts.  Pour into a buttered flat sheet pan to cool.  Once cool and set crush to a powder using a food processor.\nCream 1/2 cup of the butter until light and fluffy,  gradually mix in the nut powder and the confectioners' sugar beating until smooth and creamy.
