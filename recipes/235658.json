    "des": "\"This is a refreshing, light dish that can be used as a main protein for a summer meal or as an appetizer for a dinner with guests. If you have trouble finding langostinos you can always substitute shrimp. This is a gluten-free and dairy-free dish, so can be good when you are dealing with potential food allergies.\"",
    "ins": "Combine langostinos, red bell pepper, rosemary, sea salt, red pepper flakes, white wine, and balsamic vinegar, in respective order, in a large bowl. Toss until langostinos are evenly coated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, 4 hours to overnight.",
