    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, and cook while stirring to crumble until no longer pink. Stir in the chilies, garlic, peanut butter, lime juice, coconut cream and fish sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the mint, and serve warm or hot. Garnish with a few leaves of mint.",
