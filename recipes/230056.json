    "des": "\"I made this recipe for my mother's birthday over 20 years ago. Everyone loved the Brussels sprouts! Then I lost the recipe. Recently as I was going through my mother's recipe cards, I found the copy I made for her. I had forgotten what an attractive dish this is. It is as good as I remember and best of all, it still gets rave reviews!\"",
