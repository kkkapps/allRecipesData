    "des": "\"This salad is so easy to make you won't believe how good it tastes! I usually serve it with sandwiches and an ice-cold drink for a light, warm-weather meal. The soft, crisp green of the cucumber complements the brilliant whites and reds of the radishes, making a very pretty, creamy salad.\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, toss together the cucumbers, onion, and radishes. In a separate bowl, mix the mayonnaise and Ranch dressing. Season with salt and pepper. Mix into the vegetables. Chill in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before serving.",
