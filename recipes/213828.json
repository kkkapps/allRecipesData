    "des": "\"My grandma made this every weekend to go with her traditional big Irish breakfast.  It's cooked on an electric griddle and cut into toast-sized slices that can be eaten buttered, toasted, or fried crisp in the bacon drippings. Serve with butter and jam or fry insides down on hot pan with bacon drippings for a minute until golden and crispy.  Unfried pieces can be toasted on the second day, but won't keep longer then that.\n\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an electric griddle or fry pan to medium-high, about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl until well combined.\nStir in the buttermilk, 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture forms a very sticky ball of dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and knead gently 8 to 10 times. Pat the dough into a circle about 1 1/2 inch thick, and cut the circle into quarters.\nPlace the wedges onto the preheated griddle and cook until the bottom is golden brown, about 15 minutes; turn over and cook the other side until golden, another 10 to 15 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a wedge should come out clean. Stand the wedges on a wire rack to cool, then cut each wedge in half and slice horizontally for serving.",
