Beat in the egg and vanilla.\nSift together dry ingredients and add to creamy mixture.\nShape dough into balls, using a rounded teaspoon for each ball.  Roll balls in sugar and place on a greased cookie sheet.\nBake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Top each cookie with a candy kiss, pressing down firmly so cookie cracks around edges.\nPut back into oven for 2 to 5 minutes longer, until golden brown.",
