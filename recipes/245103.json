Place chicken in the pan; brown on each side, about 6 minutes total.\nPour 1/2 cup Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth and lemon juice into the skillet. Cover and simmer chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken and set aside; keep warm.\nWhisk 2 tablespoons cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth together; add to the liquid in the pan. Increase heat to medium-high and stir frequently until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes.  Sprinkle chicken with dill. Serve sauce with chicken.",
