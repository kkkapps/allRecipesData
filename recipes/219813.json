    "des": "\"On my way to a Hawaiian-themed party, all I could think of was Pineapple Upside Down Cake. The recipes did not seem Hawaiian enough. The additions of coconut, banana and macadamia nuts brought the tropics to the recipe. I can't tell you how many people raved at the party. The whole cake is gone.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour the melted butter into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nSprinkle the brown sugar evenly over the butter.\nArrange 8 pineapple rings in two rows in the baking dish.\nSprinkle the macadamia nuts, half of the flaked coconut, and 2 chopped pineapple slices between the rows of pineapple rings.\nPlace a maraschino cherry in each pineapple ring, then scatter the remaining cherries over the coconut mixture. Set baking dish aside.\nWhisk together the pineapple juice, coconut water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl. Stir in the mashed banana, yellow cake mix, and remaining flaked coconut until well blended.\nSlowly pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then run a paring knife between the cake and the edge of the pan.\nCover the cake pan with a large serving plate, and invert it to tip the cake out of the pan and onto the plate with the pineapple slices showing.",
