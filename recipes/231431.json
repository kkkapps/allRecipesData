    "des": "\"I've been making this granola for more than a year. I often get requests for the recipe. It's loaded with a variety of nuts and flavored with cinnamon and vanilla. An excellent choice for topping yogurt or ice cream. I prefer 'extra-thick'-style rolled oats.\"",

Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.\nStir rolled oats, oat bran, wheat germ, shredded coconut, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds, and slivered almonds together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.\nMix kosher salt and cinnamon together in a saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and add vegetable oil and coconut oil.
