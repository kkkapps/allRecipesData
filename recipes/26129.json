    "ins": "In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough into 1 inch balls and roll the balls in the remaining sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 9 minutes in the preheated oven, or until just barely golden. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
