    "ins": "In a small bowl, pour rum over raisins. Let stand for 30 minutes and drain.\nPlace ingredients in pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer.  Use the regular setting for a 1 pound loaf.\nIf your machine has a Fruit setting, add the raisins at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.",
