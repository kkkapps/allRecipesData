    "des": "\"My mother says this is the original chocolate chip cookie recipe passed down from my grandmother.  For bars just press the dough into a jelly roll pan and bake.  This recipe makes a very small batch.  I triple the recipe and use 1/2 cup margarine and 1 cup shortening instead of all shortening.  It seems to make a softer cookie.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, cream together shortening, brown sugar and white sugar. Mix in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter until moistened. Mix in the walnuts and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are light brown.",
