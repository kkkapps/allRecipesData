    "des": "\"Family favorite around bird hunting season. Chicken fried pheasant is so simple and good, and unless you tell them, they don't have a clue it's wild game. Uses few ingredients, prep and cooking time are minimal. The first problem is getting the bird in the first place, if you're a hunter! The second problem is there are NEVER any leftovers, no matter how much you cook. Makes wonderful cold sandwiches IF there is anything leftover!\"",
    "ins": "In a shallow bowl, mix the milk and vinegar. Dip the pheasant slices in the milk and vinegar mixture, then press both side in the cracker crumbs to coat.\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the pheasant in the hot oil about 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.",
