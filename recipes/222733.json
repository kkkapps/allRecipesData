    "des": "\"This is a fruit salad my mother-in-law makes, and it is just wonderful and probably the best I have ever had. If you don't like a particular fruit, just substitute it with one that you like! Sometimes my mother-in-law uses peeled and chopped pear in this recipe, you can use pomegranate seeds, mandarin oranges...just whatever seasonal fruit is available to you, it's a very forgiving recipe and completely full of vitamins.\"",
    "ins": "Mix grapefruit, orange, apples, pineapple, maraschino cherries, and grapes in a large bowl. Mash slightly with the back of a wooden spoon to release juices. Add bananas, coconut, walnuts, and sugar; stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate to blend flavors, at least 1 hour.",
