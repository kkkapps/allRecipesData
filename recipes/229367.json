    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nMix bread crumbs, olive oil, garlic, ground mustard, savory, black pepper, and rosemary in a bowl; spread mixture over beef chuck roast. Transfer roast to a shallow roasting pan.\nBake in preheated oven until beef begins to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Allow roast to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\nStir sour cream, horseradish, lemon juice, and salt in another bowl. Serve with sliced beef.",
