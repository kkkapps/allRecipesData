Brush a baking dish lightly with olive oil.\nMix bread crumbs, capers, parsley, and garlic together in a bowl.\nSprinkle some of the bread crumb mixture into the bottom of the baking dish.

Repeat layers with remaining anchovies, olive oil, and bread crumb mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until top is crispy and lightly browned, about 20 minutes.",
