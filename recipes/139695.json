    "des": "\"Amish cooking is amazingly simple and incredibly delicious.  This 'funny' pie flips its chocolate and cake layers during the baking process.  The result will make you flip! Leftovers can be kept for up to one week in the refrigerator.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBeat together 1 cup sugar, cocoa powder, hot water, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract with an electric mixer on medium speed until the sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Pour this batter into the pie shells.\nSift together the flour and baking powder; set aside. Cream together 1 cup sugar with the butter. Beat in the vanilla, then the eggs, one at a time. Slowly beat in half of the milk, then half of the flour until moistened. Mix in the remaining milk then flour. Carefully spoon this batter on top of the chocolate batter, making sure that the entire top of the cake is covered with no chocolate visible.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool for at least 1 hour before serving.",
