    "des": "\"A sweet, and wonderfully moist cake, using fresh rhubarb, with optional coconut and almonds! This cake disappears fast at our house and was adapted from a recipe that came from my mother in law.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a small bowl, mix chopped rhubarb with 1/2 cup sugar; set aside. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream together 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Fold in the rhubarb mixture. Stir in the coconut and chopped almonds. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nTo make streusel topping:  In a small bowl, combine 4 tablespoons flour and 4 tablespoons brown sugar. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle on top of cake.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.",
