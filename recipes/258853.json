Sort of a cross between cake and brownies, it has a lovely chewiness. Lovely hot out of the oven alone or with ice cream, or when cool topped with whipped cream.\"",

Add cake mix; stir to create a thick batter. Spread into the prepared baking pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.",
