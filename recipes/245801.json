    "des": "\"This is a thick, spicy, tangy, sweet, savory Asian sauce, super quick and easy. Perfect as a dipping sauce and marinade. \nI usually make my own since I have problems with MSG that are normally found in most prepared store-bought sauces. This is a versatile sauce for finger foods and appetizers, for marinating pork, chicken, beef, tofu, and vegetables, as an addition to barbeque sauces, or to complete dishes like mu shu pork, onion pancakes, pot stickers, and dim sum.\"",
