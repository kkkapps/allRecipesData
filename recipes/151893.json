    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Set slow cooker on Medium, add the sliced onions and cover.\nPlace the ribs on a baking sheet, season with salt and ground black pepper, and place under the preheated broiler until brown, about 5 minutes. Place the browned ribs into the preheated slow cooker with the onion. Cover and cook for 4 hours.\nAfter 4 hours, pour the entire bottle of barbeque sauce over the ribs and onions, pour water into the barbeque sauce bottle, shake and pour into the slow cooker to prevent sticking. Stir gently to combine the water and barbeque sauce. Cover and cook until tender, about another 4 hours.",
