    "ins": "Bring a pot of water to a simmer over low heat. Add the chicken breast to the water and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the water and allow to cool before shredding the meat into a large bowl.\nWhile the chicken cooks, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the macaroni at a boil until cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cool water to halt the cooking process until the pasta is cool to the touch. Add to the bowl with the chicken.\nStir the pineapple, apple, celery, carrot, and raisins to the bowl; toss to combine. Add the mayonnaise, sugar, and seasoned salt; gently stir the mixture until evenly coated. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.",
