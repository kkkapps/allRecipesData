    "ins": "Combine the bread flour, whole wheat flour, ground cinnamon, mace, powdered milk, salt, cranberries, and pineapple. Add this mixture as you would normally add dry ingredients to your bread machine.\nAdd all the ingredients to the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer.\nSet your bread machine to Basic Loaf, and check to see that the dough forms a ball without excess moisture.  May have to add a little more bread flour, no more than a tablespoon, so that the dough forms a nice solid ball.",
