    "des": "\"This version of knefla is a tasty, easy German-Russian staple for dinner, comprised simply of dough and potatoes. Sometimes I add 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon to the boiling water for extra flavor. Serve with sausage, brats, or alone. Some like it with sauerkraut or breadcrumbs for garnish.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Whisk together the egg and milk in a separate bowl; stir in the flour mixture until a smooth dough is formed.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, cut the dough into bite sized pieces with scissors into the boiling water. Boil for 20 minutes; drain well.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; add the knefla and potatoes. Stirring occasionally, cook until the potatoes are tender and the knefla are golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
