    "des": "\"I found a recipe for sour milk waffles in an old cookbook, and I modified it to make sourdough waffles. If you do not have a sourdough starter, substitute sour milk or buttermilk. I also changed the bacon drippings to applesauce to make this healthier. These come out of the waffle iron looking amazing - crispy on the outside and tangy and tender on the inside, and they smell like baking bread while cooking. Eat with lots of syrup if you prefer a sweeter waffle, as there is very little sweetener in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Grease and preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.\nMix sourdough starter and eggs in a bowl. Mix in flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Stir applesauce into the batter; mix well to combine.\nPour 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the batter onto the preheated waffle iron. Bake until golden brown according to manufacturer's instructions, about 3 minutes.",
