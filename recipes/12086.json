    "des": "\"My ex-mother-in-law used to make this for me.  It's not a milk custard type, and it's not like a regular rhubarb pie.  It's just fantastic! Fresh or frozen rhubarb may be used.\"",
    "ins": "Beat egg yolks to a thick froth. Gradually beat in the sugar, flour, and melted butter or margarine. If using fresh rhubarb, use 3 tablespoons flour; if using frozen rhubarb, only use 2 tablespoons. Stir in rhubarb pieces.\nDump rhubarb mixture into an unbaked, chilled pie shell. Cover filling with top crust. Flute and vent the pie.\nBake on bottom rack of oven at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cool somewhat before cutting.",
