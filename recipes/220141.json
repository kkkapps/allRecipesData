    "des": "\"These gluten-free, lactose-free crepes are not only made 100% with buckwheat, but they use wholesome raw buckwheat groats instead of buckwheat flour, which often has a very strong flavor when not fresh. Soaking the groats before using them develops a lovely texture and a delicious, soft nutty taste. After blending you end up with a smooth batter. These crepes do not crisp up and become golden but they are very pliable and go great with maple syrup, berries, jam, and mashed bananas as filling.\"",
    "ins": "Combine buckwheat groats with about 1 1/3 cup water in a bowl; allow to soak, draining and rinsing once or twice during soaking, 4 hours to overnight.\nRinse and drain groats one final time. Transfer drained groats to a blender with egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and 1/2 cup water; blend into a smooth batter. Blend more water into the mixture as needed to reach a smooth, spreadable texture.\nLightly grease a skillet and place over medium heat.\nPour about 1/3 cup batter into the skillet; lift and tilt the skillet to swirl the batter evenly over the skillet; return to heat.\nCook for about 2 minutes. Gently flip the crepe and cook the other side until the crepe is firm in the middle, about 2 minutes more; flip again and cook about 12 seconds. Plate and serve immediately.",
