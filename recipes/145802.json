    "des": "\"Being an enthusiastic Philadelphia Eagles football fan, I wanted to create a burger recipe that had a taste of Philly, and some green ingredients, as a tribute to the Birds. If you like cheeseburgers, melt your favorite cheese, and eat! We love to load ours onto potato rolls and add lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles. As my sister says, 'Don't forget the bacon!'\"",

Mix lightly using your hands, then form into 8 patties.\nLightly brush the grill grate with oil and place patties on the grill. Cook until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done.",
