Carefully fit into two 10 inch tart pans.\nBlind bake tart shells in preheated oven until golden brown.  Let cool.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.\nSaute onion in butter until translucent.  Divide ham, bacon and onion into two equal portions and sprinkle over the bottom of tart shells.\nWhisk together cream and beaten eggs. Add salt, pepper, nutmeg, basil, and thyme, and stir well.
