    "des": "\"Super easy, delicious and reheats well! This (loosely inspired by German potato salad) recipe is tasty hot or cold and great for outdoor dining - no mayo to worry about keeping cold. Also, you can switch it up and play with different flavor combinations by swapping the vinegar, herbs, and spices. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nWhisk olive oil, 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, honey, paprika, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir potatoes, mushrooms, and sweet onion into vinegar mixture; toss to coat. Spread vegetables over prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble bacon.\nTransfer potato mixture to a large bowl and toss with bacon, green onions, parsley, and remaining 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar.",
