    "des": "\"This is a really basic way to roast peppers for use in any recipe. Choose any color peppers you like, or use a variety of colors for a beautiful presentation.  After they are roasted you can add an oil and balsamic dressing, or fry in olive oil and garlic to serve with crusty bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).\nCut the peppers into quarters.  Remove the seeds and the membranes.  Roast the peppers until the skin blisters and turns black.  Remove from oven and cover with plastic, or a tea towel, or place in a paper bag until cool.  The skins should peel away off of the peppers easily when cooled.",
