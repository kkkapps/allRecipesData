    "ins": "Position one rack in the top and another in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir together the flour, baking soda and salt until thoroughly blended.\nIn a medium size bowl, beat the butter for 30 seconds at medium speed until creamy.  Add the sugars and continue beating for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the mixture is light in texture and color.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Beat in the vanilla.\nAt low speed, beat in the flour mixture a third at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in all of the chocolate chips, bittersweet chocolate and white chocolate.  Stir in pecans and toffee bits.  The dough will be very stiff.\nDrop the dough by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls onto 2 ungreased baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between the cookies.  Refrigerate the remaining dough.  Bake the cookies for 11 to 13 minutes, or until the cookies are set and the edges are lightly browned; switch the positions of the baking sheets halfway through baking time for even browning.\nCool the cookies on the baking sheets on wire racks for 1 to 3 minutes.  Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.  Repeat with the remaining dough.",
