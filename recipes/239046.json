Transfer roast to an oven bag and put into a 13x9-inch casserole dish.\nWhisk beef consomme, water, onion soup mix, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl; pour into the oven bag over the roast. Cut 6 small slits in the top of the oven bag for ventilation.\nBake roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour 45 minutes; add carrots, onion, and mushrooms to the oven bag and bake until vegetables are tender and roast is cooked through, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
