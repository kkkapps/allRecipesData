    "des": "\"Growing up my mother always made egg custard for a treat. I came across this high-protein, healthier version (her version used white sugar) years ago and I've been making it ever since. You can add a variety of things, such as shredded coconut or chopped nuts, to give it a different flavor. I also change extracts, such as almond or maple, for even more options.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir dry milk, honey, and vanilla together in a bowl; beat in eggs. Whisk milk into egg mixture until custard batter is well-blended. Divide custard batter between 4 custard cups and sprinkle each with nutmeg. Place custard cups in a shallow pan filled with hot water.\nBake in the preheated oven until set, about 40 minutes. Chill completely before serving.",
