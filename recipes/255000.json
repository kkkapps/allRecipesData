This recipe has minimal ingredients and is super easy. You can season some pieces more heavily than others depending on everyone's taste.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour wine into a glass baking dish. Arrange amberjack fillets on top. Coat with a very thin layer of mayonnaise. Sprinkle seafood seasoning over mayonnaise coating.\nBake in the preheated oven until amberjack flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes.",
