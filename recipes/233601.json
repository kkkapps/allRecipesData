    "ins": "Soak water chestnuts in a bowl with soy sauce for at least 3 hours; drain.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWrap each water chestnut with a piece of bacon; secure with a toothpick and arrange on a shallow baking dish. Repeat with remaining water chestnuts.\nBake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, 25 to 35 minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix brown sugar, mayonnaise, and chili sauce in a bowl until dipping sauce is smooth. Serve bacon-wrapped water chestnuts with dipping sauce.",
