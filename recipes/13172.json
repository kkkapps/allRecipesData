    "des": "\"This is the most popular of Greek soups. The name means 'egg and lemon', the two most important ingredients that produce this light and nourishing soup.  Orzo is a Greek rice-shaped pasta, but you can use any small shape. Garnish with fresh lemon slices.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the chicken broth into a large saucepan, and bring it to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 5 minutes.\nBeat the eggs until frothy, then add the lemon juice and 1 tablespoons of cold water. Slowly stir in a ladleful of the hot chicken stock, then add one or two more. Be careful not to scramble the eggs!\nReturn this mixture to the pan, off the heat, and stir well. Season with salt and pepper and serve at once, garnished with lemon slices. Do not let the soup boil once the eggs have been added or it will curdle!",
