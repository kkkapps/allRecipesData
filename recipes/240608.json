Decided to make my own from scratch being I learned how to do things like this while getting my chef certification. Baste onto ham roughly every 10 to 20 minutes for at least the last hour of cooking time. For a more encrusted glaze, start basting the ham sooner.\"",
    "ins": "Stir brown sugar, lemon-lime soda, orange liqueur, cloves, allspice, salt, and black pepper together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until glaze is reduced by 1/4, about 10 minutes.\nStrain through a fine-mesh sieve into another saucepan. Bring mixture to a simmer again and cook until glaze is about the consistency of maple syrup, about 10 minutes more.",
