    "des": "\"My aunt and I made up this recipe when looking for recipes to use our homemade limoncello. It sounds like a lot of flavors going on, but it tastes so good!! Mint syrup is basically simple syrup made with mint tea instead of water. You can substitute ginger beer for the ginger ale. Ginger ale is a lighter flavor versus ginger beer, which makes it more spicy.\"",
    "ins": "Pour vodka, cranberry juice, mint syrup, lemon juice, and limoncello into a shaker. Fill the shaker with ice, cover, and shake until chilled. Pour chilled cocktail into two glasses and top each with a splash of ginger ale.",
