    "des": "\"A wonderful milkshake that can easily be adapted for low-sugar diets. My mother got me started on this 20 years ago.  I rarely add sugar or sweetener, but I realize that some people enjoy a bit more sweetness. You can substitute orange juice for milk if you like.\"",
    "ins": "In a blender combine milk, frozen strawberries, 1/2 banana, chocolate milk powder, vanilla and sugar. Blend until smooth. If consistency is too runny, you may add more strawberries.",
