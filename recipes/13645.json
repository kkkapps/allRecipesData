    "des": "\"This is a great stuffing that has just enough sweet and the right touch of sour.  Guaranteed to be a favorite at your next holiday get together. This makes enough to stuff one 12 to 14 pound turkey. Chicken or vegetable broth can be used for this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCook onion in butter or margarine over low heat until soft. Add cranberries, brown sugar, rosemary and sage, orange juice, salt and pepper to taste. Mix gently but thoroughly.\nIf baking stuffing separately, spoon into buttered 3 or 4 quart casserole, drizzle with broth, dot with butter.  Bake for 30 minutes.  Uncover and bake an additional 30 minutes.",
