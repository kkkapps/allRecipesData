Ever since, I've been experimenting with different ingredients and finally found a mixture that is OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you like pumpkin pie, you will LOVE this delicious beverage recipe.\"",

Moisten the rim of 1 chilled martini glass and dip the moistened glass into the graham cracker; set aside.\nPour the pumpkin pie filling, rum, maple liqueur, and half and half into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the prepared glass, and garnish with whipped cream to serve.",
