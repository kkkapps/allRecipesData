    "des": "\"Lentil soup is a favorite in the Middle East.  It is often the first dish used to break the day of fasting during Ramadan.  My husband loves it anytime of year, especially on cold days.  Serve with grissini, or garlic croutons.  Can be reheated, but may need to be thinned with heavy cream or water. Garnish with fresh parsley.\"",
    "ins": "Place lentils into a  pressure cooker, and cover with about 1 inch of water.  Add onion and oil, cook for 10 minutes and then turn off heat and let set for 10 minutes.\nPlace lentil mixture, cumin, and pepper into a food processor or blender and puree until smooth.\nTransfer pureed soup into a large stock pot and return to heat.  Right as soup is ready to boil add onion soup mix, stirring until well mixed.  Simmer until soup has a thick creamy consistency.\nPrior to serving add lemon juice and chopped parsley for a little flavor and garnish.",
