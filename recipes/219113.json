    "des": "\"This recipe is very adaptable as far as what and how much you add to the basic dough. I used a normal amount of chips, but this amount can be doubled without issue. You can also toss in dried fruit and nuts fearlessly.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicon mat or parchment paper.\nMash the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large mixing bowl with a spatula until creamy and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla; whisk vigorously for 20 to 30 seconds.\nWhisk the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a small bowl; dump into the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Fold the semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and milk chocolate chips into the mixture. Arrange onto the prepared baking sheet using a small scoop or large spoon.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes; remove from oven and allow to cool on the sheet for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.",
