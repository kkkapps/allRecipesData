    "des": "\"This tastes just like real Italian gelato, but low-fat. And using condensed milk, no one will ever know! You can use any of your favorite berries for this recipe. My favorite is raspberry. Also tastes great with a ripe banana mixed in. Or try something exotic and tropical such as kiwi and mango with coconut extract.\"",
    "ins": "Blend berries and sugar together in a food processor or blender until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl if needed. Transfer berry mixture to a bowl.\nBeat sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy; fold into berry mixture. Pour mixture into a shallow pan and freeze for 1 hour; stir and return to freezer, 8 hours to overnight.\nRemove from freezer and let stand 10 to 15 minutes before serving.",
