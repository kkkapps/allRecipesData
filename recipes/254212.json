    "des": "\"Buckwheat groats and Italian black chickpeas are tossed with a light basil and mint pesto, before being topped with spicy Thai chiles for a nice and spicy vegetarian meal. The basil and mint along with the spicy chiles has a flavor that I find blends very well with cold milk. The texture of the salad also is a great mix with milk.\"",
    "ins": "Bring the water to boil in a medium saucepan. Add the salt and rinsed buckwheat groats. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until the groats have almost tripled in size, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes.\nLightly pound mint leaves, basil leaves, and raw cashews with a pestle in a mortar until they begin to release their own oils. Churn the pestle to create a chunky paste. Add a bit of oil if necessary. The texture should be chunky, not too smooth.\nFluff the groats with a fork. Drain off any excess water. Transfer the buckwheat to a large salad bowl. Add the chickpeas and drizzle with a bit of oil, mixing well. Add pesto and mix well, drizzling more oil if necessary. Add the chiles and coriander. Mix well. Serve warm or cold. Best served with ice-cold milk.",
