Add celery, bell pepper, and onion; saute for about 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.\nStir in condensed soups and canned tomatoes. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes. The mixture will look very thick and curdled at first, but will become smooth with cooking.  Do not add water.\nAdd the crawfish; cook for about five minutes more.  Serve.",
