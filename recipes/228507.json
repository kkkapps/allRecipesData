May substitute 2 sticks of cinnamon, removed at end of cook time. Increase or reduce amount of tapioca flour for desired consistency.\"",
    "ins": "Stir raspberries, cherries, cane juice, and cinnamon together in a saucepan over medium-heat; bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan, and continue cooking until the berries are tender and juicy, about 15 minutes.\nRemove the saucepan from heat. Stir port wine through the berry mixture; gradually add tapioca flour, while stirring, until dissolved completely into the compote.",
