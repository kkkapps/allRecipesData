    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread coconut out on a baking sheet. Line a separate baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBake coconut in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until golden and toasted, about 7 minutes.\nBlend dates and almonds together in a food processor until smooth; add cocoa powder and process until completely incorporated. Transfer date mixture to a bowl.\nFold 1 cup toasted coconut, cocoa nibs, agave nectar, vanilla extract, and salt into date mixture until truffle dough is evenly mixed. Roll dough into tablespoon-size balls.\nPour remaining toasted coconut into a shallow bowl. Roll truffle balls in toasted coconut to coat; place coated truffles on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate truffles until hardened, about 1 hour.",
