    "des": "\"This recipe is incredibly simple to make, and it's fat-free, yet these are the most delicious beans I've had. The secret ingredient is the salt-preserved lemon, a flavor like no other. Serve hot in small bowls as a side dish or snack. Good with eggs, tortillas, or other Mexican food. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator.\"",
    "ins": "Place kidney beans into a large container and cover with about 1 quart water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain.\nCombine beans, 1 quart water, preserved lemon, sugar, black pepper, red chile pepper, bay leaf, garlic powder, and anise seed in a stockpot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover stockpot, and simmer for 1 hour.\nRemove lemon, bay leaf, and red chile pepper from bean mixture. Mash about 10% of the beans against the sides of the stockpot using the back of a spoon. Cover stockpot and simmer for 45 minutes more.\nRemove cover from stockpot and simmer beans until beans are thickened and water is evaporated, about 15 minutes more.",
