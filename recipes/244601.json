    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCut peaches in half and remove peach stones. Cut each half in half again.\nWrap prosciutto around each peach section; secure with small bamboo skewers.\nGrill peaches, turning often, until prosciutto gets a little crisp around the edges and the peaches begin to caramelize, about 6 minutes.\nTo serve, spoon burrata onto serving plates. Remove peaches from skewers; place several of the grilled peaches around the cheese. Drizzle with olive oil. Top with a sprinkle of sea salt and pepper; garnish with basil.",
