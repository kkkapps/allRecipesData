    "des": "\"This sauce has a delicate flavor of mushrooms that have been bathed in beer with a kiss of honey. Romantic hints of rosemary truly bring together this unique sauce that my husband and I invented for a chicken recipe. This will definitely compliment chicken or beef. Use local honey if possible.\"",
    "ins": "Melt unsalted butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallot, red onion, garlic, and mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms begin to give up their liquid, about 10 minutes.\nPour beer into skillet; simmer until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add rosemary sprigs and stir in Cajun seasoning. Simmer another 5 minutes. Stir in honey. Turn heat off and allow sauce to cool slightly before using.",
