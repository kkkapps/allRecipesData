Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute kale and garlic in the hot oil until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nStir quinoa into kale mixture and add sesame oil; cook until flavors blend, about 5 more minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water to mixture to keep from sticking.",
