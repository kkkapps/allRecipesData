    "des": "\"This delicious blueberry liquor is best with frozen blueberries rather than fresh due to the organic breakdown that occurs when fruit is frozen. This allows the berries to 'burst' into the vodka and please the taste-buds!\"",
    "ins": "Mash thawed blueberries with a fork in a bowl, then place into a 1-quart canning jar. Add the lemon zest, cloves, and vodka.\nSeal the jar tightly with its lid and place in a cool, dark place. Allow the vodka to stand for 3 months, shaking the jar gently every few days.\nAfter 3 months, strain out the blueberries, and filter the vodka through cheesecloth into another 1-quart jar. Pour in the simple syrup, seal the jar tightly with its lid, and shake until the syrup has dissolved.\nAgain place into a cool, dark place, and age for at least a month. When ready to bottle, filter again through cheesecloth, then pour into a decorative bottle of your choice.",
