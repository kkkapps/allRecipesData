    "des": "\"What's called \"jelly\" in America is called \"jam\" in England, and the English call the American's \"gelatin\", \"jelly\"!  But, any way you slice it -- spread some fruit preserves over cake, top with a gelled fruity confection, sweetened, stovetop-thickened milk, and whipped cream -- and you've got trifle!\"",
    "ins": "Slice cake and spread pieces with jelly or jam.  Sandwich pieces of cake together and arrange pieces in bottom of glass trifle bowl or other glass serving bowl.  Prepare the gelatin according to package directions and pour over cake.  Refrigerate until set, 2 hours.\nPour prepared pudding or custard over the set gelatin.  In a medium bowl, whip cream until stiff peaks form.  Spread over pudding.  Sprinkle with chocolate and chill in refrigerator until serving.",
