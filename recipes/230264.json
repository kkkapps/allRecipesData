The ingredient amounts can be altered according to the cook's desire to have a more or less chocolatey concoction. Different kinds of chocolate can be used also, like dark chocolate.\"",
    "ins": "Put the chocolate bar into a microwave-safe bowl and add the milk. Microwave until the chocolate is soft and melted, about 30 seconds. Stir Greek yogurt into the chocolate mixture until smooth.",
