    "ins": "Place a tortilla onto a work surface and spread about 2 tablespoons cream cheese evenly over the tortilla. Layer 3 slices of deli ham over half the tortilla, followed by about 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese, 3 or 4 cucumber slices, 2 or 3 lettuce leaves, a small sprinkle of bacon bits, and a pinch of southwest seasoning. Leave half the tortilla uncovered by fillings except the cream cheese.\nStarting from the layered half of the tortilla, tightly roll into a log and secure with toothpicks. Slice rolls into 1/2-inch thick slices to serve.",
