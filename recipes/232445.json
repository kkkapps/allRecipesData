    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPut pork chops into a roasting pan. Arrange potatoes, onions, and carrots around the chops. Sprinkle onion soup mix over the chops and vegetables; season with salt and black pepper. Pour beef broth over the entire mixture.\nPlace a cover on the roasting pan and bake in the preheated oven until the pork chops are no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
