    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSpread crushed onions in a shallow bowl. Pour beaten egg into a separate shallow bowl.\nDip chicken into beaten egg, then press into crushed onions. Gently tap chicken to let loose pieces fall away. Put breaded chicken to a baking sheet.\nBake chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
