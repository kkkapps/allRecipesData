    "des": "\"Mad dogs were my favorite kid food, and they're fun to make. Good quality hot dogs are slit open, stuffed with cheese, and wrapped with a slice of bacon. They're great with or without a bun, and you can try them with ketchup, mustard and onions. \"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nUsing a knife, make a slit along the entire length of the hot dog that's about 3/4 of the way through the hot dog. Break the cheese slice into 2 pieces and stuff each piece into the slit in the dog. Wrap the bacon slice around the hot dog in a spiral fashion, then secure all with a toothpick. Place on a cookie sheet or baking dish.\nBake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 11 to 15 minutes, or until bacon is crisp.",
