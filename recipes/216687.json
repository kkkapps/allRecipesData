Line several baking sheets with parchment paper.\nWhile wings are frying, mix the melted butter, hot sauce, bourbon, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and habanero sauce in a large plastic tub with a lid. Place the wings into the sauce, close the lid, and shake to coat wings with sauce.\nPlace the wings on the prepared baking sheets and bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is slightly sticky, about 10 minutes.",
