    "ins": "Preheat oven 325 degrees F. Wrap tortillas in Reynolds(R) Aluminum Foil and bake for 10 minutes or until soft. Arrange the tortillas to make a crust in a Reynolds(R) Bakeware Pie Pan, overlapping and trimming as needed, and making sure the edges stay below the top edges of the pan.\nCook onion and bacon in a large skillet until onion is tender and bacon is crisp. Drain on paper towels.\nWhisk together eggs, sour cream, and salt in a large bowl. Add onion mixture, corn, and cheese; mix well. Pour egg mixture into tortilla-lined pie pan.\nBake 35 to 45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. If necessary, cover edge of crust with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning.\nLet stand 10 minutes before serving.",
