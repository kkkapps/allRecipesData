Mix remaining egg, tuna, onion, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, parsley, celery salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a large bowl.\nStir 2 cups baking mix and cold water together to form a soft dough. Cover a cutting board with cheesecloth and lightly dust with flour. Turn dough out onto the prepared cutting board and knead 5 times. Roll into a 15x10-inch rectangle. Spread tuna mixture over the dough. Roll, beginning at one of the long side, into a cylinder; transfer to the prepared baking sheet with the sealed edge down. Shape the cylinder into a ring and pinch the ends together. With scissors, make cuts 2/3 of the way through ring at 1-inch intervals.
