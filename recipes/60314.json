    "des": "\"This is an unusual version of classic Middle Eastern gyros (only homemade under the oven's broiler). Very tasty and quick to make. Perfect weekday dinner! You can prepare it in advance, let it marinate and just stick it in the oven. Best served inside pita bread pockets, with salad and yogurt.\"",
    "ins": "Place the chicken strips side by side in a broiling pan. In a cup or small bowl, stir together the ketchup, olive oil, white wine vinegar, oregano, mustard powder and curry powder. Pour over the chicken. Allow the chicken to marinate while you preheat the oven's broiler.\nBroil uncovered for 15 minutes with the meat about 6 inches from the heat. Just until the chicken is cooked through, but not browned. If left too long, it will turn stringy and dry.\nPlace hot chicken into pita pockets and spoon some of the juices from the pan over it. Top with salad greens and plain yogurt.",
