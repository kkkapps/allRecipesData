    "des": "\"Deep-frying fresh basil in olive oil really brings out its flavor!  The chicken is simmered in white wine with thyme, bay leaves, and sweet grape tomatoes.  Garnish with fried basil and serve over rice to sop up every last bit of the flavorful juices.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook basil in oil until it begins to get crispy and has a strong basil smell; this will take several minutes. Scoop basil out of oil with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels.\nRemove half of the remaining oil from the pan. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper to taste, and brown in oil; this should take about 4 minutes per side. Stir in chicken broth, wine, and balsamic vinegar. Season with bay leaves and thyme. Cover, and simmer over low heat until chicken is done and sauce is reduced; this should take about 25 minutes.\nIn a small saucepan, combine water and rice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes.\nPlace halved tomatoes in the pan with the chicken, cover, and simmer until the tomatoes are warm.  Spoon chicken pieces, tomatoes, and sauce over rice, and garnish with fried basil.",
