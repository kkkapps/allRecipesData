    "ins": "Place milk, Egg Beaters, Fleischmann's, flour, sugar and salt in blender container. Blend until smooth to make crepe batter.\nSpray 10-inch nonstick skillet generously with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup batter in skillet; immediately tilt skillet to evenly cover bottom of skillet with batter. Cook 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until lightly browned, turning once. Remove crepe from skillet and place on flat work surface. Repeat with remaining batter to make 4 additional crepes.\nMeanwhile, spread warm crepe with 1/3 of the peanut butter. Place peanut butter-side up on large plate. Top with 1/4 of the banana slices. Spread second crepe with 1 tablespoon hazelnut spread; place spread-side up on top of bananas. Top with another 1/4 of banana slices. Repeat layers with 2 more crepes, another 1/3 of the peanut butter and remaining hazelnut spread and bananas. Spread remaining 1/3 of the peanut butter on the last crepe and place peanut butter-side down on top.\nCut into 6 slices with serrated knife. Serve with Reddi-wip.",
