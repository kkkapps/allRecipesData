    "des": "\"This recipe was a nice way to use up some extra pumpkin we had available. Served it to one person who really enjoys pumpkin (myself) and one who doesn't, and both came away really liking it! Has enough flavor that the pumpkin makes itself known, but not so much that it overpowers the alfredo flavor or texture. Recipe makes enough to toss with one cooked 12 oz. box of pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir sage leaves in hot butter until the butter takes on the sage flavor, about 5 minutes.\nWhisk cream, pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, and Parmesan cheese into the butter; cook until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.",
