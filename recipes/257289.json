    "des": "\"There is nothing better than a semolina dumpling soup made from beef stock. This is a German dish called\u00c2\u00a0Griessnockerlsuppe. Semolina dumplings are suitable for freezing, as is the stock. The boiled beef can be used for other dishes, such as marinated beef salad.\"",
    "ins": "Place beef bones and beef shank in a large pot; add cold water, onion, peppercorns, bay leaf, and salt. Bring to a boil; cook, skimming foam from the top, for 30 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer stock for 1 hour.\nStir parsnip, turnip, leek, carrot, and celery into the stock; cook for 1 hour more. Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve and return to the pot; season with salt and ground black pepper. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Remove the fat from the top of the stock.\nBring stock to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer.\nHeat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat; add butter and cook until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir semolina into milk mixture with a wooden spoon until mixture is smooth. Lightly beat eggs in a bowl and stir into semolina mixture until very smooth; season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat and let stand in a cool place for 30 minutes.\nShape semolina mixture into small dumplings using 2 spoons or wet hands. Drop dumplings into the simmering stock and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.",
