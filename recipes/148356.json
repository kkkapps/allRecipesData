    "ins": "Stir together the quinoa, 1/2 cup water, parsley, basil, and lemon zest in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Pour into a mixing bowl, fold in the Parmesan cheese, and allow the mixture to cool.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Lightly grease a small baking dish.\nSpoon a quarter of the quinoa mixture onto one end of each sole fillet. Fold the other side of the sole overtop, sprinkle with black pepper, and place a lemon slice on top. Place the sole into the prepared baking dish, and add the vinegar and remaining water.\nBroil in the preheated oven until the sole flakes easily with a fork, and the flesh is opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.",
