Stir occasionally to keep from burning.\nBake hen at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)  for about 1 hour or until bird is cooked through and juices run clear. Baste hen thoroughly with prepared glaze every 10 to 15 minutes while baking; when hen is cooked through and ready to serve, garnish with orange zest.",
