    "ins": "Mix together the seasoned bread crumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, and garlic salt in a shallow bowl. Beat the eggs in a second shallow bowl.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the oil is rippling, but not smoking.\nDip the zucchini slices into the beaten egg, then into the crumbs, and place in the skillet in a single layer. Fry the zucchini slices until golden brown, about 3 minutes, then flip them over and fry until the slices are cooked through and golden brown on the other side. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the slices, and cook the slices 1 to 2 more minutes to allow the cheese to melt.\nTo serve, spoon hot spaghetti sauce onto plates, and top with fried zucchini slices and melted cheese.",
