    "des": "\"Tangy and sweet old-fashioned baked beans with a little jalapeno. They're easy to make and great at a BBQ, hamburger night, a picnic, etc. My husband's favorite semi-homemade recipe. Says the sweetness and fire create a super depth of flavor. It's not strong enough to overwhelm the sweet home-style of baked beans.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat to render some fat, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir onion into the rendered fat and cook until the bacon is crisp and the onion is tender, 7 to 10 minutes.\nStir baked beans, ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, prepared mustard, minced jalapeno pepper, chili powder, and mustard powder together in a large bowl; add bacon mixture and stir. Pour the mixture into a 13x9-inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the liquid has thickened, 45 to 55 minutes.",
