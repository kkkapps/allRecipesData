    "des": "\"Even though I live in balmy south Florida, where it is pretty much summer year round, I still like to 'get into' the seasons by cooking something festive and seasonally appropriate.

Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with 1 teaspoon coconut oil.\nPlace 1/4 cup coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, about 30 seconds.\nMix flour, ground flaxseeds, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, and sea salt in a large bowl.\nCombine brown sugar, melted coconut oil, and egg in a separate large bowl; add squash puree, coconut milk, molasses, and vanilla extract and mix well. Stir flour mixture into squash mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before turning cake onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
