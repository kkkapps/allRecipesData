Remove skillet from heat; stir cheese through the mixture until melted evenly throughout.\nArrange crescent roll dough triangles atop the sausage mixture in a spiral pattern with points of dough toward the center, covering the sausage mixture completely.\nBake in preheated oven until crust is golden brown and meat mixture is hot and bubbly, about 12 minutes.",
