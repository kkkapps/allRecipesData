    "des": "\"This is an easy way to use up small amounts of leftover chicken, and no one fights over white or dark meat! It can serve as a good appetizer for unexpected guests, snack, junk food meal (we all do it) or tempter for a little picky eater. We fell in love with these at a Mexican restaurant; the flavors can vary depending on your family's taste - Italian, oriental, whatever!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace small amount of shredded chicken lengthwise along each won ton wrapper; roll up and seal by dampening edge of wrapper with a finger dipped in water. When you run out of chicken meat, place rolled won tons in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes or until wrapper is crisp.\nNOTE: These can also be frozen in a single layer, then placed in a storage bag and baked or deep fried as needed.",
