    "des": "\"Banana bread is one of those things people rarely make on purpose, only when those last three bananas are almost black. This scrumptious banana-walnut loaf, spiked with dark chocolate chips, is so good you'll want to make it well before the bananas get to that condition.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.\nWhisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.\nBeat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add mashed bananas and beat until combined. Beat eggs into the butter mixture one at a time, fully blending each egg before adding the next. Stir vanilla extract and milk into the mixture.\nStir chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, and flour mixture into banana mixture until just incorporated.\nPour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap pan on the counter to release any air pockets.\nBake in preheated oven for about 1 hour 10 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.\nLet the bread rest in the pan for 15-20 minutes; remove from pan, slice, and serve.",
