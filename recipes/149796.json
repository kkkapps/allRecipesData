Stir in the bulgur, salt, and pepper; simmer until water is completely absorbed, about 10 minutes; stir in the caramelized onions. Remove from heat, cover, and allow to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.\nDivide lentils into 4 even portions; squeeze one lime wedge over each portion and top with green onions and yogurt.",
