    "des": "\"This chicken can be spicy or mild but whichever way you choose it is definitely born in Texas! Add avocado, black olives or pico de gallo to the inside of the breasts for variation. For milder tastes, remove seeds from jalapenos.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLay the chicken breasts out flat and sprinkle with Ranch-style dressing mix. Sprinkle a bit of cheese onto each half of each breast. Place 2 tomato slices and a sliced jalapeno pepper onto each one, and sprinkle more cheese over the tomato and pepper. Fold each piece of chicken over, and wrap with 2 slices of bacon. Secure with toothpicks. Place wrapped chicken into a baking dish, and cover with aluminum foil.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.",
