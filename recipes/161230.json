    "des": "\"I first had this colorful salad at a tailgate before a Jimmy Buffett concert, thus the name!  It's perfect for spring and summer get-togethers when the ingredients are fresh and ripe.  My supper club likes it even better with Buffett playing in the background! Serve with poppy seed dressing.\"",
    "ins": "Toss the lettuce, strawberries, blueberries, mango, tomatoes, raisins, almonds, and onions together in a salad bowl. Cover, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to mingle. Do not refrigerate more than 4 hours.\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp and evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble and sprinkle over the salad to serve.",
