    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nBring a pot of water to a boil; cook tempeh in the boiling water to soften the flavor of the tempeh, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool tempeh.\nPlace bread in a food processor and pulse until evenly crumbled. Transfer bread to a large bowl. Crumble cooled tempeh over bread crumbs; add Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; mix well using your hands. Form tempeh mixture into 1-inch balls and arrange 'meatballs' on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; flip 'meatballs' and continue cooking until lightly browned, about 10 more minutes.",
