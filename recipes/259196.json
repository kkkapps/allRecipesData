    "des": "\"A nice, tender, creamy meatloaf! My husband is fairly picky, and he said it's the best meatloaf he's ever tasted! \nI originally based it on my mother's recipe, which called for cream of mushroom soup, but had to change it due to my mushroom allergy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a small roasting pan with cooking spray.\nCombine ground beef, 1/2 can chowder, onion, eggs, celery, bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl; mix until smooth. Mound meatloaf mixture in the prepared roasting pan. Cover pan with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.\nRemove from oven; pour remaining 1/2 can chowder over top and sides of meatloaf. Return uncovered pan to the hot oven; bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes more.",
