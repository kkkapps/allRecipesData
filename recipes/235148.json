    "des": "\"Angel food cake, Butterfinger\u00c2\u00ae candy bars and Cool Whip\u00c2\u00ae are the well known favorites in this delightful (and easy) no-bake dessert. Looks great in a trifle bowl. I don't even like Butterfinger\u00c2\u00ae bars and I thoroughly enjoy this stuff!! You can do this in a 9x13-inch pan as well, but the trifle looks so nice!\"",
    "ins": "Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a large bowl with an electric mixture until creamy. Fold whipped topping into the mixture.\nSpread 1/2 the angel food cake pieces on the bottom of a trifle dish. Pour 1/2 the whipped topping mixture in an even layer over the cake pieces. Sprinkle 1/2 the crushed candy bars over the top. Repeat layers with remaining cake, whipped topping mixture, and crushed candy. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.",
