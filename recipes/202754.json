    "ins": "Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in the chilled shortening and butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. (This can also be done in a food processor: pulse the cold shortening and butter until it's the size of small peas. Turn mixture into a bowl and proceed.) Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until the flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to three days. Roll one ball out to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate and chill for at least 20 minutes before baking. Roll out top crust and set aside.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDrain the great Northern beans, garbanzo beans, navy beans, black beans, black-eyed peas, lentils, pinto beans, and kidney beans and place in a food processor. Blend beans while slowly drizzling the olive oil into the mixture. Blend in the hummus. Pour the batter into a large mixing bowl and stir in the nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, cream of tartar, and vanilla extract. Pour the batter into the pie crust and smooth with a spatula. Place the second pie crust on top. Seal the edges using a fork.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
