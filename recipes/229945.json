    "des": "\"This turkey brine will impart incredible flavor to your bird and keep it moist no matter how long you cook it. The allspice berries give this recipe a unique and wonderful flavor, so depending on how much of this flavor you want, you can add more or less berries. Kosher salt is the best option for any brine, but if you don't have any on hand, substitute the 1 1/4 cup of kosher salt for 1 cup of table salt. I once used this to brine a turkey that took 7 hours to cook, and it was still one of the most moist and juicy turkeys I ever made. This recipe will make enough to cover up to a 17 pound turkey.\"",
    "ins": "Stir water, salt, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, thyme, rosemary, peppercorns, allspice berries, and bay leaf together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Set aside to cool completely before brining turkey.",
