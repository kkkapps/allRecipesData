    "des": "\"Searching for recipes for a gluten-free diet can be challenging during the holidays.  Here is a recipe for Irish soda bread that I have adapted over time for St. Patrick's Day.  The recipe calls for rice and tapioca flour instead of wheat and it still tastes yummy!  Good if wrapped and left overnight, but I think it tastes great right out of the oven. Serve with butter or jam.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9 inch round cake pan.\nCombine the rice flour, tapioca flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk together egg and buttermilk . Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet. Stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Pour into the cake pan.\nBake for 65 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack, for 10 minutes before removing from the pan.  Wrap bread in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and let stand overnight for the best flavor.",
