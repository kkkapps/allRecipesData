    "ins": "Spread the bread cubes out onto baking sheets or a work surface, and allow to dry for 24 to 48 hours (longer for a drier dressing).\nMelt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, garlic, and celery until the onions become translucent, about 8 minutes. Pour the vegetables and butter into a large bowl. Lightly mix in the bread cubes, and stir in the oysters and their liquid until thoroughly combined.",
