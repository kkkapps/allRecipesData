    "des": "\"A delicious Moroccan-inspired rack of lamb. I created this for my anniversary, and it was divine. Serve with honey-glazed carrots and rosemary mashed potatoes. Ras el hanout is a traditional and complex Moroccan spice blend, and may be found in specialty grocery stores.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSeason lamb with sea salt, and rub with ras el hanout. In a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat, sear lamb on all sides until evenly browned.\nPlace skillet with lamb in the preheated oven, and roast 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature has reached a minimum of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nRemove lamb from skillet, reserving juices, and allow to rest 10 to 15 minutes before slicing ribs. Place skillet with juices over medium heat, and stir in wine and honey. Cook until reduced by about half. Drizzle over ribs to serve.",
