Stir candy cane powder into melted white chocolate until well mixed, thick, and somewhat lumpy. Add food coloring until desired color is reached.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon mixture, about 2 teaspoons per mint, onto the baking sheet, about 1-inch apart. Cool to room temperature and store mints in a resealable bag.",
