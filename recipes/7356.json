    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, blend together the butter or margarine and the sugar.  Separate 3 of the eggs; add the yolks and the 2 remaining whole eggs to the butter mixture.  Stir in the vanilla and water.\nIn another bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour.  Add these dry ingredients to the creamed  mixture.\nWhip 3 egg whites until they are foamy.  Add 1 tablespoon sugar.  Continue to whip the whites until they are stiff, but not dry. Fold whipped whites into batter.\nPour the batter into a greased 10 x 4 inch tube pan.  Wrap a large coin in foil, and place the coin in the batter.  Press the coin down; it should be completely hidden.  Sprinkle the nuts and seeds on top of the batter.\nBake the cake for about 70 minutes, or until done.  Cool on a wire rack.",
