Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a small bowl.\nBeat sugar and cream cheese together until smooth; stir in cranberries, saskatoon berries, and eggs until well combined. Stir flour mixture into cream cheese mixture to make a silky batter; pour batter into prepared pan and level the top with a spatula.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan 10 minutes; run a knife around edges of the pan to loosen, and invert onto a serving plate to cool completely before slicing.",
