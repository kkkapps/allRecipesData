    "ins": "Put chicken, onion, and garlic in a large stockpot with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain and reserve liquid. Set chicken aside to cool. Remove and discard bones from chicken. Chop the chicken meat.\nPut tomatoes in a large stockpot with enough water to just cover; add carrots, potatoes, zucchinis, yellow squash, green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, red bell pepper, and chayote squash. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.\nPour reserved chicken stock into the pot. Stir chopped chicken, cilantro, and tomato bouillon into the liquid. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook another 15 to 20 minutes.",
