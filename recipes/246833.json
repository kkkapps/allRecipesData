    "des": "\"This is my Gram's recipe for a cheese kugel - hence the name blintz (like cheese blintzes). It is very filling and does not last long at any occasion. You can use low-fat cheeses if you prefer. Serve it with sour cream if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles; cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.\nBeat eggs and sugar together in a bowl until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cottage cheese, farmers cheese, sour cream, and melted butter; mix well to combine. Stir in noodles.\nSpread noodle mixture in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle corn flakes on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.",
