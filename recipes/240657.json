Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain, rinse, rinse saucepan, and transfer watermelon to a bowl.\nCombine 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup white sugar, and lemongrass in the same saucepan; bring to a boil, add watermelon rind, and stir to coat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid evaporates, about 30 minutes. Continue simmering, stirring constantly, until remaining liquid evaporates and watermelon rind has a gumdrop-like consistency, about 30 minutes more.\nTransfer watermelon rind to prepared baking sheet and roll to coat with sugar.
