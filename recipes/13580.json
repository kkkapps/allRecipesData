    "des": "\"I make this salad all year long, but it is especially great for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Just freeze a few bags of cranberries to use at a later date. I know this will become a tradition to anyone who tries it, it's delicious! Garnish with frosted cranberries and mint leaves, if desired. For frosted cranberries, wet cranberries with water, and roll in sugar.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine cranberries, apple, celery, grapes, raisins, walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, and yogurt. (I chop cranberries in a food processor, and it works great). Toss to coat. Cover, and chill 2 hours. Stir just before serving.",
