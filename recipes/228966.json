    "des": "\"I grew up vegetarian and love Mexican food. As a kid, we used to have bean tacos. Inspired by a family friend, and by my maturing taste buds, I created this recipe to liven up my vegetarian taco experience.\n\nThis is, of course, just the filling, and you can add whatever toppings to your taco that you want. This recipe tends to match better with red taco sauces than with green ones. \n\nExtra filling can be reheated later or eaten cold as a mango tofu salsa. \n\nEnjoy!\"",
