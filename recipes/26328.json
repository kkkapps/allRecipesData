    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.) Roll dough out to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate. Roll out top crust and set aside. In a small bowl, mix together sugar and flour. \nPlace 2 cups of berries in the pastry lined pie pan and sprinkle with half of sugar mixture. Put in remaining two cups of gooseberries, then sprinkle on remaining sugar mixture.  Dot with butter. Cover with top crust and seal and flute edge. Cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. \nBake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool. You may wish to cover the edge of pie with foil to prevent over-browning. If you do so, remove the foil for the final 15 minutes of baking.",
