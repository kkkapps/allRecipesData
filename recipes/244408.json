    "ins": "Gently tear open the Burrata cheese to expose the soft, creamy core and place it in the middle of a plate. Arrange peach slices in and around the cheese. Sprinkle basil leaves over cheese and top with olive oil.\nBring raspberry balsamic vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vinegar reduces to a thick syrup, about 5 minutes. Spoon balsamic syrup over peaches and cheese; season with sea salt and black pepper.",
