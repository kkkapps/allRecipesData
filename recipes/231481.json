    "des": "\"This heart-healthy, quick, and easy dish is something very easy to throw together for dinner. It's perfect for dinner and lunch the next day and is just as tasty hot or cold. \n\nKate originally came up with this recipe after coming back from the gym with no fresh ingredients on hand. Just by using what was in the pantry and freezer this amazing dish came together. \n\nAlthough it is vegetarian friendly, many meat eaters will be satisfied with this high-protein meal.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and butter to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat. Add couscous and stir well. Cover saucepan and  let couscous sit until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir cannellini beans, kale, and garlic in the hot oil until kale is wilted, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix kale mixture into couscous; fold in almonds.\nSpoon couscous mixture into 4 serving bowls; top with Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and black pepper.",
