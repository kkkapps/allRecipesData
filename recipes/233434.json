    "des": "\"This yummy peach cobbler was developed by my mom and me one night after dinner. It hits the spot if you are having a sweet craving, but it isn't super high in calories. This recipe will work in a 9x11-inch glass baking dish as well. Add a bit of ice cream if desired and enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace 1 cup peaches into 8 individual ramekins. Mix 1/2 cup water and white sugar together in a bowl; stir until sugar is dissolved. Evenly divide sugar mixture over peaches. Sprinkle peaches with cinnamon and nutmeg. Dot about 3/4 teaspoon butter onto each serving of peaches.\nUnroll and separate crescent roll dough; completely cover peaches in each ramekin with 1 piece of dough. Cut small slits into each roll for ventilation during baking. Lightly brush each roll with water and sprinkle each with about 1/8 teaspoon brown sugar. Arrange ramekins onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cobblers are browned, 11 to 13 minutes. Allow cobblers to cool for 20 minutes before serving.",
