    "des": "\"Started by my mom when I was very young, this sandwich has been a tradition for years on family camping trips. My children and grandchild now insist I make them on all our camping trips. Each person assembles their own sandwich just how they like it, with or without sauerkraut, extra cheese, or any way in-between. Use a permanent marker to label the packets. You'll never want another Reuben that isn't made over a campfire!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat a grill for low heat.\nCut 4 large squares of aluminum foil. Place 2 slices of bread side-by-side on each piece of foil. Spread the bread slices with Thousand Island dressing. Evenly divide the corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut among the bread. Top with a second slice of bread to make a sandwich. Wrap the foil snugly around the sandwich to make a sealed packet.\nPlace the packets on the preheated grill. Cook, turning every 10 minutes, until the bread is lightly toasted and cheese melted, about 30 minutes.",
