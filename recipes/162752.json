Total prep and cook time will be less than 10 minutes per sandwich if preparing several sandwiches, and will depend on microwave wattage.\"",
    "ins": "Place the meatballs into a glass baking dish and heat in the microwave until hot, about 45 seconds per 6 meatballs. Remove from the microwave, add the spaghetti sauce, cover and return to the microwave. Heat until bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes depending on your microwave.\nSpoon the meatballs and sauce onto the rolls and top each one with two slices of provolone cheese. Return to the microwave and heat until cheese melts, about 15 seconds.",
