    "des": "\"My dad always said we had to wait until there was at least 2 and 1/2 feet of snow already on the ground with more coming steadily because then we knew the snow was clean.  I can count on one hand the number of times the snow was clean enough to make snow ice cream.  It's almost worth moving to a part of the country that gets more snow because boy is it good stuff!  This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine evaporated milk, eggs, vanilla and sugar until smooth.  Gradually stir in snow until mixture reaches desired consistency.  Eat at once.",
