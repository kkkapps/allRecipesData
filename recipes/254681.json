    "des": "\"I love my mom's pickled beets, but I don't always want to go through the fuss of making a batch. This recipe takes about as much time as boiling water! No special equipment needed. The hardest part is waiting for the beets to become infused with flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Drain beet juice from the jar, leaving about 1/2 inch juice in the bottom.\nCombine sugar, vinegar, salt, and cloves in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves into a syrup, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPour syrup over beets in the jar, covering them completely. Seal jar and shake gently.\nRefrigerate beets for 2 to 3 days before serving.",
