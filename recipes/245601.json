    "des": "\"I wasn't able to find a recipe like this for rutabaga anywhere, so I came up with one on my own, and it was fantastic!  Just make sure that you thoroughly cook your rutabaga--it's not so good when it still has that bitter semi-raw taste.\"",
    "ins": "Adjust oven rack to bottom position. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a large roasting pan with olive oil.\nToss potatoes, rutabaga, carrots, red onion, and white onion in a large mixing bowl. Add 1/4 cup olive oil and toss to evenly coat vegetables. Mix in lemon juice and garlic. Add Italian seasoning, lemon pepper, and sea salt; toss to thoroughly distribute ingredients. Transfer vegetable mixture to the prepared roasting pan.\nRoast in preheated oven until rutabaga is easily pierced with a fork and bright yellow or orange, about 45 minutes.",
