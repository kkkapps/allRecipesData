    "des": "\"Frozen chicken wings are cooked to perfection in the Panasonic CIO while you quickly make a simple sauce to toss them in. Now you're ready to tailgate in record time.\"",
    "ins": "Arrange chicken wings on a grill pan. Cook in the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven on \"Auto Cook\" setting 1 until browned, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nMake barbeque sauce by whisking ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes together in a small sauce pan until well combined. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nPlace cooked wings in a large bowl; pour desired amount of sauce over top and toss to coat well.",
