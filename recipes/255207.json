    "des": "\"The hemp seed nuts need to be cooked under 350 degrees F or you will destroy the beneficial Omega fats in them. They are a healthy nut alternative for people who are allergic to nuts/peanuts. The dark chocolate paired with the mocha flavor pudding is very tasty. You can really use any flavor pudding. I have used chocolate, mocha, vanilla, and coconut, all with great results.\"",
