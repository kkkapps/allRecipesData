    "des": "\"The ultimate mans BBQ sauce! This is my husband's favorite BBQ sauce and has become a favorite for anyone I have ever made this for. A delicious healthier twist on traditional BBQ sauce! The carrots add a hint of sweetness and you won't even know they're there! Great starting point for quick and easy meals (see notes) or seal it in a mason jar for an impressive homemade gift.\"",
