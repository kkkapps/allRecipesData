    "des": "\"A paleo-friendly entree that is quick and easy! It's a perfect summer recipe. The paleolithic diet is low-carb, dairy-free, and soy-free. I serve this with pineapple rings and other fruit. I also like to put a little unsweetened shredded coconut over the hash. This would also be good topped with a fruit chutney or a fruit puree. Goes great with green beans or broccoli.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together almond flour, coconut flour, tuna, orange juice, almond milk, baking powder, pineapple, and egg in a bowl until incorporated into a batter.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop batter into skillet and allow it to cook, without mixing, about 3 minutes. Flip batter with a spatula every 3 minutes for about 15 minutes, or until there is an even mixture of light tuna color and golden, crispy batter on each side.",
