    "des": "\"To most people, the ban of butter in French toast preparation might come as a surprise or even shock. But I'm not most people. I grew up with a father who is 'allergic' to the smell of butter (his other 'allergies' include cilantro and lamb). As such, our French toast, along with any other sauteing endeavors, were prepared using oil.\n\n\n I've had French toast numerous times and wanted try a different approach today. And that is when pineapple sage-scented challah French toast was born. Welcome to the world! I hope you have a long, successful life.\"",

Strain and discard leaves and reserve 'scented' milk.\nWhisk remaining milk, egg, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Add sage-scented milk to egg mixture and whisk.\nSoak challah bread slices in the egg mixture until saturated, about 2 minutes per side.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook soaked bread slices in hot oil until golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side.",
