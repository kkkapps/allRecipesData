    "des": "\"A fool-proof method for making eye-of-round roast for dinner or sandwiches. My warehouse store stopped selling a particular roast beef we liked for sandwiches, so I turned to this slowly roasted method to make our own.\"",
    "ins": "Season all sides of beef roast evenly with garlic salt; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 18 to 24 hours.\nPlace rack in middle position of oven and preheat to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).\nPat roast dry with paper towel and rub with 2 teaspoons canola oil; season with black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until small wisps of smoke rise from the oil. Brown the roast completely, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer roast to a rack set into a roasting pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a meat probe thermometer or instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center reads 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) for medium-rare, 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 hours.\nTurn oven off and leave roast in oven without opening door until meat probe thermometer reads 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare, 30 to 50 more minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing thin.",
