    "ins": "Place the cranberries into a saucepan and fill with just enough water so that they are floating slightly. Bring to a boil and cook until the cranberries pop. Remove from the heat and pour off any excess water. Run through a food mill, or strain back into the saucepan. Stir in the sugar and cook over low heat just long enough to dissolve the sugar. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold.\nWhen the cranberry mixture is cold, stir in the milk and heavy cream. Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
