    "des": "\"This was an 'on-the-fly' recipe I came up with while trying to avoid the same-old chicken dinner. If you prefer more heat, leave the seeds and ribs of the jalapeno in before pureeing.\"",
    "ins": "Puree jalapeno pepper, garlic, shallot, and 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Add parsley and thyme; process again to integrate.\nRub the jalapeno pepper mixture evenly onto the chicken thighs, place onto a platter and cover with plastic wrap; marinate in refrigerator at least 1 hour, up to 24 hours.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-low heat. Cook chicken thighs in hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter, retaining drippings in the skillet.\nReduce heat under the skillet to low. Pour wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food from the bottom of the pan with a flat-edged wooden spoon. Stir lime juice and honey into the wine; bring to a simmer and cook until the volume of the liquid reduces slightly, about 5 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet. Pour broth over the chicken.\nTransfer skillet to preheated oven and bake until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
