    "des": "\"If you happen to raise your own chickens or have access to really fresh eggs, a pressure cooker is the best way to make hard-cooked eggs. It doesn't really save time (the pressure cooker's usual claim to fame), but here's why it's great: it actually makes fresh eggs easy to peel!\"",
    "ins": "Fill pressure cooker with the minimum amount of water specified by the manufacturer. Place eggs in the steamer basket above the water. Seal the lid and bring the pressure cooker up to low pressure.\nCook, maintaining low pressure, for 6 minutes. Remove the pressure cooker from heat and allow the pressure to drop for 5 minutes.\nCombine cold water and ice in a large bowl.\nUse the quick-release method to open the pressure cooker. Transfer the hot eggs to the ice water using an oven mitt or spoon. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.",
