    "des": "\"This recipe is easy and delicious. The smaller the eggs the better for good absorption of pickling juice.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs in a large stock pot and cover with cold water. You may need to cook the eggs in 2 batches if you do not have a pot large enough. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool under cold running water, and peel. Pierce each egg with a knife or fork to assist in the absorption of liquid.\nTransfer eggs to a large glass jar or other deep, sealable glass container. Place beer, vinegar, pickling spice, and parsley flakes together in a bowl. Pour over eggs until fully submerged. (Be sure to select a container in which the eggs are completely covered, or add additional pickling liquid, if necessary.)  Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 days before using. Can be sealed and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks in pickling liquid.",
