    "des": "\"I first came across this recipe while visiting my wife's family in Buck's County, PA.  It goes great with Thanksgiving dinner as a side dish.  The original recipe was savory and comes from Eastern Europe and dates back more than 1,000 years.  This particular recipe is most likely a variation of a recipe brought over to the new world by German/Dutch immigrants.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x12 inch baking dish.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the apricot preserves, eggs, butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt, and mix to thoroughly combine. Fold in the cottage cheese and noodles, and spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the center of the kugel is cooked and set, about 50 minutes. Remove the kugel and top with Cheddar cheese, return to the oven, and bake until the cheese is browned and bubbling, about 10 minutes. Let the kugel rest for 10 minutes before serving.",
