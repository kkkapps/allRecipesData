    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nPlace noodles in a large bowl. Mix margarine into the noodles until melted. Stir in the eggs, sugar, applesauce, and vanilla extract. Pour noodle mixture into a 9x13 inch baking pan, then sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover the kugel and bake until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.",
