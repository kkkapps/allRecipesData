    "des": "\"I wanted to try this technique after having similar skinless cherry tomatoes at a Japanese restaurant. Cherry tomato skins can sometimes be tough, and you really don't notice that until it's not there anymore. Choose the most perfect tomatoes you can find for this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Cut small, shallow X on the bottom of each tomato. Remove any stems. Place some ice cubes in a bowl of water.\nBring a pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes and stir them gently until skin begins to peel back from Xs, about 10 to 20 seconds. Immediately transfer tomatoes to ice water with a slotted spoon.\nGently peel off skins and place \"naked\" tomatoes in a bowl.\nPlace mint leaves in a small bowl. Add vinegar, olive oil, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. Mix until well blended, bruising the mint leaves to release the flavor. Drizzle over tomatoes. Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 30 to 60 minutes. About halfway through chilling, gently stir to coat tomatoes in dressing.\nDrizzle with a few drops of sherry vinegar and olive oil, if desired. Serve drizzled with dressing and a sprinkle of sea salt.",
