    "des": "\"Ciao! This is an old recipe, hence the enormous measurements. Makes enough for a huge Italian family!  You can half the recipe; leave yeast and eggs the same. They are excellent with wine or coffee, and make good teething biscuits if you leave out the fennel seeds.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water.  Let stand for 5 minutes.\nIn a large bowl combine butter or margarine, sugar, salt, and egg.  Add yeast mixture and 1/2 of the flour and mix until smooth. Stir in the remaining flour and the seeds. Mix in additional water as needed to make a stiff dough.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead well.  Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn once to coat surface. Cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm spot to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.\nRoll dough into short ropes about 1/2 inch thick. Join ends to form donut shape. Set aside to rise for a few minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFill a large saucepan half full of water; bring to a boil.  Drop taralli into water and boil for 1 minute.  Remove from water, letting both sides dry on a sheet of waxed paper.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) on a lightly greased cookie sheet, turning a few times during baking until medium brown and crisp.",
