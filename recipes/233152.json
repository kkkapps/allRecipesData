    "des": "\"I was overrun with tomatillos in my garden and had to do something with them. After tasting the ripe ones (they turn purple) and realizing they taste a lot like rhubarb, I made a few alterations to one of my favorite rhubarb pie recipes from allrecipes.com and viola, a new creation! I was totally amazed with the taste and I think you will be too!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.\nStir tomatillos, strawberries, tapioca, sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl; let stand, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 15 minutes. Spoon tomatillo-strawberry mixture into the prepared pie crust. Scatter butter slices over filling.\nCover pie with second pie crust and pinch edges together to seal. Cut slits into top crust for ventilation. Place pie on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until top crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 50 minutes.",
