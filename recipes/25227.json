    "des": "\"This creamy, slightly tart Hollandaise sauce is made from an emulsion of egg yolks, butter, and lemon juice cooked over gentle heat. The secret is to keep the heat LOW so that the egg yolks don't curdle, and to whisk constantly.\"",
    "ins": "Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.\nAdd the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly. If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm until ready to serve.",
