    "des": "\"The Roasted New Potato Salad With Olives exemplifies an amazingly quick - cooking technique. Instead of roasting the potatoes in a preheated oven, start them in a cold oven and roast them as the oven heats. Cooked this way, they brown nearly twice as fast.\"",
    "ins": "Toss potatoes in oil with herbs, a generous sprinkling of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Place potatoes, cut side down, in a single layer on a lipped cookie sheet. Set pan on lowest rack of cold oven; heat oven to 450 degrees. Roast until cut side is golden brown and potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.\nTransfer potatoes to a large bowl; add olives, onion and parsley.\nWhisk vinegar, mayonnaise, garlic, a big pinch of salt and a couple of grinds of pepper in a 1-cup glass measuring cup. Slowly whisk in oil, first in droplets, then in a slow, steady stream. Pour dressing over warm salad; toss to coat. Serve at room temperature for best flavor.",
