    "ins": "Mix the soy sauce, salt, cornstarch, and sherry in a large bowl.  Stir in chicken; cover and refrigerate.\nHeat 1 1/2 cups of the peanut oil in a large, deep skillet.  Fry almonds in the oil until golden, about 1 minute. Drain fried almonds on a paper towel.\nDrain all but 3 tablespoons of oil from the skillet.  Stir in the mushrooms, bamboo shoots, celery, onion, and water chestnuts. Cook and stir vegetables for 1 minute. Remove from skillet.\nHeat 1/4 cup oil in the skillet. Cook and stir the marinated chicken in hot oil until no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cooked vegetables, chicken stock, and reserved soy sauce mixture; simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in fried almonds before serving.",
