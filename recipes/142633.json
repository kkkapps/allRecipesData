    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil a 9-inch baking dish with spray cooking oil.\nPlace the bread cubes in a small bowl. Melt the butter in a large skillet, and pour half over the bread cubes. Toss cubes and set the bowl aside.\nAdd the onion to the remaining butter in the skillet and cook over medium heat until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the chopped ham. Stir in the cream of celery soup and the milk. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring. Remove from heat.\nPut the rice and water into the baking dish. Top with the drained green beans. Then spoon the ham mixture on top of the green beans. Cover with the slices of American cheese, then sprinkle over all with the bread cubes.\nBake uncovered until cheese melts and edges bubble, about 45 minutes.",
