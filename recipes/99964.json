    "des": "\"I invented this recipe at the end of the week when groceries were running low-just a few ingredients make up this easy pasta dish. This can be a healthier yet still flavorful meal by using low-fat sour cream and whole wheat pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until tender. Drain.\nWhile you wait for the pasta, combine the tomatoes and spinach in a saucepan over medium heat. When the spinach begins to wilt, stir in the sour cream and pesto. Toss sauce with drained pasta and serve immediately.",
