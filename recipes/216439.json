    "des": "\"After eating this at a restaurant in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, I was surprised that the chef was willing to give me the recipe.  My favorite way of preparing salmon. A suitable meal for special company.  Excellent with Pinot Grigio - our favorite is Ecco Domani\u00c2\u00ae.  We usually serve it with baked rice with pine nuts.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nTrim the salmon fillets, if necessary, to remove thin portion; with a very sharp knife, cut the fillets horizontally through the center but leave one end uncut so the fillet opens like a book. Place 1/4 of the lump crabmeat onto each opened fillet, and top crab with a slice of smoked Gouda; close the fillets. Place each fillet into a single-serving baking dish. Mix the melted butter and juice of 1 lemon in a small bowl, and drizzle the lemon butter over all the salmon fillets.\nBake in the preheated oven until the salmon is opaque and flakes easily, 30 minutes or as needed.\nIn a bowl, mix the juice of the 2nd lemon with sour cream and dill; spoon sour cream mixture over each baked fillet, and sprinkle liberally with capers. Serve immediately.",
