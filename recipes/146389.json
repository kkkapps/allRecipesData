    "des": "\"This cake is good when you don't want to make something too sweet with cream and icing and stuff. The sweetness comes from just cinnamon, sugar, and a little grapefruit. Use grapefruit slices for garnish. You can use honey with grapefruit zest instead of the powdered sugar and water if you don't like sugary glazes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition then stir in the milk and grapefruit juice. Mix in the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, and salt. Pour resulting batter into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick or small knife inserted in the crown comes out clean, about 45 minutes.\nWhile the cake is baking, prepare the icing. Place the sugar in a bowl and gradually stir in the water. Add the grapefruit juice and salt; pour over warm cake. It should form a glaze as it cools.",
