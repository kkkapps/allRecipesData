    "des": "\"Chipotle Fish Tacos are made with a mango-cilantro salsa, and chipotle aioli sauce is served with garlic spiked black beans and Spanish rice. I have run this special in the last restaurant I worked at as a daily special. It always sold out! I hope that you will try this recipe, it is a hit if you enjoy fish tacos!\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the chipotle chile powder, garlic powder, salt, and cracked black pepper in a shallow bowl. Brush the tilapia fillets with the canola oil, and press into the spice mixture to coat, and set aside. Make the salsa by stirring together the mango, jalapeno, red onion, 1 clove garlic, cilantro, and lime juice in a separate bowl, and set aside. Make the aioli by stirring together the chipotle puree, 1 clove garlic, and mayonnaise in a small bowl, and set aside.\nBring the black beans and 2 cloves of garlic to a simmer in a saucepan with a pinch of salt. Cover, and cook over low heat for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the tilapia until opaque in the center, and crispy on both sides, about 7 minutes. Heat the tortillas in a skillet over medium heat, and keep warm.\nTo serve, place the tortillas on a plate, spoon on some Spanish rice and black beans. Top with some of the coleslaw mix, hot tilapia, and a spoonful of the mango-cilantro salsa. Top with a dollop of chipotle aioli to serve.",
