Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.\nBeat 1 egg in a large bowl until foamy. Add onion, ground beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic; mix until combined. Mold mixture into a loaf on a baking sheet.\nUnroll crescent rolls and use to cover meatloaf completely, seaming seals and perforations so that no meat is visible.\nWhisk remaining egg and water in a small bowl to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over crust.\nBake meatloaf in the preheated oven until crust is very dark and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes.",
