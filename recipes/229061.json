The stripes on the fries are caused by the moisture escaping the jicama and creating fissures where the starch from the jicama collects and browns.\"",
    "ins": "Spray a microwave-safe plate with cooking spray. Arrange jicama pieces on plate.\nCook in the microwave on high until small brown stripes begin to form on the fries, 9 to 11 minutes. Check on the fries every few minutes to avoid burning. Remove plate from microwave with an oven mitt because plate will be hot.",
