    "des": "\"This is a wonderful, spicy chicken stew served over rice. I make it often for my husband and friends. It can easily be doubled to feed a crowd. It is an amazing African dish. I learned it from a good friend who was a missionary kid in Sierra Leone and Zaire. It can easily be modified for vegans by substituting vegetable broth and adding vegetables instead of chicken. Any fresh or frozen veggies that you have on hand can be added.\"",
    "ins": "Melt peanut butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in tomato paste, and blend with peanut butter until smooth. Mix in diced tomatoes with green chile peppers and chicken broth. Cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nHeat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Saute chicken and onions until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.\nMix chicken, onions, and mushrooms into the peanut butter mixture, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Season with cayenne pepper.",
