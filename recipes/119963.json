    "des": "\"Bacon-wrapped water chestnuts, pineapple chunks and stew meat are basted with a simple marinade from Gerri Layo of Massena, New York. 'These kabobs can be assembled ahead, so they're ideal for family get-togethers,' she writes. 'They're a delicious alternative to hot dogs and hamburgers.'\"",
    "ins": "In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first seven ingredients; mix well. Remove 1/3 cup for basting; cover and refrigerate. Add beef to bag; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate overnight.\nIn a skillet over medium heat, partially cook the bacon. Wrap each piece around a water chestnut slice. Drain and discard marinade from beef. On metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread bacon-wrapped water chestnuts, pineapple and beef. Grill, covered, over medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness, basting frequently with reserved marinade.",
