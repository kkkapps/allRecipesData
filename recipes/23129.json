Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has browned slightly.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.\nSoak the slice of bread in the milk and gently squeeze out the milk; set the milk aside. Crumb the bread into a large mixing bowl. Mix bread together with ground beef, curry powder, 1 egg, sugar, salt, black pepper, turmeric, vinegar, chutney, almonds and raisins.\nPlace the mixture the prepared baking dish. Insert the bay leaves into the meat. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.\nBeat the remaining egg with 3 tablespoons of the drained milk. Pour over the meat and bake for another 30 minutes.",
