    "ins": "In a large skillet over medium high heat, fry the bacon for 5 to 10 minutes, or until well browned. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon from the skillet and set aside. In small batches, saute the meat in the bacon fat until browned. Use a slotted spoon and set the stew meats aside as well.\nMelt the butter in the bacon fat in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the flour, caraway seeds, paprika and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir for two minutes until all the flour is dissolved. Whisk in the vinegar and tomato. The mixture should be very thick.\nNext, pour in the beef stock, beer, salt, water, red bell peppers, reserved bacon and reserved meat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Stir in the potatoes, parsnip, celery and carrots and continue to simmer, covered, for 30 more minutes, or until all vegetables are tender.\nStir in the breadcrumbs until stew has thickened. Add the cabbage and peas and simmer for 5 more minutes. (Note: For best results, allow soup to cool slightly, then refrigerate overnight and reheat before serving.)",
