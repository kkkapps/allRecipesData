    "des": "\"Seasoned pork chops are smothered in a mushroom sauce, baked with lots of fresh mushroom slices and chopped onion. This healthier recipe uses natural mushroom soup, thickened with cornstarch, instead of regular condensed mushroom soup.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with seasoned salt and pepper. Place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine onion, mushrooms, and soup in a separate small bowl. Mix together and spoon over chops.\nCover and bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 15 more minutes. (Note:  Time could be less or more depending on thickness of chops.)  Pork chops are done with their internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nPour sauce into a medium pot and bring to a simmer. Whisk together cornstarch and 1/2 cup of sauce in a small bowl. Whisk into pot and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes longer. Serve with pork chops.",
