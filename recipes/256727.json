    "des": "\"Great spicy, exotic chicken dish. I created this mashup of several recipes to inaugurate my new tagine, but I think any skillet, loosely covered, should work. Serve over couscous.\"",
    "ins": "Mix paprika, cumin, salt, cayenne, cinnamon, turmeric, and black pepper together in a small bowl.\nPat chicken thighs dry and place them in a resealable plastic bag. Sprinkle paprika mixture over chicken thighs; massage the bag to coat chicken evenly.\nHeat oil in a tagine over medium heat. Add chicken; cook until browned, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Cook and stir fennel, onion, and garlic in the tagine. Stir in half of the garbanzo beans, chicken broth, 1/2 cup green olives, harissa, 1/2 of the preserved lemon, and ginger.\nLay chicken over garbanzo bean mixture; sprinkle remaining olives on top. Scatter cherry tomatoes on top. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until chicken is tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\nCombine remaining garbanzo beans with 2 tablespoons of broth from the tagine in a food processor or blender; blend into a thin paste.\nTransfer chicken to a serving dish. Stir garbanzo bean paste into the tagine. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Spoon broth mixture over chicken.\nGarnish with remaining preserved lemon and toasted almonds.",
