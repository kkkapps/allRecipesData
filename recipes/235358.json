    "des": "\"This super-easy braised beef pasta sauce is similar to regular ground meat sauces, but instead of ground beef, it uses freshly cubed beef as the base. The advantages are obvious and quite delicious. \n\nUsing this method, you get to choose the cut you like; I used top round, but rump roast or chuck steak would be just as good. You can also control the fat content.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook beef, stirring often, until well browned, about 15 minutes. Stir garlic and green onions into the beef. Cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Pour beef broth into skillet and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.\nPour in milk, bring to a simmer, and stir pasta sauce into beef mixture. Simmer until beef pieces are tender, about 40 minutes. If mixture is too thick, add a little water. Season with salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and Italian herbs.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Pour penne into sauce and toss lightly to coat. Transfer into a serving bowl and serve topped with a sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.",
