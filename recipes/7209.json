    "des": "\"This bread was created from leftover dough after making a foccacia dressed with Kalamata olives, garlic, and olive oil. This version has the olives and garlic baked in the bread.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl dissolve sugar in 1/2 cup warm water. To proof yeast, stir in yeast and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes in a warm place.\nPreheat oven to 105 degree F (40 degrees C). Warm an oven-safe bowl in the oven.\nPlace flour in bowl of food processor. Add salt and pulse for a few seconds.\nStart food processor. Pour proofed yeast into flour through hole. Immediately add the additional 3/4 cup warm water, then the olive oil. Process for about 1 minute or until dough ball cleans the sides of the processor bowl. If dough is too wet add a little flour through the top while processing, or if too dry, add a little more water.\nTurn off food processor. Remove lid and transfer dough to the heated bowl. Cover with a plate or plastic wrap.\nLet rise for a half hour in a warm place, like the lukewarm oven.\nIn a small bowl, combine minced garlic and chopped olives. Set aside.\nOnce dough has risen, transfer dough to a lightly floured board. Make an indentation in the dough and place olive mixture inside. Knead dough 10 times. Bulk of mixture should remain in middle of dough. Form dough into a log or round loaf shape.\nGrease a pie pan (for a round loaf) or a baking sheet (for a log) and dust with cornmeal. Place loaf on prepared pan, cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake bread in preheated oven until browned and loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.",
