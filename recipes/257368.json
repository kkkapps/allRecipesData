    "ins": "Combine ancho chile powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, salt, and fennel in a small bowl.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add spice mixture and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 30 seconds.\nReduce heat to medium and add lentils, tomato paste, a few splashes of water, and chipotle peppers. Cook, mashing lightly with a fork and adding water if necessary, until lentils are heated through and hold together, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt if needed and adobo or hot sauce.\nLightly toast tortillas in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Spread about 1/3 cup filling down center of each tortilla. Top with lettuce, tomatoes, and cilantro. Serve with guacamole and lime wedges.",
