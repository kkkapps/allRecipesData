Spread potatoes slightly apart in a single layer on a baking sheet.\nBake potatoes in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.\nSprinkle salt over potatoes. Spread 1/2 the Cheddar cheese, 1/2 the Monterey Jack cheese, and 1/2 the mozzarella cheese over the potatoes. Sprinkle 1/2 the onions, 1/2 the chicken, and 1/2 the jalapeno peppers respectively over the cheese. Repeat layering with remaining cheeses, onion, chicken, and jalapenos.\nBake nachos in the oven until cheese melts and chicken is hot, 10 to 15 minutes.
