Pat lightly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Pour blueberries over the top.\nIn another medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, 1/2 cup of sugar, egg yolks and 1 teaspoon of vanilla until smooth. Pour over the blueberries.\nBake for 60 to 70 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is lightly browned. Cool, then run a knife around the edge of the pan.
