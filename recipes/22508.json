    "ins": "In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and 2 tablespoons sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the butter and remaining 1 cup sugar; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.\nIn a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the milk mixture, eggs, salt and 3 cups of flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.\nPunch down dough and divide into thirds; divide each portion in a 14 inch roll; divide each roll into 14 pieces.  Roll the pieces into 9 inch ropes and tie into knots.  Place the rolls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven) for 15 minutes until lightly browned. Remove from oven and brush with melted butter.",
