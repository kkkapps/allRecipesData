    "des": "\"This is a wonderful light whipped pumpkin pie. My husband doesn't like traditional pumpkin pie but loves this recipe I came up with. The cream cheese adds a wonderful flavor with a traditional pie taste but light/whipped. It is made with a homemade graham cracker crust.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine graham cracker crumbs, 2/3 cup sugar, and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Mix until evenly moistened, then press into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Place pan on a baking sheet.\nBake the crust in the preheated oven until lightly browned and toasted, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow crust to cool.\nBeat cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixture until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in pumpkin puree until completely incorporated.\nFold whipped topping into pumpkin mixture; stir in nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice. Pour pumpkin mixture into graham cracker crust.
