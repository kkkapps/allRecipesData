Try substituting almond extract for the peppermint.  You can roll them in colored sugar before flattening them, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with peppermint extract.  Beat in half the confectioners' sugar until smooth.  Knead in remaining confectioners' sugar until fully incorporated.  Shape dough into 1/2 inch balls, place on baking sheets, flatten with a fork, and allow to stand 1 hour to harden.  Store in airtight containers in refrigerator.",
