    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a shallow 3-quart baking dish.\nLayer about 1/3 the potatoes into the bottom of the baking dish; top with layers of about 1/3 each of onion, garlic, bacon, and Swiss cheese, respectively. Season the layers with 1/4 teaspoon salt and about 1/3 the black pepper. Repeat the onion, garlic, bacon, and Swiss cheese layering. Top with the remaining potatoes, onion, garlic, bacon, salt, and pepper; reserve the remaining Swiss cheese for later. Pour chicken broth evenly over the dish; dot with butter chunks.\nBake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Top with remaining Swiss cheese and continue baking until the cheese is melted and the broth absorbed, about 30 minutes more. Cool 10 minutes before serving.",
