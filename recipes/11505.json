    "des": "\"A great refrigerator cookie with a tropical twist.  This dough freezes well and only takes a few minutes to thaw and then bake.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Stir in vanilla. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir into the butter mixture. Then stir in the oatmeal, macadamia nuts and coconut.\nDivide dough into three portions and roll each portion into a log about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in plastic wrap and put into the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours, or wrap and freeze for up  to 2 months.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper. If frozen, let dough logs sit out at room temperature for 5 minutes.\nSlice each log into 1/4 inch rounds and place about 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown.",
