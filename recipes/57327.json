    "ins": "Place the dried apricots and 1 1/2 cups of water into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook for about 15 minutes, or until tender. Remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly.\nIn the container of a blender or large food processor, combine the apricots with any remaining water, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Cover, and puree until smooth. Set aside.\nPour 1 cup of water into a large bowl, and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let stand for about 5 minutes to dissolve the yeast. Mix in the shortening and salt. Gradually mix in the flour using a sturdy spoon until the dough is stiff enough to knead on a floured surface. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Do not set aside the dough to rise.\nRoll out the dough to 1/4 to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into circles with a large biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter. Spoon about a tablespoon of the filling in the center of the circles, and fold over. Seal the edges by pressing with your fingers.\nHeat about 1 inch of oil in a deep heavy skillet over medium-high heat, or to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry the pastries in the hot oil, turning once, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.",
