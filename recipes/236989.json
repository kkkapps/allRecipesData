    "des": "\"There is nothing exciting about sole. It's cheap, easy to find, has a mild, unremarkable flavor, and that's about it. Which means it's the perfect candidate for jazzing up by stuffing with crab. Serve with asparagus and lemon.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking dish.\nCombine crab, poblano pepper, panko bread crumbs, green onion, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.\nStir mayonnaise, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.\nPlace sole fillets, flat-side up, on a work surface. Season fillets with salt. Divide crab mixture between fillets and roll filets up around filling. Place rolled sole in the prepared baking dish.\nSpread 1/2 the mayonnaise mixture over the sides and tops of each sole roll to coat. Place remaining 1/2 the mayonnaise mixture in a piping bag. Pipe mayonnaise mixture in a zigzag pattern over the top of each roll and sprinkle paprika over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned on top and fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.",
