    "des": "\"This fragrant, tasty, lower-in-fat version of the traditional tourtiere has been made for 100 years by Colomb family to honor our Quebec origins. My Aunt Marguerite began baking these pies after Thanksgiving and froze them until her standup freezer was full for Christmas. It was tourtiere for all during the Christmas season! Serve with a fresh vegetable tray and cranberry sauce. This is wonderful home-made fast food.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 9 inch pie plate with one of the prepared crust, reserving the second crust. Refrigerate both until needed.\nPlace the ground pork, onion, sage, salt, and water in a large pan. Cook on low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, for 2 hours.\nDrain off any cooking liquid remaining in the pan. Spoon the pork mixture into the prepared pie crust. Top with the second pie crust, trim as needed, and crimp edges to seal. Pierce the crust in a few places with a fork.\nBake in preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.",
