    "des": "\"Wanted to come up with a new cookie using sugar substitutes that were fun and flavorful. Starting with a basic oatmeal cookie recipe, I decided to add blueberries and almond slices instead of raisins and chocolate chips. First time I ever made them, and they look, smell, and taste amazing.\"",
