    "des": "\"Fresh summer side dish that puts kale to good use. Flavored with sweet pineapple juice and zesty Cajun seasoning. Corn and kale often come together in a CSA box as well, so never through that kale away again! You can sub your favorite citrus juice for pineapple juice for a different flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add corn to boiling water and turn off heat. Let corn soak in hot water for 5 minutes. Remove the corn, reserving the cooking water in the pot. Set corn aside to cool before slicing kernels from the cobs into a mixing bowl.\nReturn the pot of water to a boil; add kale and 1 teaspoon salt. Boil kale until bright green and tender, about 5 minutes; drain and set kale aside to cool. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze as much liquid from the kale as you can. Separate leaves and add to bowl with corn kernels.\nStir red bell pepper, pineapple juice, olive oil, salsa, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder into the corn and kale.",
