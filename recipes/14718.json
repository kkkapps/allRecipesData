    "des": "\"This is a recipe that I came up with when I got tired of 'the same old thing'.  It's easy and delicious. You can add things like mushrooms or peppers. Serve with white rice or noodles, salad and bread. You can pour the sauce over the rice/noodles.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a extra-large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ribs to skillet and brown on all sides. Pour spaghetti sauce over ribs and stir in the water. Reduce heat and simmer, covered for 1 hour. Turn ribs after 1/2 hour of cooking. If the sauce gets too thick, thin it with a little more water.",
