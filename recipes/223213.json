Add bacon, Neufchatel cheese, and sour cream; stir to combine. Add mushroom mixture to sausage mixture, reserving about 1/4 cup mushroom mixture. Season with garlic and herb seasoning, salt, and black pepper.\nWarm Alfredo sauce with the reserved mushroom mixture in a pan over medium-low heat, 3 to 5 minutes.\nStuff each bell pepper with sausage-mushroom mixture; place in the prepared baking dish. Top each bell pepper with Cheddar cheese; pour warmed Alfredo sauce over and around the bell peppers. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until bell peppers are beginning to soften, about 30 minutes.
