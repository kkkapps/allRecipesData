    "ins": "Heat a skillet over medium heat and coat the inside with olive oil. Add chicken and garlic; cook and stir until chicken begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Drizzle mustard and maple syrup over chicken mixture and stir to evenly coat chicken. Cook and stir chicken mixture over medium-low heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes more.",
