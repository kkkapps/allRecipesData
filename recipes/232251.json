Beat on low speed with an electric hand mixer until blended. Scrape bowl and beat on medium speed for 4 more minutes.\nToss blueberries with enough cinnamon to evenly dust each berry in a bowl. Fold blueberries into the batter. Pour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar.",
