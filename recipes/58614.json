    "des": "\"If your family dislikes tomato based meatloaf like mine does then this is the meatloaf for you!  Sour cream and onion dip keeps the meat moist and it is served with a delicious sour cream and mushroom sauce.  My family usually adds a bit of Cajun seasoning blend since we Louisianians like our food spicy.  This recipe just might change your family's mind about meatloaf!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, combine ground beef, 1/2 cup of the onion dip, bread crumbs, celery, onion, dill, salt, pepper and eggs. Use your hands to mix until well blended. Press into a 9x5 inch loaf pan, or form a loaf and place it in a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature of the loaf is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).\nWhile the meatloaf is baking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining onion dip and cream of mushroom soup. Cook, stirring until heated through. Spoon over servings of meatloaf.",
