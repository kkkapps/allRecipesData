    "des": "\"This is really yummy and cheesy soup.  Every time I've made it, people beg for the recipe!  I use the (non-metallic) pot of my slow cooker to cook this soup in the microwave, but you can cook it more slowly in the slow cooker itself if you prefer.  This is especially great with bread bowls.\"",
    "ins": "Steam the broccoli in a steamer or in a colander over boiling water until tender and bright green, 15 minutes.  Set aside.\nIn a large microwave safe bowl, combine half-and-half, 2 cups water and cheese.  Cook in microwave until cheese is melted and smooth, stirring every 2 minutes.  Stir in salt, pepper and garlic powder and cook 2 minutes more.  In a separate bowl, combine cornstarch and remaining 2 cups water, stirring to dissolve.  Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the soup.  Return the soup to the microwave, heating and stirring every 2 minutes until thick.  Stir in broccoli; heat once more and serve.",
