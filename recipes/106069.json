    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat in a large frying pan.  Cook the garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Gently stir in the tofu and peanuts; cook until the tofu has lightly browned.  Pour in the soy sauce, and cook, stirring frequently, until absorbed by the tofu.  Remove from heat and let cool.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nToss the sliced cucumbers together with the chili sauce, lime juice, and cilantro.  Gently fold in the chilled tofu.",
