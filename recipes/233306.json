Add meatballs, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, mixed vegetables, pasta shells, ground ginger, oregano, basil, and cilantro; season with salt and pepper. Stirring occasionally, bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and cook at a simmer until the pasta shells are tender and meatballs are heated through, 12 to 15 minutes.",
