    "des": "\"Comparing mozzarella and burrata is a little unfair, as burrata is significantly richer and creamier. It's not like comparing apples and oranges; it's more like apples and supermodels. In fact, burrata means 'buttered,' which is really all you need to know.\"",
    "ins": "Place bottom tomato slice onto a plate and season with sea salt and black pepper. Spread burrata cheese over tomato slice and top with torn basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil. Top with next tomato slice. Repeat cheese-tomato layering process with remaining slices, finishing with top tomato slice.",
