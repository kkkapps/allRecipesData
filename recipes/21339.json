Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.\nIn a skillet, saute garlic in oil on low heat, just hot enough to make the garlic sizzle; about 10 to 15 minutes.  Season with basil, oregano, parsley, and crushed red pepper, and remove from heat.\nIn a large bowl, toss cooked pasta with garlic and herb mixture, and let sit for 3 to 5 minutes.  Sprinkle with Parmesan, and serve.",
