    "des": "\"After the news that a local cafe was closing, I begged the owner for this recipe. The sweetness of the red grapes compliments the curry perfectly and the almonds provide a nice crunch. It's always a hit and I'm always asked for the recipe. \nIt's nice served over a large leaf of romaine, on a croissant, or just out of the bowl with a fork!\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter in a large saucepan over low heat until melted; remove from heat and cool to room temperature.\nStir mayonnaise, garlic, parsley, and curry powder into butter until evenly incorporated. Fold in chicken, grapes, and almonds. Transfer mixture to a serving bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until flavors have blended, at least 1 hour.",
