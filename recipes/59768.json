    "des": "\"I created this sandwich one weekend when I couldn't decide whether to have turkey, roast beef, or ham. This sandwich has all three! You can substitute Italian roast beef for the regular roast beef to take this sandwich to another level. Most supermarket delis carry the Italian, you just have to ask. Also, the order of the ingredients is important for all of the tastes to blend properly.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nOpen the sandwich roll onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread the mustard-mayonnaise blend on one half of the roll and top with the turkey, Swiss cheese, and ham.\nSpread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise on the other half of the roll and top with the roast beef, tomato slices, and Muenster cheese.\nBroil the sandwich open-faced until the cheese melts and begins to bubble and the ham begins to crisp around the edges. Remove the sandwich from the oven and put both sides together.",
