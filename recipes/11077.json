    "des": "\"This recipe forms a rather stiff dough, you might have to press it in the pan.  One time I put raisins in the batter by mistake, and my husband loved them that  way. You can also omit the chocolate chips and have them plain if you wish.\"",
    "ins": "Mix peanut butter, butter or margarine, and sugars until creamy.  Stir in vanilla.  Beat in eggs. Mix in  flour. Stir in 3/4c chocolate chips.  Spread dough into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove pan from oven, and sprinkle  with the rest of the chocolate chips.  Let stand 5 minutes and spread.  Cool, and cut into bars.",
