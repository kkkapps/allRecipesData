    "ins": "Cut cauliflower into 3 or 4 'steaks'. Remove the stem and leaves from each 'steak' using a sharp knife; reserve the florets that have fallen off while slicing steaks.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook cauliflower 'steaks' in the hot oil until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add florets and water to skillet; cover and steam until cauliflower is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.\nHeat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; saute onion until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and saute until onion is lightly browned and mushrooms are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nArrange cauliflower 'steaks' and florets on a baking sheet; top with onion-mushroom mixture and Havarti cheese.\nBroil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes.",
