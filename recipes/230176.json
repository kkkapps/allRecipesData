    "des": "\"An herb rub makes this leg of lamb so good! I always knew it was Easter when my mom made it, and the whole house smells awesome when it's cooking. It's the only recipe I specifically asked for when I moved out on my own.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nMix garlic, salt, pepper, ginger, thyme, sage, add marjoram in a bowl. Stir soy sauce and vegetable oil into the garlic mixture until loosely paste-like; add the bay leaf.\nCut slits into the lamb on all sides. Rub herb mixture over entire surface of lamb, massaging it into the slits. Put lamb in a roasting pan.\nRoast lamb until browned on the outside and red in the center, about 50 minutes for rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Cover lamb loosely with aluminum foil and cool about 20 minutes before carving.",
