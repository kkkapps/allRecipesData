    "ins": "Pour water into a 6-quart pot; add potatoes and 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Place pot onto a cold burner. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook potatoes at a boil until potatoes are fork-tender, about 12 minutes; drain.\nCook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. Drain grease from the skillet, reserving 2 tablespoons in the skillet. Return skillet to medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallots in reserved drippings until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.\nCombine the shallots with the cream cheese, sour cream, butter, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Dump the potatoes atop the cream cheese mixture; beat with an electric hand mixer to desired consistency. Season with kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste. Transfer potatoes to a serving dish. Sprinkle parsley and bacon over the potatoes to serve.",
