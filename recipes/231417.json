    "des": "\"A family staple meal that has been in the monthly rotation for several years now and is still asked for quite often. This is great either served with refried beans and chips as a Mexican dish or with corn and steamed green beans as a casserole.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix chicken, cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, diced tomatoes with green chiles and juice, chicken broth, onion, and canned green chiles together in a bowl, stirring until thoroughly combined.\nPlace 1/3 of the tortilla strips in a layer into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture. Repeat layers twice more; sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese on top of the casserole.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown and casserole is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. If casserole is still slightly runny, let stand 5 to 10 minutes until firm.",
