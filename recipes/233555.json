    "des": "\"These bars are always a big hit and are a great way to use those fresh summer berries--though frozen blueberries work just as well. They're especially great with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nCombine flour, oats, 1 cup sugar, cinnamon, and baking soda in a large bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve about 2 cups flour-butter mixture. Press remaining mixture into the prepared baking dish to form a crust.\nBring blueberries, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice to a boil in a saucepan, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened, about 2 minutes. Spread blueberry mixture over crust and sprinkle with reserved oat mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until topping is just browned, about 25 minutes. Cool before cutting and serving.",
