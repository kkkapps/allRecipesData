    "des": "\"Kristin is right, her mom's zucchini bread recipe is great! We gave it a healthier spin by reducing the sugar, increasing the nuts, and adding a bit of buckwheat flour. Buckwheat flour is very nutritious: it contains the 8 amino acids, is high in lysine, and is a good source of B vitamins and iron - and it's gluten-free!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4-inch loaf pans.\nBeat eggs until light and frothy in a large bowl. Mix in oil and sugar. Stir in zucchini and vanilla extract. Combine all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nuts in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture. Divide batter into prepared pans.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes.",
