    "des": "\"Here is a fried Greek meatball - Cyprian style.   These are made with grated potatoes; a little different than the islands of Greece.  Squeeze some lemon on them and have a taste of Cyprus.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nPlace the lemon juice in a large bowl. Coarsely grate the potatoes into the lemon juice, stirring well to prevent browning. Stir in the ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, parsley, mint, cinnamon, lemon zest, eggs, and salt and pepper. Mix well, and shape into oblong balls about 1 inch thick and 2 inches wide.\nPlace meatballs in hot oil in batches; do not crowd. Fry until golden brown, and cooked through, about 6 to 7 minutes per batch. Serve with lemon wedges.",
