Stirring constantly, bring to a boil and boil for 3 minutes.  Pour over crackers completely.\nBake for 5-6 minutes, watch carefully.  Remove cookie sheet from oven, place it on oven door and sprinkle chips over baked crackers.  When chocolate gets soft, spread over crackers with back of a spoon.  Sprinkle slivered almonds on melted chocolate.  Place in refrigerator for at least 8 hours.  Break into cookie-size pieces.  This recipe freezes well.",
