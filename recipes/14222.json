    "des": "\"Bok choy is in the cabbage family, and is very popular in China. In this recipe, it is shredded to resemble a coleslaw, but that is where the resemblance to that creamy classic ends.  This dish is very spicy and full of flavor.  It not only tastes great, but is strangely fun to eat.  If you have chile paste, use 2 teaspoons of that instead of the red pepper flakes.\"",
    "ins": "Combine bok choy, red bell pepper, and scallions in a large bowl.\nIn a smaller bowl, whisk together red pepper flakes (or chile paste), mustard, apple cider vinegar, garlic, ginger, sugar, salt, and oil.\nPour this spicy dressing over the chopped vegetables, and toss well.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, then toss again. Taste salad, and add more chile paste, salt, or sugar to taste before serving.",
