    "des": "\"Start with the great taste of grilled salmon then finish under the broiler to form a crust of homemade pesto. This recipe is easy to make, but tastes and looks like a gourmet meal.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a small skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pine nuts in the hot skillet until fragrant and toasted, about 5 minutes.\nBlend basil, Parmesan cheese, toasted pine nuts, and garlic in a blender until a thick paste forms. Gradually stream olive oil into blender and continue blending until desired consistency of pesto is reached; season with salt and pepper.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Season both sides of salmon with salt and pepper.\nPlace salmon, skin-side down, onto grill grates; close grill and cook until salmon is about 2/3 done, 8 to 15 minutes. Remove salmon from grill using a spatula and transfer to a baking sheet, skin-side down. Spread pesto evenly over the salmon. Save extra pesto for another use if there are leftovers.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nBroil salmon until fish flakes easily with a fork and pesto is bubbling, about 5 minutes.",
