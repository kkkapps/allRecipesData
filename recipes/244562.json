    "des": "\"Braised brisket is a lovely dish. Advance preparation cuts down on last-minute cooking and makes it easier to remove the fat from the gravy.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grate 1 teaspoon zest from the lemon.\nHeat the olive oil in a roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until well browned on both sides. Remove the beef from the pan. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon pan drippings.\nReduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic cloves to the pan and cook until golden, stirring occasionally. Add the vinegar to the pan and cook and stir for 1 minute, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the stock, thyme and rosemary sprigs. Reduce the heat to low. Cook for 5 minutes.  Season with black pepper.\nReturn the beef to the pan. Spoon the stock mixture over the beef. Cover the pan.\nBake for 2 1/2 hours or until the beef is fork-tender. Baste the beef with the pan juices every 30 minutes. Remove the beef from the pan, cover and keep warm.\nStrain the pan drippings through a sieve into a medium bowl, reserving the garlic and discarding the thyme and rosemary sprigs. Spoon off any fat.\nPlace about half the garlic cloves and about 1 cup pan drippings into a food processor or blender. Cover and process until the mixture is smooth.\nHeat the garlic mixture, remaining garlic cloves, remaining pan drippings, chopped rosemary, minced garlic and lemon zest in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat to a boil.  Cook and stir until the gravy is thickened.  Serve the gravy with the beef.",
