    "des": "\"At a point of abundance with tomatoes and zucchini from my garden I came up with this soup. A friend said it was like a soup you would get at one of those chic 5 star restaurants! Serve with crusty French bread and salad. This soup tastes wonderful after a little cooking or simmering a long time. Sometimes I add cooked rice to give a bit more substance.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the zucchini and garlic in the skillet until lightly browned. Remove from heat, and set aside.\nIn a blender or food processor, puree the tomatoes, onion, and chile pepper, leaving a few small chunks.\nIn a large pot, mix the tomato puree and vegetable broth. Season with tarragon, dill, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and mix in the zucchini and garlic. Cover, and cook 45 minutes.",
