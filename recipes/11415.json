    "des": "\"A rolled cookie of Jewish ancestry! Whenever I travel to visit my grandchildren they beg me to bake these cookies. Chocolate chip rather than raisin filling is a big favorite in our family!  Adjust the amounts of cinnamon and sugar to suit your (or your grandchildren's) tastes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix butter or margarine, cottage cheese and flour together.\nRoll the dough into a circle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut the dough into triangular wedges. Sprinkle raisins into the broad end of the wedge along with cinnamon and sugar. Roll from the broad edge toward the pointed edge to form crescents. Sprinkle the crescents with cinnamon and sugar. Arrange the cookies on an ungreased baking sheet.\nBake for 12 minutes.",
