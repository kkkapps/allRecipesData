    "des": "\"This is an excellent way to can blueberries for a quick and easy pie.  It's virtually identical to the costly canned pie filling found in the grocery store.\"",
    "ins": "Place the blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and 8 cups of water into a large, non-reactive pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining 2 cups of water, and stir into the boiling blueberries until thickened. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.\nLadle into 7 sterilized quart jars with lids and rings. Process in a pressure canner for 5 minutes at 5 pounds of pressure.  Remove jars from the canner and place on cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press top of each lid with finger, ensuring that seal is tight (lid doesn't move up or down at all). Sealed jars can be stored for up to a year.",
