    "des": "\"This flavored simple syrup is very versatile and goes with so many things. I especially like to put it on top of French toast, in pancake or waffle batter, and it's very yummy in cornbread or biscuit batter. This can be made in advanced and stored and refrigerated in a glass jar.\"",

Increase heat to medium and bring a gentle boil, stirring often, until syrup is thickened, about 15 minutes.\nWhisk lemon juice into syrup; serve immediately or cool.",
