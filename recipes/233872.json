Cook bison sirloin steaks in hot oil for 16 to 18 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer registers 145 degrees F, turning once. Top each bison steak with 1 tablespoon of the pesto. Cover skillet and let stand for 3 minutes. Remove bison sirloin steaks from skillet and thinly slice.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Toss the cooked pasta, the remaining pesto, the tomatoes, and mozzarella in a large bowl. Serve with the sliced bison sirloin steaks. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with basil.",
