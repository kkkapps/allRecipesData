    "des": "\"These sugar cookies are very soft and fluffy for those of us who like them chewy, not hard or crisp.  Try substituting strawberry flavoring for the vanilla!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and baking powder, stir into the mixture alternately with the milk. Drop dough by spoonfuls or roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch in thickness.  Cut with cookie cutters into desired shapes. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
