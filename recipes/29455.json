Reserve a small amount to use as a basting sauce; the remainder is used as a marinade.\nPlace salmon fillets in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade, seal, and turn to coat salmon. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, turning once.\nPreheat grill for medium-high heat.\nLightly oil grill grate. Place salmon on grill, and discard marinade. Cook salmon for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until easily flaked with a fork. Baste with reserved sauce while grilling.",
