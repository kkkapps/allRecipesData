    "des": "\"A rich moist lemony cake, soaked with a rich lemon syrup after baking. This cake will last a week at room temperature, and it freezes well. It is also very good sliced and toasted.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nStir together the flour, salt, lemon zest and poppy seeds using a wire whisk. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Then stir in the dry ingredients. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.\nBake for 60 to 75 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\nTo make the syrup, combine 3/4 cup sugar with the lemon juice in a small saucepan, bring to a boil, then remove from heat and set aside to cool. When the cake is done, place the pan on a wire rack with a cookie sheet underneath. Prick the top of the cake several times with a toothpick or fork. Brush the top of the cake with the syrup, allowing lots of it to run down the sides and soak into the cake.\nAllow cake to cool slightly before removing from the pan to the wire rack to cool completely. When completely cooled, wrap the cake if foil or heavy plastic wrap and let it sit for 1 day before serving.",
