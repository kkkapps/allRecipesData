    "des": "\"Vegan meatballs. Super healthy, low calorie, and very versatile. The mix of grains and flours is very flexible - use whatever you have on hand. The seasonings could easily be altered to make this recipe suitable for any ethnicity. I usually serve them over spaghetti with a simple red sauce on top. You can make it into a meatloaf instead of meatballs.\"",

Add cornmeal, rolled oats, oat bran, ground flax seeds, Dijon mustard, steak seasoning, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, oregano, liquid smoke, brown sugar, and black pepper.\nPlace grated mushrooms in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until they soften and release their liquid, 3 to 5 minutes.
