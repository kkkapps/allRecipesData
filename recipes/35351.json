    "des": "\"I was inspired to make this dish after tasting something similar at an Italian restaurant in Ontario. It is a different type of pasta, having a great deal of flavour from the roasted pepper and sun-dried tomato, as well as being slightly dry from the cheese. I'm a picky eater and I love this dish!\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, red pepper and basil. Marinate 4 hours.\nPreheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Toss pasta with marinade until evenly coated. Spread into a baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Divide onto plates, top with grilled chicken, and sprinkle with goat cheese.",
