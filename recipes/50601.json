    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nHeat the oil in a skillet, and cook and stir the ground beef, onion, and green pepper over medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the meat is crumbly and no longer pink and the onion is translucent. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and stir in the condensed mushroom soup. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat.\nScoop the cheese sauce into a microwaveable bowl, and melt on low power for about 30 seconds.\nPlace the ground beef mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish, and spread an even layer of the melted cheese sauce over the ground beef. Top with frozen shoestring fries. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, until the fries are starting to turn golden.",
