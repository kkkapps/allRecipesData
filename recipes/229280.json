    "des": "\"Russians call it 'Korean Carrot Salad,' but it is so absolutely ubiquitous in Russia that if they didn't originally own it, they certainly do now. Coriander provides primary flavor; cayenne provides the heat. To get it right, you MUST use a mandoline to julienne the carrots into long, thin strands like spaghetti. To save time, buy them already julienned at the grocery store. This dish is best after it has marinated for 24 hours, but is fine after only 4 or 5 hours.\"",
    "ins": "Place carrots in a large bowl. Sprinkle garlic over carrots.\nMix vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a small bowl.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir coriander and cayenne pepper into the onion; add to carrot mixture and toss. Pour vinegar dressing over carrot mixture; toss to coat.\nTransfer carrot salad to a dish with a tight-fitting lid, cover, and refrigerate 4 to 24 hours, tossing salad several times while it marinates.",
