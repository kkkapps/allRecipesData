    "des": "\"This hearty soup is an anything-goes recipe! Try using carrots instead of red bell pepper; extra garlic, no problem! I love a lot of cilantro! Whatever your choice of veggies, it's wonderful and sure to please your family's tastebuds. At our house, I put a bottle of our favorite hot sauce on the table for those who like to spice up their tortilla soup. Garnish with Monterey Jack cheese and tortilla chips.\"",
