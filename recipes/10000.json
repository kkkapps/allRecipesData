    "des": "\"Excellent frozen. I have played with this over the years, and come up with several variations. At the holidays, I have added 1 teaspoon peppermint extract to the filling in lieu of the vanilla, and have also used crushed peppermint candy in the filling. I have also dipped them in chocolate, and coated them in confectioners' sugar.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, white sugar, cocoa powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and baking powder.  Stir in 1 1/2 cups milk, eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and shortening. Mix until smooth using an electric mixer. Drop batter by rounded teaspoons onto ungreased cookie sheets. Leave space, and only use a teaspoon; these spread.\nBake in preheated oven for 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from pan immediately, and cool on wire rack.\nTo make the filling, combine the butter, confectioners' sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, marshmallow creme, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla, and 1 tablespoon milk in a medium bowl. Beat with mixer until fluffy. Spread filling on one cookie, and top with another sandwich style.",
