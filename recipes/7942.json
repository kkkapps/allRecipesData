    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine and sift together 2 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, cocoa, salt, baking soda and baking powder.  In a small bowl, blend together eggs, oil, 1 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla; combine with dry ingredients.  Mix thoroughly and then stir in one cup cold coffee (may use instant coffee).  Batter will be very thin but it bakes into a rich, dark, moist cake.\nPour into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan.  Bake for about 40 minutes.\nTo Make Whipped Cream Frosting:  Combine 1/4 cup flour and 1 cup milk, adding milk slowly and beating until smooth.  Set over moderate heat and stir constantly until thickened.  Set aside to chill completely.  Combine 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2  cup shortening beating until light and fluffy; stir in well cooled flour-milk mixture and beat at high speed until thick and creamy.  Add 1 teaspoon vanilla and beat until thoroughly combined. Spread frosting over cooled cake. Enjoy!",
