    "des": "\"This recipe is used to make Awesome Tangerine-Glazed Turkey with Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing--or your favorite gravy. To make life easy on Thanksgiving Day, prepare this stock in advance. (Note: This stock can be made up to two days in advance. Allow stock to cool completely, uncovered. Keep chilled in an airtight container, in refrigerator, until ready to use).\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan, combine the neck and giblets (excluding the liver), 6 cups water, celery, carrot, onion, tangerine zest, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, skimming the froth occasionally, for 1 hour. Add liver and continue to cook at a bare simmer for an additional 30 minutes.\nStrain the stock through a fine sieve into a bowl. Reserve the liver for Awesome Sausage, Apple and Dried Cranberry Stuffing (see Cook's Note). Reserve the neck and remaining giblets for the gravy. There should be about 3 cups of stock. If there is more, simmer the stock until it is reduced to about 3 cups; if there is less, add enough water to measure about 3 cups.",
