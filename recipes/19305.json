    "des": "\"This is a light and garlicky spaghetti sauce.  This is delicious and easy to prepare!  A variation on the original garlic spaghetti.  I like to serve it with a glass of red wine.  My husband's favorite! Serve with a heated sourdough baguette and dip in 6 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar if desired.\"",
