    "des": "\"This recipe gets its name from a story that I read to my son about a princess whose only wish is to find a prince that can make a cookie that is as tiny and delicate as she is. This is a delicious little lemon cookie that will not disappoint! They can either be drizzled with a lemon glaze made of confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice, or rolled in sugar before baking for a more subtle lemon flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until creamy, about 5 minutes, then beat in eggs, one at a time, incorporating each before adding the next. Beat in the lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Gently mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Chill the dough about 30 minutes.\nScoop up about 1 1/2 teaspoon of dough per cookie, gently form into a ball, and place the balls onto baking sheets about 2 inches apart.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cookies are set and just beginning to brown at the edges, about 8 minutes; cool on baking sheets for 1 minute before removing to finish cooling on racks.",
