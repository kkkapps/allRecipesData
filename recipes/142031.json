    "ins": "Preheat oven to broil.\nArrange the habanero and Anaheim chile peppers on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Watch carefully and broil just until the skin blackens and blisters, about 3 minutes for the habanero pepper. Remove habanero pepper. Turn the Anaheim peppers and continue broiling until all sides are done. When completed, place peppers in a sealed paper bag to steam. After 15 to 20 minutes, remove peppers from the bag and peel the skin off each one. Remove stems and seeds from the Anaheim peppers. Finely chop the peppers and place in a large bowl.\nCombine the avocados, tomatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, and lime juice with the pepper mixture. Season with salt and black pepper. Chill 1 hour before serving.",
