    "des": "\"I wanted something a little different from the standard Russian tea cakes recipe, and I came up with this. These are easy to make yet elegant. I prefer them with unsalted butter, but some people like the salted butter better.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCream together the butter and 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar until smooth in a bowl. Stir in the poppy seeds and vanilla extract. Stir in the flour until just combined. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls, and place 1 inch apart onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from baking sheet to cool slightly, then roll warm cookies in the remaining 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar until coated. Cool completely on wire racks, then roll in sugar once more.",
