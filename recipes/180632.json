    "des": "\"Fresh scallops breaded with crackers and Parmesan cheese are quick, easy, and mouth watering. \"",
    "ins": "Combine the cracker crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a  zip-top bag.  Shake bag to mix well.\nPlace scallops in a small bowl and pour cream over.  Stir to fully coat scallops.\nOne at a time, drop the cream coated scallops into the cracker crumb mixture.  Gently press scallop into the crumbs to coat and shake off any excess.  Place the breaded scallops onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.\nHeat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  When butter is hot and frothy, add the scallops, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Cook scallops, covered, until crispy on the outside and just cooked through on the inside, about 2 minutes per side. Cook in 2 batches if necessary.  Serve immediately.",
