Reduce heat to medium and stir in butter and arrowroot powder to thicken the stew.\nWhisk eggs in a small bowl.\nIncrease heat to medium-high to bring stew to an active simmer. Remove from heat. Drizzle eggs in slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon until cooked through, about 1 minute. Stir in parsley.",
