    "des": "\"Whole30\u00c2\u00ae-compliant dessert! For a finer and less gritty curd, strain through a fine mesh sieve before refrigerating. You can add 1/4 cup of honey (when you add the eggs) and it would definitely kick up the sweetness factor. This hit the spot for me since I was looking for tangy, mildly sweet and salty.\"",
    "ins": "Stir tangerine juice and lemon juice together in a saucepan. Whisk eggs and egg yolk into juice mixture until smooth.\nHeat juice mixture over medium-low heat. Whisk in 3 tablespoons coconut oil until well-combined. Add remaining coconut oil and cook, whisking constantly, until curd begins to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Spoon curd into small bowls or jars.\nCook and stir coconut flakes in a small skillet over medium heat until lightly golden and toasted, 2 to 5 minutes. Season with salt. Top curd with coconut flakes and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.",
