    "des": "\"This pudding is super easy to make, a great dish to bring along for a pot luck, and can be served warm, cold, or reheated. It was my late Mom's recipe that she brought to everyone's home. She was always begged by family and friends to PLEASE make this. It was, and still is, a staple at the holiday table for us.\"",
