Although the ingredients are not necessarily 'figure friendly' they are a good way to get your kids to get their protein, and fruits all in one meal item. You can substitute your favorite types of bread, meat and cheese.\"",

Top each one with a slice of cheese and a second slice of bread.\nMelt butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Whisk together eggs and milk in a small bowl. Quickly dip both sides of the sandwich into the egg mixture. Fry sandwiches in pan for 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Watch carefully. You want the sandwiches to be golden in color and the egg to be cooked.",
