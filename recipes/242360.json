    "des": "\"I was brainstorming some ideas for using up a cup of nearly perfect blueberries, and was waffling between muffins, donuts, and biscuits. I finally decided on a biscuit-like triangle, spiced subtly with essence of old-fashioned donut. I'm calling it a scone because I cut it into a triangle.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with silicone mat or parchment paper.\nWhisk together flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a mixing bowl. Mix in sugar.\nGrate frozen butter into dry mixture with a cheese grater, tossing occasionally to prevent butter pieces from clumping together. Mixture should resemble coarse crumbs. If necessary, rub mixture between your fingers to break it down a bit more. Add blueberries and toss to distribute evenly. Stir buttermilk into dry mixture and stir just until dough is moistened.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, for 5 or 6 turns. Pat or roll the dough out into a 1 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Cut dough into 4 equal rectangles. Cut each small rectangle diagonally into triangles. Transfer scones onto prepared baking sheet. Brush tops with buttermilk, and sprinkle with a pinch of demerara sugar.\nBake scones in preheated oven until they are well browned and blueberry juices are bubbling through surface, about 25 minutes. Let cool before serving.",
