    "des": "\"(Aka Spanish Spaghetti or Noodle Paella) Pronounced 'Feed-wa'. I heard of this variation of paella that used noodles instead of rice. I am a big fan of paella and wanted to try it, but couldn't find a recipe. This is my version of fideua. It turned out awesome and a lot faster to cook than paella. I made mine in a 10\u00e2\u20ac\u009d cast iron skillet, and made enough to feed about 4 peeps.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the chicken stock, garlic, and saffron in a saucepan. Warm until hot, but not too hot to put your finger in. Cover, and keep warm over low heat so the saffron can infuse while you continue with the recipe.\nCook and stir the diced pancetta in a cast iron skillet over medium heat until most of the fat has rendered out and the pancetta has cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 10 minutes. Once done, remove the pancetta and set aside.\nDiscard the grease and pour in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook and stir the carrots, artichoke hearts, and green beans until the vegetables begin to soften, then remove from the pan and set aside. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the skillet, and stir in the onion. Season with salt and pepper, and cook until the onion has softened, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, and cook until the tomato-onion mixture is practically a paste, 15 to 20 minutes.\nSpread the onion mixture evenly over the bottom of the skillet, and sprinkle evenly with the broken spaghetti pieces. Pour in enough saffron broth to cover the noodles, then arrange the pancetta and cooked vegetables over top. Add additional saffron broth as needed to cover the vegetables. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the noodles are tender, about 15 minutes.",
