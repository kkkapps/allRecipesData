    "ins": "Peel the onions and half lengthwise.  Thinly slice onion halves.  Place onion in a bowl of ice water, and let soak for 5 minutes.  Drain well in colander.\nIn a large heatproof bowl, toss together the green and red cabbage, onion, carrot and vinegar.\nIn a small skillet, heat the olive oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Add the caraway and mustard seeds, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the mustard seeds stop popping.  Drizzle the hot oil mixture immediately over the cabbage mixture and toss the coleslaw well.  Add salt to taste and toss again.",
