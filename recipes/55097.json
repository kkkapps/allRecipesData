    "des": "\"Warm melted brie oozes out of a crispy breadcrumb coating when you bite into these pieces of heaven.  Serve with cranberry sauce and a small side salad and you have the perfect dinner appetizer or snack.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, whisk the egg with some salt and pepper using a fork. Place the bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Dip the cubes of Brie into the egg, then roll in breadcrumbs until evenly coated and well covered. Place the cheese cubes on a tray, and refrigerate for about 20 minutes, to firm up.\nHeat oil in deep-fryer or heavy saucepan  to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the cheese cubes for 3 to 5 minutes, until deep golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels. Serve warm with cranberry sauce for dipping. You can also make these before your guests arrive, and keep them in a warm oven.",
