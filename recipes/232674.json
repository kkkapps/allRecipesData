    "des": "\"I have to eat gluten free. My husband doesn't have to but he does. When I make the food homemade it is so much like what we have always known that it isn't a hardship. This is a lovely, moist pumpkin raisin bread. I use Better Batter\u00c2\u00ae Gluten-Free all-purpose flour. I measure by weight and that has made all the difference! I refuse to use bean flour mixes; who wants bean flavor in their sweets? Let it cool completely or it will not hold together. Once it is cooled you can slice and serve. Enjoy!\"",

Add pumpkin, eggs, buttermilk, and maple syrup; beat into the sugar mixture. Stir flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and cloves together in a separate bowl; blend into the pumpkin mixture. Fold raisins into the resulting batter; pour into prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
