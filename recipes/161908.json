    "des": "\"Mussels are topped with a rich curry butter, sealed in foil packets, and grilled until done in this terrific recipe. They're so delicious! I serve these as an appetizer with warm, crusty bread for dunking followed by a big green salad topped with grilled chicken or shrimp for an easy summertime meal.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high medium-heat and lightly oil grate.\nWhisk together the butter, garlic, curry powder, cumin, and salt in a small bowl.\nArrange four large sheets of aluminum foil on a flat surface. Divide the mussels into four even portions and place one portion on each piece of foil. Dot the mussels with the curry mixture. Sprinkle the red bell pepper and parsley over the top of each portion. Top each with lime slices. Wrap foil tightly around the portions.\nCook the packets on the preheated grill until the mussels have opened, 5 to 10 minutes. Discard any mussels which do not open.\nTransfer the mussels to small bowls and garnish each with a lime wedge to serve.",
