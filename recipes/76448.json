    "des": "\"A yummy breakfast treat, and very easy to make!! Serve with bacon or sausage, and some fried eggs, wonderful!!! Batter will keep in fridge for a couple of days if you can't make all at once, or you can freeze and make at a later date.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, butter and buttermilk. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and sugar; stir into the wet ingredients just until blended. Adjust the thickness of the batter to your liking by adding more flour or buttermilk if necessary.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side. Continue with remaining batter.",
