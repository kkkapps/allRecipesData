    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix ground beef, ground turkey, Italian sausage, vegetable soup, eggs, bread crumbs, barbeque sauce, ketchup, yellow mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, browning sauce, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Form into a loaf and place meat loaf into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until meat loaf is browned and no longer pink inside, 60 to 75 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let meat loaf rest for 10 minutes before cutting into 1/2-inch thick slices.",
