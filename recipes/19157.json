    "des": "\"My aunt gave me this recipe ten years ago, when we were celebrating Christmas at her house. I have made it every year since then, and now  my family considers it one of our traditions. The secret ingredient is baby food. This looks so pretty on the table. The color is fabulous. It's also great for Thanksgiving.\"",
