    "des": "\"A cool shrimp salad with asparagus and artichokes.  Canned artichoke hearts are fine, but fresh cooked can be great.\"",
    "ins": "Cook the asparagus in boiling salted water until tender. Remove and cool under cold water. Reserve six stalks and cut remaining asparagus into 1 inch pieces.\nCook and clean shrimp. Again reserve the best six and dice the remainder. In a bowl, combine shrimp and asparagus, mix gently with mayonnaise and lemon juice.\nIn a separate bowl, marinate the artichoke hearts in 1 cup French dressing.\nPlace shrimp and asparagus in an attractive shallow bowl. Garnish with sieved egg and arrange reserved asparagus on top to resemble the spokes of a wheel.\nDrain the artichoke bottoms and garnish each with a dollop of mayonnaise, 1 whole shrimp  and 1 parsley sprig. Arrange them around the salad.",
