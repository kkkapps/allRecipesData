    "des": "\"A spicy addition to a classic soup. I normally make this with a whole chicken and let it cook for an hour, remove the meat, and return the bones for another hour on their own, chicken breasts are used here for simplicity.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken, onion, and crushed garlic cloves; cook in hot oil until chicken breast is browned and onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes . Pour water, white wine, and lemon juice over the chicken mixture; stir sliced ginger, peppercorns, chicken bouillon, bay leaves, and white sugar into the liquid. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 45 minutes.\nRemove and discard the crushed garlic cloves. Remove chicken breasts from the soup to a cutting board; chop into bite-size pieces.\nAdd carrot, celery, kohlrabi, rosemary, and thyme to the soup. Reduce heat to low until the vegetables begin to soften, about 20 minutes.\nBring the soup to a boil. Return chopped chicken to the soup along with the egg noodles, minced garlic, and grated ginger; remove the pot from heat and let sit until the noodles have softened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Garnish with parsley.",
