    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the chicken, onion, green pepper, mushrooms, and garlic until the chicken is no longer pink inside, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, parsley, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and basil, bring the mixture to a boil, and reduce heat. Cover the skillet and simmer for 30 minutes.\nWhile the chicken mixture is simmering, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nServe the chicken cacciatore over the hot cooked noodles. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese before serving.",
