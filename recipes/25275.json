    "ins": "In a large saucepan bring water to a boil.  Rinse rice; stir into boiling water. Boil just until rice rises to the surface of the water. Drain rice and return it to the saucepan.  Stir in the oil and water. Mix in the dill, parsley, cilantro, fava beans, turmeric, cinnamon, salt and pepper.\nCook the rice over medium heat for 5 minutes.\nReduce heat to the lowest setting. Cover and simmer for 40 to 45 minutes.  Note:  It's normal to end up with crispy rice (called Tadig) on the bottom of the pot after cooking; it's delicious.",
