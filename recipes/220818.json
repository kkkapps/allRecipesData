    "des": "\"Best blueberry pie ever created by my friend Patsy. Most blueberry pies lose the depth of taste of the original fruit and dissolve into sweetness. This one explodes with fresh blueberry flavor. Top with fresh cut strawberries and whipped cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPress pie crust dough into a pie pan. Poke small holes into dough with a fork.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature.\nPlace cream cheese in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave on High to soften, about 20 seconds.\nSpread softened cream cheese in the bottom of cooled crust.\nLayer 2 1/2 cups blueberries over the cream cheese.\nWhisk cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl until dissolved.\nStir cornstarch mixture, 2 1/2 cups blueberries, sugar, and lemon zest in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPour the thickened blueberry mixture over the raw blueberries in the pie crust and spread evenly.\nCool pie in refrigerator until set, at least 1 hour.",
