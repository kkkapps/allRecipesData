    "des": "\"This soup can be served hot or cold, and is great to use up those giant zucchinis from the garden! This soup can easily be adjusted to your personal tastes.  If you want a thicker soup you can cut back on the tomatoes and add a little more zucchini. Serve with Parmesan cheese.\n\"",
    "ins": "Place zucchini cubes in colander; sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of salt and let stand to drain for 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine in a blender the roma tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, and water; blend until smooth.\nPour tomato mixture and chicken broth into a large stockpot. Bring to a boil over medium heat; immediately reduce heat to low; stir in sugar and simmer, stirring occasionally.\nMeanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Stir in garlic, onion, green pepper, and zucchini, and cook and stir until onion is clear and zucchini is lightly brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer vegetables to blender and pulse a few times, just enough to chop.\nAdd vegetables to the stockpot; stir in lemon juice, dill, tarragon, and parsley.  Simmer, uncovered, for 35 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to taste.  Simmer an additional five minutes. Let stand for ten minutes before serving.",
