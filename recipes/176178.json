    "des": "\"I take bat wings to Halloween parties, angel wings to Christmas parties, and so on. They are just fab and easy with only 3 ingredients. My boyfriend loves to tweak this recipe. However, I just love this simple basic recipe and I hope you do, too. It's better if you can marinate this overnight. I put it in gallon sealable bag and keep in refrigerator then pour in pan the next day.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); prepare a 9x13 inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.\nWhisk together the sugar, soy sauce, and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Arrange the wings in the bottom of the prepared dish; pour the soy sauce mixture evenly over the wings.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; turn the wings over with a spatula and cook another 20 minutes.",
