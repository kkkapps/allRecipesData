    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the linguine, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes.\nMelt half of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and artichokes; cook and stir for a few minutes. When the mushrooms start to brown, stir in the garlic, and cook until fragrant and lightly browned.\nStir in the escargot, and season with sage and oregano. Cook for just a few minutes, as the escargot cooks really fast like shrimp. Add about half of the Parmesan cheese, and remove from the heat. Serve over linguine with remaining Parmesan cheese.",
