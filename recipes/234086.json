    "des": "\"When meatballs are gone, you can do shots of the sauce... Gotta admit, I usually cheat on the meatballs and buy 'em pre-cooked, or ya can make yer own. I make several batches of this and keep 'em in the freezer letting them ferment, although cuz of the alcohol content they don't freeze solid, LOL. All ingredients are to taste, no exact measuring is required... How much you make is optional. Be creative and have fun, do a shot.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpread meatballs in a single layer in a shallow baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until hot, about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile heat apple jelly and jalapeno pepper jelly in a saucepan over medium heat until melted, about 5 minutes. Stir roasted peppers into jelly mixture and remove from heat. Add whiskey; stir until sauce is combined.\nStir hot meatballs into whiskey sauce. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\nHeat meatballs and sauce slowly over low heat until completely hot, being careful not to boil, 15 to 20 minutes.",
