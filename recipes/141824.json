    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nSift the cake flour and salt into a bowl. Cream the butter with 1 1/3 cups sugar in a large mixing bowl until light colored and fluffy. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla until well blended. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, alternating with the flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake cake in preheated oven until top springs back when lightly touched, or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool cake 15 minutes before turning out of pan.\nMeanwhile, place strawberries in a separate bowl. Toss gently with 1/3 cup sugar, cover, and refrigerate until needed.\nCombine the yogurt, heavy cream, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl, and stir until well blended. To serve, top slices of cake with strawberries and a dollop of the cream mixture.",
