    "des": "\"One of Grandma Dorothy's much sought after recipes.  These oatmeal cookies are wonderfully chewy and are made with oil instead of butter or margarine so they appeal to the heath conscious.  One is never enough!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, salt, white sugar, brown sugar, oats and coconut. Make a well in the center and pour in the oil, eggs and vanilla. Mix well using your hands or a wooden spoon. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten slightly with a fork.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, cookies should be a very light brown and chewy - not crisp. Cool for a couple of minutes on the baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
