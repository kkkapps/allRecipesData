    "des": "\"This is just the base for a basic pepperoni pizza roll. I made this with leftover pizza toppings.  I didn't feel like making any dough so I substituted egg roll wraps.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl.\nCombine the pizza sauce and pepperoni in a blender or food processor.  Process until pepperoni is well chopped and the sauce has thickened. Transfer sauce to a large bowl, and stir in mozzarella.\nLay out one eggroll wrapper on work surface.  Place 1 tablespoon filling at the bottom center of the wrapper, leaving 1/2 inch border on each side.  Lightly brush the wrapper edges with the egg mixture.  Fold over both sides; roll up to encase filling in wrapper.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.\nDeep fry pizza rolls in batches until crisp and golden brown, 5-9 minutes.",
