The only 'cooking' involved is melting the chocolate. If you don't want to take the time to melt the chocolate, they sell chocolate icing in piping bags already for cakes and cookies. You can buy those for easy use, especially if this is for kids.\"",
    "ins": "Spread about 1 tablespoon marshmallow fluff evenly onto 1 side of each graham cracker square.\nMelt chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Cool chocolate for 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon chocolate into a piping bag or a plastic bag with a corner snipped.\nPipe chocolate in the shape of a spider web onto the marshmallow fluff of each graham cracker. Put a dot with some legs in the corner to represent a spider.",
