    "des": "\"This is a quick and easy version of German Bierocks; dough filled with cabbage, hamburger, and onions. They can then be baked or fried. If you have your own roll recipe they are even better.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in ground beef, and cook until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in chopped onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes more. Add the chopped cabbage; cook and stir until the cabbage has softened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then spread the mixture onto a baking sheet to cool until cool enough to handle.\nOnce the mixture has cooled, flatten a dinner roll, and place several tablespoons of the cabbage mixture in the center. Pull the edges of the dough over the filling and pinch to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.\nHeat the oil in a deep-fryer or electric skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFry bierocks a few at a time in the preheated oil on both sides until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes; drain on paper towels.",
