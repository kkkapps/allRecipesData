    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMelt butter in a heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Add onions and salt; cook and stir until onions have softened up and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, ancho chili powder, and chipotle chili powder; cook and stir about 1 minute. Add tomato paste; cook and stir about 2 minutes over medium heat. Add oregano and drained farro. Stir until farro is completely coated with the spice/butter mixture, about 2 minutes.\nPour in chicken broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. As soon as mixture starts to bubble, stir, and cover. Remove from heat.\nPlace pan in preheated oven and bake until farro is tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Fluff grains with a fork.",
