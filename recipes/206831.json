Cut the asparagus into 2 inch pieces.\nCook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings in the skillet. Add the crabmeat to the hot bacon drippings and cook until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl; add the asparagus, tomatoes, and hearts of palm.\nWhisk the lemon juice, olive oil, and 1 minced clove garlic together in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Sprinkle the bacon over the salad just before serving.",
