    "des": "\"This recipe makes three rolls of dough, which can be frozen until ready to bake.\"",
    "ins": "Cream the butter and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Sift the cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and flour together in a second mixing bowl. Slowly stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture until evenly blended.\nDivide the dough evenly into three portions and place each on a square of waxed paper. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, make the filling by combine the dates, pecans, water and white sugar in a saucepan set over low heat.  Cook and stir until the filling has a paste-like consistency. Cool slightly.\nWorking with one portion at a time, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to make a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread 1/3 of the filling evenly over the dough; roll up to make a log.  Repeat the process with the remaining dough. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets.\nUsing a sharp, serrated knife, cut the rolls into 1/4 inch slices. Place the slices on prepared baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until set and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool on racks.",
