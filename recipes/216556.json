    "des": "\"This is a recipe my boss handed down to me, and I have made these cranberries for every Christmas and Thanksgiving for the last 10 years. I always pour this into a beautiful glass dish after it has cooled before it goes into the refrigerator. It has a beautiful look.\"",
    "ins": "Stir the cranberry juice concentrate and sugar together in a saucepan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Mix in the fresh and dried cranberries, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the dried cranberries soften and the fresh ones pop, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.\nMix in the orange marmalade, orange juice, orange peel, and allspice until thoroughly combined. Allow the cranberry sauce to cool completely. Pour into glass serving dish, cover, and chill until cold, at least 2 hours. Can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and refrigerated until serving.",
