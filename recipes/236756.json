    "ins": "Whisk 2 cups flour and salt together in a large bowl; cut in lard with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles peas. Add 1/4 cup cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until mixture is moistened just enough to form a ball when squeezed. Divide dough into two pieces, form each into a ball, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.\nPlace berries and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer berries until tender, about 10 minutes.\nWhisk sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons flour, and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Stir sugar mixture into berries, return to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until filling is clear, about 2 minutes; stir in lemon juice. Cool filling to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nRoll one ball of pastry out on a lightly floured surface to fit an 8-inch pie plate; line pie plate with crust. Pour berry mixture into pie crust; dot with butter. Roll remaining pastry out for top crust, place over filled pie, and crimp edges tightly together.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 35 minutes.",
