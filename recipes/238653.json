    "des": "\"I love sriracha and using it to replace the conventional Tabasco\u00c2\u00ae hot sauce in my go-to Bloody Mary recipe creates an equally quenching, but slightly brighter and spicier cocktail. For more fire, substitute with habanero chiles or pepper vodka. Garnish with celery ribs, pickled asparagus, and green olives.\"",
