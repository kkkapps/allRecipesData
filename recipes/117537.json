    "des": "\"Make easy and quick meals with canned venison in stews, soups, sandwiches, or just heat and serve with rice, potatoes, or noodles and vegetable. The meat can be warmed and eaten as is or used in stews, chili or hot dishes or in sandwiches. Use the scaling feature to scale this recipe to the number of pounds of venison you have to can.\"",
    "ins": "Place the venison into a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic; toss to combine. Place venison into canning jar along with onion and bell pepper. Jars should be filled to within 1/2 inch of the top. Wipe rim with a clean, damp cloth, and seal with lid and ring.\nPlace jar into a pressure canner filled with water according to manufacturer's directions. Affix lid and bring to a boil with the pressure valve open. Boil for 5 minutes before closing the pressure valve. Bring to a pressure of 10 psi, then reduce heat in order to maintain this pressure. Process for 75 minutes, watching gauge closely so the pressure stays at 10 psi. After 75 minutes, turn off heat and allow the canner to cool until the gauge reads 0 psi.\nOnce the pressure has subsided and the canner is safe to open, remove the jar to cool on a rack. The jar will seal with a pop as it cools; refrigerate the jar if it does not seal. Properly sealed jars may be stored in a cool, dark area.",
