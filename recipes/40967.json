    "des": "\"This recipe is spiced up using Asian chili paste - sambal belachan - doesn't taste as good if you omit it! Salmon, clams, mussels, etc. may be used in place of squid.\"",

Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nLightly grease the banana leaf. Wrap squid in the leaf, and place on the prepared grill. Cook 10 to 15 minutes, until leaf is slightly charred and squid is opaque.",
