    "des": "\"Creamy vanilla pudding, hearty graham crackers, and rich chocolate frosting make this THE MOST awesome dessert. I keep the recipe copied because everyone always wants it when I take it somewhere. The MOST important part of this dessert is waiting about 24 hours to serve it...the crackers need time to absorb the pudding mixture, and it truly makes a difference in the taste if you don't wait!\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine pudding mix and confectioners' sugar. Whisk in milk until mixture is smooth, then gradually fold in whipped topping.\nPlace a layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Spread 1/3 of pudding mixture over crackers. Cover pudding with another layer of graham crackers. Continue layering until pudding mixture is gone. Cover last pudding layer with another layer of graham crackers.\nRemove lid and seal from frosting and microwave at 20 second intervals, stirring between intervals, until frosting is pourable (about 1 minute). Spread frosting evenly over top layer of graham crackers. Refrigerate 24 hours before serving.",
