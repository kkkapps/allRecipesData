    "des": "\"Incredibly simple yet outrageously tasty; sour cream makes them super moist and tender. Reminiscent of the original Kentucky Fried Chicken\u00c2\u00ae biscuits, but much better! Great with all kinds of meals but they make an especially fantastic biscuits and gravy breakfast (or lunch or dinner).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread melted butter all over a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nStir baking mix, lemon-lime soda, sour cream, and softened butter together in a bowl until dough is well-mixed; knead with your hands, adding more baking mix as necessary, until dough is smooth but still sticky.\nRoll dough into 15 equal-size balls and place dough balls in prepared baking dish, turning to coat each completely in melted butter.\nBake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.",
