    "des": "\"Valentine's Day is special for us because it is our wedding anniversary as well!  Though this isn't a standard 'romantic' recipe, every time I prepare this dish the love flows freely!  It is a way to show my husband I love him -- it is his favorite, but not mine.  Every time I serve it my husband showers me with compliments, affection, and love because he knows it's my way of saying I love you any day of the week, not just Valentine's Day.\"",
