Remove to a paper towel to drain any excess grease.\nRoll up the crescent rolls according to your package instructions and line them up in the casserole dish (it is okay if they touch).\nWhisk together the eggs, milk, apple butter and optional cheese.\nScatter the cooked sausage over the top of the crescent rolls in the dish. Pour the egg mixture over the top.\nBake for 35-40 minutes or until the eggs have completely set in the center.",
