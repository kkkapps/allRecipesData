    "des": "\"With an abundance of zucchini from the garden in the summer, our family collected many recipes while I was growing up. This one has been in our family for about 40 years and is a favorite to eat cold as a snack on some great crunchy chips or crackers. The addition of the cider vinegar and curry powder makes this recipe completely different from the traditional French version.\"",
