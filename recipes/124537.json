    "des": "\"IT WAS probably 45 years ago when the thrashers came to dinner at our house and Mother served this bread. Today, every time I bake it, I get nostalgic for those days.    My parents were emigrants from Czechoslovakia and couldn't speak English very well. The thrashers hardly talked anyway - they were too busy enjoying Mother's delicious food! -Millie Feather, Baroda, Michigan\"",
    "ins": "In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Add brown sugar, caraway, oil, salt and remaining water; mix well. Stir in rye flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; divide in half. Shape each half into a ball; place in two greased 8-in. round cake pans. Flatten balls to a 6-in. diameter. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.",
