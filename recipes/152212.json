    "des": "\"I made this as a fluke once because I needed to go shopping and these ingredients were all I had. My kids loved it; I did, too. Now it's a family recipe that I cook from time to time. This is hearty, slightly-sweet, and a great holiday treat or an awesome side dish. Experiment adding other ingredients like pecans or raisins to make it your own.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the rice and water in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil; cover and reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until the water is completely absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.\nStir together the pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, brown sugar, butter, and salt in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until warm. Stir pumpkin mixture into cooked rice.",
