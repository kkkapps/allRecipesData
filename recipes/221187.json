    "des": "\"This dessert pizza pairs nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a cup of vanilla coffee, or a tall glass of cold milk! I made this for my son's high school graduation, for Reese's\u00c2\u00ae Peanut Butter Cups are his favorite! I wanted to do something different, so I thought why not make a dessert pizza from his favorite treat? I just hope I can control myself around this dessert now!\"",
