    "des": "\"Red cabbage with apples is a traditional German side dish for pork roast and other roasts, Christmas goose, turkey, and game. It tastes even better when reheated so I usually make it the day before.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large pan. Add sugar and stir until it has a light caramel color, about 5 minutes. Add onion and apples; cook and stir until the onions start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.\nStir in broth, apple cider vinegar, and salt. Cover and simmer until flavors are well combined, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and stir in lingonberry jam towards the end of the cooking time if desired.",
