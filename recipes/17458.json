    "des": "\"I whipped this delicious soup up on a chilly day when a friend and I both craved our favorite cold weather combo, grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup. Although it only takes a minute to throw together, this soup tastes anything but ordinary. Enjoy! The tortellini is actually half of a 9 ounce package.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare soup in a medium saucepan according to package directions. Add the oregano, basil, parsley and ground black pepper, stirring well, over medium heat. Simmer for 5 minutes, reduce heat to low and add the tortellini. Continue to simmer for 5 more minutes, or until tortellini is cooked.",
