    "des": "\"Shrimp and sun-dried tomatoes are cooked in a light garlic and olive oil sauce.  Great over pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nMeanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the shrimp and onion; cook and stir until the shrimp are beginning to turn pink, about 2 minutes. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic. Continue cooking until the shrimp are no longer opaque in the center and the onion has turned translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in the parsley and cilantro, and pour over pasta to serve.",
