    "des": "\"Baked sweet potatoes are topped with slow cooked caramelized onions and red bell peppers. Serve with a dollop of sour cream or plain yogurt. Use large sweet potatoes for a delicious meatless main dish.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Scrub and dry the sweet potatoes, then prick several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the sweet potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and bell pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 20 to 30 minutes more.\nSplit open the baked sweet potatoes and top with the onion mixture, salt, pepper, and a dollop of sour cream.",
