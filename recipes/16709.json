    "des": "\"Easy, tasty fried chicken! I love this recipe. I made it up by reading various seasoning labels at the grocery store and trying the ones for poultry. This was my favorite. It is heavenly chicken and melts in your mouth. The seasoning amounts are approximate, add as little or as much as you desire (I like a lot).\"",
    "ins": "Rinse chicken and pat dry. Put flour in a shallow dish or bowl and roll chicken in flour.\nHeat shortening in a large skillet over medium heat. Add floured chicken and sprinkle with savory and seasoning. Fry for about 20 minutes each side; I fry on three sides, so it takes about 60 minutes (1 hour).",
