    "des": "\"A twist on an Italian favorite. Ladyfingers are layered in a dish with raspberries and mascarpone filling.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine raspberries with 6 tablespoons sugar. Crush a few of the berries; set aside. In a small bowl, dissolve 1 cup sugar in 1/3 cup hot water. When dissolved, stir in Grand Marnier and cold water; set aside.\nBeat egg yolks with 6 tablespoons sugar until ribbons form, about 5 minutes. mix in mascarpone until smooth. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, with clean beaters, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 6 tablespoons sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the mascarpone mixture, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.\nBrush ladyfingers on both sides with Grand Marnier syrup. Place on bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch glass baking dish. Spoon raspberries evenly over ladyfingers. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the raspberries. Sprinkle chocolate shavings over cream, then cover with the remaining cream mixture. Top with toasted almonds. Cover with plastic, and refrigerate overnight.",
