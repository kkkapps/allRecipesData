    "des": "\"Chewy, nutty, chocolaty, and packed with tasty energy, no one will ever know these bars are low-fat and healthy! They're very easy to make and you can pack in everyone's favorite nuts and fruits. My family has now stopped buying Kashi\u00c2\u00ae and chewy bars because we love these so much. These are gluten-free when made with rice flour and appear to be professionally made thanks to the small spoonful of corn syrup that keeps everything tightly combined and gives the bars a nice shine. Have fun experimenting with different combinations of nuts, dried fruits, and toppings! Almond butter works well, too!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish.\nStir peanut butter and melted butter together in a bowl until smooth. Add brown sugar, honey, corn syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt; stir. Mix applesauce into peanut butter mixture.\nCombine oats and flour in a bowl; toss to coat oats with flour. Stir peanuts and raisins into oat mixture. Pour peanut butter mixture over the oat mixture; stir to coat completely. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Sprinkle chocolate chips over the top and continue baking until chocolate melts and edges begin to brown, about 5 minutes more. Spread melted chocolate chips with the back of a spoon or a rubber spatula to coat the top. Cool completely before cutting into bars.",
