    "des": "\"This was the best tasting iced coffee I've ever had. Since the flavors are extracted without heat, the results are a smoother, less acidic, less bitter product. You can use the coffee concentrate straight on ice cream or gelato for a classic Italian treat \u00c2\u2013 affogato.\"",

Whisk, then strain through a funnel lined with a moistened paper towel into a bowl.\nPlace ice cream scoops in 2 coffee or espresso cups. Pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup cold coffee over the top of each. Garnish with shaved dark chocolate.",
