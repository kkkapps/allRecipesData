Add water, ham bone, and chicken bouillon; simmer until meat falls off the bone, about 1 hour. Transfer ham bone to a cutting board and allow to cool slightly.\nStir beans and potatoes into ham broth and simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut ham into bite-size pieces and return to the pot. Add tortellini to the ham and bean soup; simmer until pasta is tender, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir zucchini and parsley into soup and continue to simmer until zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes more.\nDivide soup into bowls and garnish with Parmesan cheese and black pepper.",
