    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Stir in the bacon and saute just to render the fat out of the bacon; do not cook till crisp. Then add the onions, shallots, leek, celery and garlic and saute for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.\nThen, add the beans, carrots, turnip and cabbage along with enough vegetable stock to cover (about 4 quarts). Let simmer for 2 hours, or until vegetables are to desired tenderness. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
