    "des": "\"After years of experimenting with different cooking methods for a standing rib roast, I've finally perfected our Christmas dinner. Dry-brining the prime rib the day before roasting means every bite is flavorful, and slow-roasting at a low temperature followed by a high-heat sear ensures a delicious medium-rare doneness throughout with a savory herb crust.\"",
    "ins": "Season roast generously with kosher salt. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nRemove roast from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nMix butter, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper together in a small bowl; spread butter mixture over roast. Place roast in a large roasting pan.\nBake roast in the preheated oven until internal temperature reaches 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) for medium-rare, about 3 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and tent with aluminum foil; allow to rest, about 20 minutes.\nIncrease oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Uncover roast.\nReturn roast to the oven and bake until well-browned, 6 to 10 minutes. Slice and serve.",
