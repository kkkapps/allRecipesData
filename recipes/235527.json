    "ins": "Sift flour, powdered milk, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and baking soda together in a bowl. Whisk apple cider,  1/4 cup vegetable oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Stir apple cider mixture into flour mixture until batter is just combined.\nHeat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
