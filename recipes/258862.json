    "des": "\"This pasta dish is velvety and creamy, unlike any Alfredo. It is an excellent base for a plethora of add-ons like shrimp, grilled chicken, lobster, et al. Easy to make and oh-so impressive a dish. Garnish with a lemon wheel and a sprig of cilantro.\"",
    "ins": "Shred fontina cheese in a food processor.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.\nStir butter into the pasta until thoroughly coated. Add fontina cheese 1 handful at a time, allowing it to melt between handfuls. Stir in heavy cream gradually until desired creaminess is achieved. Season with salt, pepper, sage, and cayenne pepper. Top pasta with lobster.",
