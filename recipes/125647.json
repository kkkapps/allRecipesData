    "ins": "In a small bowl, soften gelatin in cold water; set aside. Place cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla bean in a saucepan. Stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a simmer. Simmer gently for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and discard the vanilla bean.\nAdd gelatin and water to the hot cream mixture. Stir until gelatin dissolves. Pour into 6 lightly oiled 1/2-cup dariole molds (or other small cylindrical molds) and refrigerate overnight or at least 8 hours.\nTo make the berry sauce, combine berries and sugar in a bowl. Crush berries slightly with the back of a spoon, and mix in the brandy. Let stand for an hour until it has a syrupy consistency.\nUnmold panna cottas and serve with berry sauce.",
