    "ins": "Combine the butter, brown sugar, water, molasses, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and black pepper in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from the heat, and allow to cool. Once warm to the touch, stir in the vanilla extract, and pour into a mixing bowl. Cover, and let stand at room temperature at least 8 hours.\nStir in the raisins, dates, pecans, and candied fruit. Whisk together the salt, baking soda, and flour; stir into the fruit mixture until no dry lumps remain. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours until firm.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nForm the mixture into golf ball-sized balls. Place onto ungreased baking sheets 1 1/2-inches apart, and flatten with your palm to 1/4-inch thick. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
