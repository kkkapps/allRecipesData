    "des": "\"Tasty marinated chicken gets a kick from smokey ancho chili peppers. Serve with a mandarin and spring green salad and a good Riesling. Alternately, you can skewer chicken on bamboo skewers which have been soaked for about 20 minutes and cook them over a small flame.\"",
    "ins": "Combine ancho chile, soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon grass, ground turmeric, and ground allspice together in a large resealable bag; add chicken and shake until coated. Refrigerate and marinate chicken for at least 1 hour.\nTransfer chicken to a skillet and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
