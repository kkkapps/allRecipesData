    "des": "\"This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.  You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go!!  It yields a soft, chewy crust.  For a real treat, I recommend you use bread flour and bake it on a pizza stone, but all-purpose flour works well too. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.\nStir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
