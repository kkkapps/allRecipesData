    "ins": "Place salmon in a large bowl with ice cold water and 1 pinch salt. Let soak, about 10 minutes. Run a knife along the skin to remove all scales.\nRinse salmon in ice cold water and lemon juice. Pat dry with a paper towel.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCombine garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle lightly over both sides of each salmon fillet. Rub jerk marinade over both sides of salmon.\nPlace salmon fillets in a large bowl. Add scallions, onion, cilantro, and ginger; mix well to combine.\nHeat oil in an ovensafe skillet over medium heat. Cook salmon fillets skin-side down, in batches if necessary, until skin is golden, about 2 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until flesh is pale pink, 1 to 2 minutes more. Place skillet in the oven.\nBake salmon in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from oven and allow salmon to rest before serving, 3 to 5 minutes.",
