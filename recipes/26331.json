Beat in egg yolks, then milk.\nIn a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the lemon mixture. Pour filling into pie crust. Scatter blueberries evenly over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven for approximately 50 minutes, or until filling is set. Cover the pie with foil after about 30 minutes to avoid browning.
