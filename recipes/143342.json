    "des": "\"My husband and I are trying to add more variety to our diets, and cut back on red meat, so I came up with this ground chicken burger, and it is delish! I used my George Foreman grill to cook them. I served them with the spicy baked sweet potato fries found on this Website. They make a nice substitution for a regular cheeseburger and French fries.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grill grate, and place about 4 inches from heat source.\nMix the ground chicken, onion, garlic, taco seasoning, and egg together in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide chicken mixture evenly and form into 4 soft patties.\nCook the chicken patties on the preheated grill until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on thickness. To serve, place each patty on one half of a hamburger bun, top with a slice of cheese, avocado slices, and desired amounts of jalapeno peppers and salsa. Cover with remaining half of bun.",
