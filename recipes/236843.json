    "des": "\"My mother gave me this recipe for potato soup and it is extremely easy and tastes great. Substitute butter for the oil if desired. Regular bacon can be substituted for turkey bacon if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and turkey bacon until browned, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMix water and chicken bouillon together in a bowl, stirring and breaking cubes apart with a fork, until dissolved. Stir evaporated milk and garlic salt into bouillon mixture.\nDrain potatoes, setting about 1/8 aside in a bowl. Mix the potatoes, evaporated milk mixture, onion-bacon mixture, and butter together in a pot until soup is creamy and smooth. Add the reserved potatoes to soup, breaking potatoes apart for desired texture. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until soup is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.",
