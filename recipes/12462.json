    "des": "\"This pie is simple to prepare. Serve with a salad for dinner, or with fruit for brunch. Dry goat cheese can be used in place of feta cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the yellow and red onions, and saute over moderate heat for 5 minutes.  Stir in the wine, then add the leeks.  Saute for another 15 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the onions are golden and the leeks are limp.  Remove from heat.\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the beaten eggs with dill, tarragon, feta cheese, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.   Stir in the onion mixture.\nOil a 10 inch tart pan, and line the bottom generously with bread crumbs.  Pour in the onion mixture.  Ring the outside edge of the pie with tomato slices, and sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley in the center.  Sprinkle a light layer of bread crumbs over the entire top.\nBake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the mixture is set and the top is golden.  Let stand for 10 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.",
