    "des": "\"The authentic version uses tripe.  I have never cared for tripe, myself, and I have always substituted chicken, beef, turkey, sausage or even ham instead.\"",
    "ins": "Place the tripe or other meat that you have selected to use in a saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and  turn off the heat.  Allow the meat  to cool a bit in the water, and then drain and rinse. Cut into 1/4 inch pieces.\nIn a large heavy kettle, saute the bacon until clear.  Add the onion, celery, leeks, parsley, and green peppers; saute until tender.\nStir in beef stock, thyme, marjoram, cloves, red pepper flakes, bay leaf, and black pepper.  Bring the  kettle to a boil, and turn down to a simmer.  Cook, covered, until meat  is very tender, about 2 hours.\nAdd the diced potato and carrots, and cook for an additional 20 minutes.\nPrepare the roux by stirring the flour into the melted butter or margarine, and cooking for a moment on the stove.  When the soup is done to your liking, stir in the roux.   Simmer, stirring all the while, until the soup  thickens a bit. Correct the seasonings.",
