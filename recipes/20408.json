    "des": "\"Warm tater salad is easy; just mix everything together when the taters are still warm. The mustard and turmeric are to taste, so just start with a little and keep adding until  you get the flavor you're looking for.  Also, the onions are optional in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.\nPlace eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, turmeric and onion.  Add the still-warm potatoes and stir until evenly coated.  Gently mix in the hard-cooked eggs.  Serve immediately, or refrigerate and serve cold.",
