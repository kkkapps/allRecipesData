    "des": "\"This is an incredible bread. Its moistness comes from the addition of an unusual ingredient: coconut milk! If sweetened coconut is used, reduce white sugar to 1/2 cup.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans.\nSpread walnuts in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Toast in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Set aside to cool.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, white sugar, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Add the pumpkin puree, oil, and coconut milk, and mix until all of the flour is absorbed. Fold in the flaked coconut and toasted walnuts. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.\nBake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from oven, and cover loaves tightly with foil. Allow to steam for 10 minutes. Remove foil, and turn out onto a cooling rack. Tent loosely with the foil, and allow to cool completely.",
