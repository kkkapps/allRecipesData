    "des": "\"Start this spicy whole wheat yeast bread with lots of warm spices, dried cranberries and chopped pecans in your bread machine. When done, shape it and bake it! This recipe is fun to play with! Change the spices, nuts and dried fruit according to your preference. Tastes great as a sandwich bread, toasted, warm with butter or French toast!\"",

Check dough halfway through kneading cycle to ensure it has a tacky consistency.\nGrease a loaf pan. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a loaf; place in the loaf pan. Cover loosely with a towel or waxed paper and let rise in warm place until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool.",
