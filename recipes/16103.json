Lightly spray cubes with oil or cooking spray and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven and cool.\nPrepare the dressing by whisking together the sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, mustard, honey, rosemary, salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\nPrepare the salad by placing the chicken in a pan and cover with water. Bring just to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.  Remove from heat, drain and cool; dice or pull into shreds.\nCombine the chicken with the celery, raisins and lemon peel.\nWhen ready to serve, stir together the lemon juice and olive oil. Tear the lettuce into small pieces and toss with the lemon and oil mixture.  Divide between plates and top with the chicken salad. Garnish with onion rings, a sprinkling of pine nuts and the croutons.",
