    "des": "\"Great side dish. French lentils (also called puy lentils) have a wonderful earthy flavor. You can't substitute regular green/brown lentils. They are expensive but usually affordable at your local food co-op. Goat cheese has a creamier texture than feta. I like to add grape tomatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Combine sherry vinegar, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and minced garlic in a jar with a lid and shake until blended. Set aside.\nPlace lentils, chicken broth, water, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the lentils are just tender to the bite, about 20 minutes. Do not overcook. Remove from heat, drain, and cool for at least 30 minutes. Transfer cooled lentils to a mixing bowl.\nStir in the dressing,  chives, and cilantro; mix well. If you're serving the salad immediately, add the goat cheese and tomatoes. If you're preparing the recipe ahead of time, refrigerate the salad and add the goat cheese and tomatoes just before serving.",
