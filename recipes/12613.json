    "ins": "Line 8 inch pie plate with heavy foil or freezer wrap letting it extend 5 inches beyond rim. Add the 1 quart filling.\nLoosely cover filling with the lining foil or paper. Freeze until firm. When firm, remove from pie plate and wrap tightly. Return frozen pie filling to freezer.\nTo prepare pie for baking:  For each pie prepare a two crust pastry. Line 9 inch pie plate with pastry. Remove freezer wrap from frozen shaped pie filling. Place in pastry lined 9 inch pan. Dot with 1 tablespoon butter and, if desired, sprinkle with cinnamon. Adjust top crust and finish pie as usual. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour or until syrup boils with heavy bubbles that do not burst.\nNote: With such fruits as peaches, pears or cherries, stir about 1/2 teaspoon ascorbic acid into sugar before combining with fruit.",
