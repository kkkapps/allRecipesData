Press firmly into bottom and up sides of an 8 inch pie plate; refrigerate until firm.\nIn a small bowl, whip the heavy cream with 2 packets sweetener until soft peaks form. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl with high sides, mix the gelatin with boiling water until all the gelatin has dissolved. Then stir in the cold water. With an electric mixer, slowly beat in the cream cheese. After all cream cheese is added, stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract, and beat at high speed until smooth. Carefully fold in the whipped cream. Use a spatula to scrape mixture into the pie pan and spread around. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons  ground nuts on top. Refrigerate several hours or overnight to allow gelatin to set thoroughly.",
