    "des": "\"This is an excellent mixed fruit with a little kick, which is frozen in individual cups.  I served it as a frozen fruit salad but have had it served to me as a refreshing afternoon snack.  It would also make an excellent light dessert.  I received this recipe from Janet Carswell.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir the orange juice concentrate and sugar together until the sugar has dissolved; gently stir in the pineapple, strawberries, and bananas until coated, then stir in the ginger ale. Ladle about 2/3 cup of the mixture into a plastic cup, and freeze; repeat with remaining fruit salad and cups. Remove from freezer about 1 hour before serving.",
