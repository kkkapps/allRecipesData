Cook for 10 minutes in the microwave, or until starting to become tender.\nPreheat the oven's broiler. Place the sweet potato slices onto a greased broiler pan. Slice the feta cheese the best you can, and place a piece on top of each potato slice. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over all.\nPlace under the preheated broiler for about 6 minutes, or until cheese is lightly browned.",
