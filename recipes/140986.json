    "des": "\"A wonderful exotic dish fit for kings.  It includes olives, capers, tomatoes and anchovies, this is a dish you should definitely try.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes in a medium pot and fill with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until fork-tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, cover, and set aside.\nWhile the potatoes are cooking, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet on medium high.  Rinse the trout fillets and pat dry. Season the trout with the dried Italian seasoning and salt and pepper. Gently place the trout in the heated oil and pan fry without moving the fillets for 10 minutes.\nCarefully turn the fillets. Arrange the bell pepper and onions on top of the trout and cook for 5 minutes. Then, place the anchovies, olives, tomatoes, capers, and parsley on top of the fillets. Pour in the white wine and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Serve the trout and vegetables on a bed of steamed potatoes.",
