    "des": "\"This is a recipe I found in one of my grandma's recipe books, and she had them titled Wundervulle Schokoladenkuchen, and they really are wonderful! It was dated 1948, and originally called for cups of chocolate chunks, but was crossed out at some point and Nestle\u00c2\u00ae chocolate chips was written in. These are for the real chocolate lover. A little time intensive, but really worth the wait! Enjoy!\"",
