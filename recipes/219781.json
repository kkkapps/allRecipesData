    "des": "\"This soup is delicious and rich. We like it best on cold days. You can use more or less broth depending on how thick you like your French Onion Soup. Also try making with a Chardonnay as a delicious variation.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter with the olive oil in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion slices and garlic to the pot; season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook the onions in the oil mixture until caramelized, stirring every 10 minutes to keep from browning too quickly, about 1 hour.\nStir the brown sugar and thyme into the caramelized onions; allow the sugar to melt into the onion mixture, about 2 minutes. Pour the wine over the onions and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon; continue simmering another 5 minutes. Add the beef stock; cook together another 10 minutes. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if desired.\nPreheat the oven's broiler.\nLadle the soup into 5 oven-safe crocks arranged onto a baking sheet. Top the soup with a slice of French bread; cover with a slice of Swiss cheese and sprinkle with some of the Parmagiano-Reggiano cheese.\nMelt the cheese under the broiler until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.",
