The owners are very good friends of mine, and the culinary creations at this fishing lodge are out of this world!  I promise, one of these cookies will fill you as much as a cheeseburger and fries would!\"",

Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture until well incorporated. Mix in oats, then stir in the chocolate chips, nuts, coconut and raisins. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Let cookies cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
