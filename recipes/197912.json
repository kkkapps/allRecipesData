    "des": "\"This perfectly seasoned dry rub is perfect for smoking pork butts, ribs, and beef briskets. It gets a little kick from just the right amount of cayenne pepper, plus the unique flavor of sassafras. The brown sugar creates a nice crunchy 'bark' on the outside of the meat.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the salt, paprika, brown sugar, file powder, thyme, dill, oregano, basil, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, mustard, allspice, and sage in a bowl until evenly blended. Store the rub at room temperature in an airtight container.\nTo use: liberally coat pork butt or brisket with some of the rub, massaging it into the meat. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Smoke meat as you normally would.",
