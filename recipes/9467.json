    "des": "\"This candy is good any time of the year but it's especially festive at Christmas! Vanilla, lemon or walnut extract can be easily substituted for almond to add a little variety to your candies.\"",
    "ins": "Lightly grease one 12x18 inch or larger baking sheet.\nIn a large heavy saucepan, combine the water, sugar and corn syrup. Heat over high, stirring constantly with a heat resistant spoon, until all sugar is dissolved. Stop stirring and bring to a boil.  Boil until a candy thermometer reads 310 degrees F (154 degrees C). Remove from heat.\nWhen bubbling has ceased, stir in the flavoring and a food coloring. Spread into the prepared pan so that the candy is no more than 1/4 inch thick. Cool for 45 minutes in the refrigerator. Remove from refrigerator, crack into pieces and enjoy!",
