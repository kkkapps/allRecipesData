    "des": "\"I love pizza, but I can no longer eat yeast bread. I can have wheat though, so pasta is still in. To serve my pizza craving, I devised this dish that delivers all the goodness of a supreme combo pizza without the yeast bread.  For a crowd, serve with garlic bread and salad and/or veggies on the side to really stretch this dish.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nHeat spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat.\nCook and stir sausage and water in a large skillet over medium heat, using a potato masher to break sausage into small pieces, until sausage is crumbly and almost cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add pepper and onion; cook and stir until onion is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.\nStir cottage cheese, eggs, Parmesan cheese, and parsley together in a bowl.\nSpread about 1 cup warmed spaghetti sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread 1/2 of the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles, another 1 cup spaghetti sauce over the cheese, and 2/3 cup sausage mixture over the top. Sprinkle 1/2 of the pepperoni pieces, 1/2 of the sliced mushrooms, and 1/2 of the olives over the sausage mixture. Scatter 1/3 the mozzarella cheese over the top and arrange 3 lasagna noodles atop the cheese. Repeat layering again.\nPour remaining spaghetti sauce over the lasagna and sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over the top. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling around the edges, about 25 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until cheese is melted and golden, about 5 minutes more. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing.",
