Place salmon in the bag, seal, and marinate 8 hours or overnight in the refrigerator.\nPreheat a grill for high heat.\nLightly oil the grill grate. Reserving marinade, place salmon on the grill, and cook 5 to 8 minutes on each side, or until easily flaked with a fork.\nTransfer reserved marinade to a pot. Dissolve the cornstarch in cold water. Bring the marinade to a boil, and stir in cornstarch mixture to thicken. Serve over the salmon or on the side as a dipping sauce.",
