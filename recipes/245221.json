    "ins": "Bring water and wild rice to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Drain excess liquid. Cool rice to room temperature.\nToss zucchini with 1 teaspoon salt in a sieve; drain until liquid has been released, about 10 minutes. Squeeze out excess liquid and transfer zucchini to a bowl. Mix wild rice, bread crumbs, onion, and hazelnuts into zucchini.\nWhisk eggs, milk, and baking soda together in a separate bowl until blended. Mix egg mixture into zucchini mixture  until batter is wet but not runny.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Scoop batter, about 2 tablespoons per fritter, into hot oil. Flatten fritter with spatula and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer fritters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; season with salt and pepper.",
