    "des": "\"Tapioca root (also called cassava or yucca root) makes a delightful steamed cake in this recipe. The cake is steamed in ramekins. Serve hot or cold. They can also be served in the ramekins or not.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the sugar, coconut cream, and cornstarch together in a bowl until the sugar dissolves completely. Add the grated cassava, water, and about 1/3 of the grated coconut; mix well.\nToss the remaining coconut with the salt in a separate bowl; set aside.\nBring a couple inches of water to boil in a wok or large pot. Arrange 8 1-cup ramekins into a large steamer insert and place over the boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove the insert and spoon the cassava mixture into the heated ramekins to fill. Sprinkle a portion of the coconut over the top of each cake.\nSteam the cakes over the boiling water until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Depending on the size of your steamer, you may need to do this in multiple batches. Make sure you have enough water to continually boil, if this is the case.",
