Top each breast with some of the mushrooms.\nWhisk celery soup and milk together in a bowl; pour over the bacon-wrapped chicken breasts. Cover dish with aluminum foil.\nBake chicken in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until the bacon is browned and breasts are no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
