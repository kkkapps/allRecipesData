    "des": "\"This recipe makes a soft, chewy cookie that your family will gobble up in a hurry!  There are only four ingredients and I have most of them in my pantry or refrigerator at all times -- no hunting for exotic ingredients!  If chocolate is not your favorite, the recipe can be changed by using a lemon cake mix with the pudding in the mix.  They are great also!\"",
