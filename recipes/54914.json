    "ins": "Dissolve yeast packages in 1 cup of warm water; set aside.\nBring milk to a boil. Remove from heat; add remaining 1 cup water, butter, and 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon of salt; stir until butter melts. Pour in sugar and stir until dissolved.\nWhen milk mixture has cooled to lukewarm, stir in dissolved yeast.\nIn a separate bowl, beat eggs until combined. Whisk milk mixture into eggs. Gradually add 5 pounds of flour. Transfer dough to a floured work surface, and use a serrated knife to divide dough in half. Shape each half into a ball and place the dough in two large oiled bowls. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nOnce risen, turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and divide into 6 equal portions. Shape the dough into balls. (Dough will be very sticky and soft at this point.) Keep the dough covered with greased plastic wrap while you divide one dough ball into 3 pieces. Shape the dough into three ropes, braid together, and place on a lightly greased baking sheet or parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining loaves. You should be able to fit two loaves per baking sheet.\nBake loaves in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until hollow-sounding when tapped on top. Let cool, and enjoy!",
