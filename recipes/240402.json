    "des": "\"This roast recipe is easy to prepare, smoked with the unique taste of maple wood chips. This can be done on any smoker or grill that can maintain the temperature between 200 degrees F and 250 degrees F. I use an electric chest-type smoker with digital controls and a meat temperature probe.\"",
    "ins": "Soak wood chips in water until fully moistened, at least 1 hour.\nPreheat smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Place a drip pan beneath the rack where you will roast the meat.\nSeason roast generously with sea salt and black pepper to coat on all sides; rub seasoning into the meat and fat.\nPut the roast into the preheated smoker above the drip pan with the fat cap facing upwards.\nAdd 2/3 cup of the soaked wood chips to your heat source according to your smoker's instruction manual.\nSmoke the roast in the preheated smoker for 30 minutes. Add half the remaining wood chips to the heat source. Smoke another 30 minutes and add remainder of the wood chips. Continue smoking roast until browned on the outside and red in the center, about 2 hours more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (49 degrees C).\nRemove roast to a cutting board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and rest beef for 30 minutes. Carve into 1/2- to 1-inch slices.",
