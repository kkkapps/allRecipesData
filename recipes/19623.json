    "ins": "Place the chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper and pound until thin. Remove breasts and place into a large resealable plastic bag.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, and Italian-style seasoning. Pour mixture into the plastic bag containing the chicken.\nSeal the plastic bag and shake gently to ensure that all the chicken is in contact with the marinade. Refrigerate marinated chicken pieces overnight or up to two days.\nWhen ready to cook, preheat grill and lightly oil grate. Place chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes per side.",
