    "des": "\"This recipe was formed from an idea I had one night for pork chops stuffed with apples. This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party and I know I'll be making these again very shortly.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking pan.\nMix together the apple pie filling and cinnamon in a bowl.\nLay each chop on cutting board and, with a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut a pocket into the chop going all the way to the bone and leaving the sides intact. Fill each pocket with one quarter of the filling mixture (about 1/2 cup). Coat the pork chops with maple syrup, then dredge them in the cornflake crumbs until completely covered. Place chops in baking pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
