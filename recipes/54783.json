    "des": "\"This is a recipe I created when I realized that our bottled salad dressing was frozen and couldn't thaw quickly enough. It is very easy to make from ingredients usually already on hand. You can vary the amounts, or even substitute low-fat ingredients according to your personal taste. Tastes even better when chilled over night!\"",
    "ins": "Mix together lemon juice, parmesan cheese, garlic salt, and mayonnaise until smooth. Stir in milk, adjusting the amount or adding a little water, to make the dressing as thin or thick as you like. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.",
