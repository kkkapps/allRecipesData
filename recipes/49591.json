Lightly coat the round steak pieces in the flour mixture.\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the celery, onion, and carrots about 5 minutes, until tender.

Mix in the tomatoes with juice, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar.\nCover, and cook 8 to 10 hours on Low, until the round steak is very tender.",
