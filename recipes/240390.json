    "ins": "Stir 1 tablespoon liquid amino acid and onion powder together in a small bowl to dissolve the powder into liquid; pour into a large plastic resealable bag; add zucchini and kale and work the bag to coat vegetables with the marinade. Squeeze bag to remove excess air and seal. Marinate vegetables for 10 to 15 minutes.\nBlend coconut milk, macadamia nuts, cashews, nutritional yeast, chili powder, remaining liquid amino acid, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes in a blender until smooth.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour zucchini and kale from the plastic bag into the skillet; saute just until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.\nDivide cooked rice between two bowls; top each portion with about half the vegetable mixture. Drizzle the blended sauce over the vegetables.",
