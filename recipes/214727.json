    "des": "\"I read a recipe a while back about a chocolate cake that was cooked in 3 minutes in the microwave.  I didn't really believe it, but I tried it out and then proceeded to alter it to suit my own tastes because I thought it was too heavy and the texture was a bit wonky - if decent for an instant chocolate fix at 12:00 in the morning.  Still, the unpleasant texture just became more pronounced as I experimented with vanilla variations.  At last, here is my 5-minute lemon-poppy seed cake that rises beautifully and is light and airy - unlike the chocolate cake.\"",

Pour batter into a large microwave-safe glass or ceramic mug or cereal bowl.\nHeat in the microwave on high until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 3 minutes.",
