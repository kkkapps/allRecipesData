    "des": "\"A traditional Chinese fish recipe. Chinese love fresh seafood! Steamed fish is an easy way to prep fish and at the same time keep the original flavor of the fish. In this recipe, a whole sea bass, ginger, and spring onions are steamed to perfection and then topped with soy sauce, sugar, and hot oil. Serve with freshly cooked rice.\"",
    "ins": "Season sea bass with salt.\nPlace 1/3 of the spring onions and ginger onto a glass or ceramic plate; cover with sea bass. Scatter remaining spring onions and ginger over the sea bass.\nBring a wide pot of water to a boil. Set a rack inside the boiling water; place the plate of sea bass on top. Cover pot and steam until sea bass flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour out any water that may have collected on the plate.\nMix soy sauce, chile oil, and sugar together in a small bowl; pour over the sea bass before serving.",
