    "ins": "Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir flour, sea salt, celery salt, and black pepper into the butter. Gradually stir half-and-half into the mixture, taking care that no lumps form. Add lobster stock; stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring constantly, until the soup begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.\nStir lobster, tomato paste, onion, and celery into the soup; season with paprika, thyme, and seafood seasoning. Continue cooking the soup to heat the onion and celery, about 10 minutes. Add cream; stir. Cook until hot, about 5 minutes.",
