    "des": "\"Ostrich and venison are the two meats with the lowest fat contents. Try this for a simple change. Gentle cooking is \nbest (cooking too fast will turn the steaks leathery), and we aim for rare or medium. I like mine rare, and turn when \nthe outside begins (just) to caramelise. A definite hit with my guests every time I do it. If you can get Creme Fraiche \nthen fine, but try to avoid any CF that is labeled 'light'. This curdles when heated. You can thicken the sauce if you \nlike by using less stock. Serve with rice or potatoes and some tasty vegetables.\n\"",
    "ins": "Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the ostrich steaks in the hot butter until the outside is just  about to be crisp, shown by darkening patches as with a beef steak, about 2 minutes per side. An instant-read  thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for rare. Remove the ostrich steaks from the pan, and keep warm.\nPour the beef stock into the skillet, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for a few minutes until slightly reduced, then lower the heat to medium-low, and stir in the creme fraiche. Cook and stir 2 minutes, then pour in the Calvados, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Season each ostrich steak with pepper to taste. Spoon the sauce over the steaks to serve.",
