    "ins": "Place garbanzo beans, parsley, onion, flour, garlic, cumin, baking powder, coriander, salt, lemon juice, and black pepper in a food processor or blender. Pulse until combined and a chunky, slightly sticky mixture forms.\nRoll mixture into small balls and place on a plate. Flatten into patties that are 2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick.\nPlace patties in refrigerator or freezer to help hold together, about 10 minutes.\nHeat 1 1/2- to 2-inches vegetable oil in large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFry patties, working in batches to avoid crowding, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain patties on paper towel-lined plate.",
