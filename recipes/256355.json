    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange wings in a baking pan.\nMix barbeque sauce and syrup together in a bowl; pour evenly over wings.\nBake in the preheated oven, flipping every 15 to 20 minutes, for 1 hour. Turn on oven's broiler and broil wings until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
