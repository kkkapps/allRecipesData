    "des": "\"Eloise used to make these cookies for us when I was a little girl. These are the best! To lighten them up, applesauce can be substituted for part or all of the shortening. The flavor is still great, but the texture will change.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat 1 cup white sugar and shortening together in a large bowl until light and creamy. Add molasses and egg; beat until smooth.\nWhisk flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into shortening mixture until dough is just-combined.\nPour 1/2 cup white sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll dough into 1-inch balls and roll each ball in sugar to coat; place 2-inches apart on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until set and lightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes.",
