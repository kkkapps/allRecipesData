    "ins": "Place the water, sugar, and butter in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until the sugar and butter dissolve, about 10 minutes. Pour into a mixing bowl and cool to room temperature.\nStir the crushed animal crackers into the sugar mixture until evenly moistened; spread half the mixture into an 8x8-inch baking dish. Stir the cocoa powder into the remaining animal cracker mixture until smooth; spread into the baking dish over the lighter-colored layer. Spread the melted chocolate evenly over the bajadera.\nRefrigerate overnight; cut into 16 pieces to serve.",
