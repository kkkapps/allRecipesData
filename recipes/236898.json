    "des": "\"This is great as a snack or for breakfast and also on top of yogurt. You won't be disappointed. Easy to vary the ingredients and substitute other nuts or flaked coconut, etc.  Also makes a great gift at the holidays. Just put in a small mason jar, attach a copy of the recipe, and wrap it up with a fun cereal bowl. My kids' teachers loved to leave the jar on their desk to snack on.\"",
