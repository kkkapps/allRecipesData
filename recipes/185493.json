    "des": "\"This is actually a LARGE sandwich using a loaf of crispy Italian bread. Great served as a meal, cut into slices as an appetizer or separate onto individual rolls for a quick dinner or lunch.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nCombine the mayonnaise, sour cream, and hot sauce in a small bowl.  Spread both halves of the bread with the mayonnaise mixture.  Place chicken on bottom half of bread; layer bacon and cheese on top of chicken.   Fold the top half of the bread over the bottom, and wrap with foil.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes. Add a layer of red pepper slices on top of the bacon and cheese, if desired. Cut into slices, and serve.",
