    "des": "\"Take the hassle out of making Spiced Couscous and Shrimp at home with the pure flavor of McCormick\u00c2\u00ae herbs and spices. A blend of turmeric, cinnamon and cumin lends warmth to a traditional homemade Chermoula--a Moroccan herb sauce typically served with seafood. Layer sauce, couscous and shrimp in a bowl for a Moroccan-inspired meal worth gathering around the table for.\"",
    "ins": "For the Spice Blend, mix all ingredients in small bowl. Set aside.\nFor the Chermoula, place cilantro, garlic and lemon juice in blender container; cover. Blend until almost smooth.  Gradually add oil with machine running. Blend until smooth. Mix in 1 1/4 teaspoons of the Spice Blend.  Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.\nFor the Couscous, bring water to boil in small saucepan. Stir in remaining ingredients and another 1 1/4 teaspoons of the Spice Blend. Cover. Remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with fork.\nFor the Shrimp, toss shrimp with remaining Spice Blend in medium bowl until evenly coated. Heat oil in medium skillet on high heat. Add shrimp; cook 1 minute per side or just until shrimp turn pink.\nTo serve, spoon Chermoula into serving bowl. Top with couscous and shrimp. Garnish with cilantro, if desired.",
