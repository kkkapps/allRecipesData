    "des": "\"This delicious salad may be served warm or at room temperature. It takes patience to cook the vegetables properly, but it makes a wonderful side to any fall feast! Enjoy the process of creating something your family will enjoy. Substituting regular broccoli may be okay, but baby broccoli is sweeter and more suited to this dish.\"",

Stir in red onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.

Remove from skillet and add to beans.\nHeat 1 more tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add butternut squash; cook and stir until tender, about 8 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon maple syrup; cook and stir to coat, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and add squash to bean mixture.\nHeat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
