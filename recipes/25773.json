Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm and lightly toasted at the edges. Melt chocolate chips in the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, stirring frequently until smooth. Spread over bars. Cool completely before cutting into squares.",
