    "des": "\"A supremely filling, hearty soup.  I serve this on cold rainy days with a loaf of homemade bread.  Hint: this is perfect for leftover rotisserie chicken or chicken you've pulled from the bone after making homemade chicken stock!  This soup makes great leftovers, but you might want to thin it slightly with skim milk or water when reheating.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over medium heat, combine broth, water and chicken. Bring just to boiling, then stir in rice, reserving seasoning packet. Cover and remove from heat.\nIn a small bowl, combine salt, pepper and flour. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Stir in contents of seasoning packet until mixture is bubbly. Reduce heat to low, then stir in flour mixture by tablespoons, to form a roux. Whisk in cream, a little at a time, until fully incorporated and smooth. Cook until thickened, 5 minutes.\nStir cream mixture into broth and rice. Cook over medium heat until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.",
