    "ins": "Set up the cauldron in serving area and stir the grape sherbet and grape soda together in the cauldron until smooth. With tongs, carefully place the dry ice into the cauldron. It will sink to the bottom and cause the punch to bubble and smoke. Careful, dry ice is so cold it can burn if touched or ingested. Do not consume dry ice.",
