    "des": "\"This gluten-free filling can be used in a regular pie crust or a gluten-free pie crust. You can even bake it without a crust at all, like a dish of custard. A different use for the abundance of zucchini. This usually makes one pie plus about 1 cup left over, which I pour into a small baking dish and bake it like a custard.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the zucchini and cook uncovered until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Process cooled zucchini in a blender until smooth; measure out 2 cups zucchini puree.\nStir the 2 cups zucchini puree, evaporated milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl.",
