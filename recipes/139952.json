    "des": "\"This is a variation of a boiled or seven-minute style frosting that I love. Strawberry gelatin gives it a boost of flavor and makes it marshmallowy good. You could use other flavors and colors of gelatin to suit your theme. It sets up fairly quick so you'll want to use it right after you make it.\"",
    "ins": "In a small saucepan, stir together the sugar, water and corn syrup. Bring to a boil and cook to 240 degrees F (116 degrees C) or until a the mixture makes a wispy thread when dripped from a spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in the gelatin. Set aside for just a second while you start the egg whites. If it starts to look weird, give it a quick stir. The gelatin mixture may look grainy, but it will smooth out once it gets mixed in.\nWhip egg whites in a clean dry bowl to soft peaks. If you have a stand mixer, use it, otherwise you may need a helper to whip while you pour. Slowly pour, or spoon the sugar mixture into the egg whites while continuing to whip to stiff glossy peaks. Use to frost a cake or cupcakes. This frosting does not need to be refrigerated.",
