    "des": "\"I used to make these all the time in California and they are so easy and fresh! You can also omit the mayonnaise and increase the red vinegar to reduce calories. All in all, these are a great main dish for any time of year! We usually serve them with fat-free refried beans topped with cilantro and goat cheese, or a cold corn salad with chopped bell pepper and onion.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace cod fillets on a large sheet of aluminum foil; pour lemon juice over fish and  season with salt and black pepper to taste. Fold the foil around the fish and seal to create a pouch; place pouch in a baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk vinegar, mayonnaise, sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, and garlic powder in a bowl until smooth. Combine cabbage, mango, pineapple, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeno in large bowl. Pour dressing over vegetables and fruit; toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate slaw until ready to serve.\nDivide fish evenly among flour tortillas. Spoon slaw over fish to serve.",
