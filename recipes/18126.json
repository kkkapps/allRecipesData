Reduce heat to low and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTransfer the onion and celery mixture to the pot and stir in the chicken soup base. Heat slowly, then add the cheese. Allow the cheese to melt, stirring all together well.\nIn a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the 1/2 cup milk and pour into the soup. Mix well until thickened.",
