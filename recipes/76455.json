    "des": "\"This recipe is adapted from a famous Filipino restaurant in Manila, Philippines. The longer you marinate in the refrigerator, the better it gets! This is one dish that doesn't spoil right away. Best served hot over steamed rice.\"",
    "ins": "Season pork and chicken with salt and pepper and place in a stock pot. Rub with crushed garlic and torn bay leaf, and coat with vinegar (and soy sauce, if using). Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours, or overnight.\nBring meat and marinating liquid to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is fork-tender. If necessary, add a small amount of water to prevent drying out.\nStrain liquid from meat. Return to the stock pot and bring to a simmer. In a skillet, cook and stir meat in 1 tablespoon of oil over medium high heat until brown on all sides, adding remaining 2 cloves of smashed garlic in the last 3 minutes. Add meats to cooking liquid, and continue simmering until slightly thickened. Serve hot.",
