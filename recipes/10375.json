    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCream together white sugar, brown sugar and shortening until fluffy. Stir in the vanilla and eggs. Combine the flour, wheat germ, salt and baking soda; mix into the batter. Stir in crispy rice cereal and chocolate chips. Drop by teaspoonfuls on an ungreased cookie sheet, spacing cookies 2 inches apart.\nBake for 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are light brown at the edges. Cool well before eating as the chocolate can burn your mouth.",
