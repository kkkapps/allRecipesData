    "des": "\"Use any cut of steak when making this easy beef stew. Marinated in oil, oregano, vinegar, and onions, this is a great meal for a busy weeknight. A staple in Puerto Rican cooking. Serve with white rice and tostones. Water can be used in place of beef stock if desired.\"",
    "ins": "In a large resealable bag, combine the steak, olive oil, garlic, oregano, sazon seasoning, onions, vinegar, beef stock, and salt. Seal and shake to mix. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or up to a couple of days.\nWhen you are ready to cook, dump the entire contents of the bag into a large deep skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until the beef is fork tender, about 40 minutes.",
