    "ins": "Preheat grill for high heat.\nIn a large bowl, mix together ground beef, onion, raisins, and parsley. Season with cayenne pepper, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, sugar, salt, and pepper, and mix well. Form into 6 flat sausages around skewers. Lightly brush sausages with oil; this prevents sticking to the grill.\nArrange skewers on hot grill grate. Cook for approximately 15 minutes, turning occasionally to brown evenly, until well done.",
