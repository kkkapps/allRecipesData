    "des": "\"Brown butter frosting is an 'old' recipe that is not commonly used anymore; however it is delicious. It is easy to make as long as you are careful to not burn the butter. This frosting is great on top of brownies.\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter, stirring constantly, in a saucepan over medium-low heat until it browns and becomes very aromatic, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk confectioners' sugar into butter until dissolved and remove saucepan from heat; stir in milk and vanilla extract.\nBeat butter mixture using an electric mixer until frosting is smooth; add more milk if frosting is too thick.",
