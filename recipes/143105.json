    "des": "\"I created this recipe through a series of trial and error. As they say, practice makes perfect. You can make the marinade and cook the loin immediately or you can let the pork soak overnight. Either way, I promise this will be the best pork tenderloin you've ever had. It may seem like a lot of ingredients, but it is a very simple recipe and well worth the effort.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the pork tenderloin in a deep baking dish.  Mix together the garlic, onion, parsley, mustard, wine, yogurt, olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, thyme, bouillon, and lemon juice in a bowl; pour over the pork. Cover the entire dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour 30 minutes.\nRemove the tenderloin from the dish and cover with aluminum foil on a cutting board. Allow to rest for 20 minutes before slicing. Reserve the sauce from the dish and serve on the side.",
