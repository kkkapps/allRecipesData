    "des": "\"Being from New Orleans, and being a true 'Cajun cook' I create a lot of my own recipes simply by experimenting.  This dip recipe came to me when I decided that adding crab boil to almost anything will make it taste incredible.  Everyone that tastes it agrees! It's best when prepared a day ahead of time and reheated. Serve with chicken flavored crackers.\"",
    "ins": "Place the crawfish tails into a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped. Set aside.\nMelt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the crawfish tails, garlic, crab boil, salt and Old Bay seasoning. Cook and stir until garlic is toasted. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream cheese until it has melted. Serve the dip warm or refrigerate and serve chilled.",
