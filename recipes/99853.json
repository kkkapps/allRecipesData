    "ins": "Allow dough to rise in a covered bowl until doubled in bulk.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nRoll the dough on a floured surface into a 15-inch circle.  Roll the edges towards the center to form a crust, leaving a 12-inch circle.  Brush the entire crust generously with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, 1 sprig of chopped basil, and rosemary.  Bake in preheated oven until the crust begins to turn golden, 8 to 10 minutes.\nSpread the crust with tomato sauce.  Sprinkle with 2 sprigs of chopped basil and goat cheese.  Bake in preheated oven until the crust is brown, and the pizza has heated through, about 8 more minutes.",
