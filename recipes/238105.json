    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nScore the top of the ham in a diamond pattern with serrated knife. Place ham on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Pour 1 1/2 cups mango nectar over ham.\nBake in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the ham is 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nStir brown sugar, Dijon mustard, ginger root, cinnamon, and cloves together in a small bowl.\nCombine mango preserves, white wine, and remaining 1/2 cup mango nectar together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stir in brown sugar mixture, reduce heat to low, and simmer until glaze thickens, 2 to 4 minutes.\nBrush ham all over with glaze. Continue baking until glaze is bubbling, about 10 minutes more. Remove ham from oven and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving.",
