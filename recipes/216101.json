    "ins": "Place the turkey legs into a large saucepan, pour in enough water to barely cover, and add the bouillon cubes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook until the water has nearly evaporated, about 30 minutes. Place the red bell peppers, tomatoes, onion, habanero peppers, garlic, and tomato paste into a blender, and blend until the vegetables are pureed. Be careful because the habanero peppers are very hot -- don't touch your eyes after handling peppers.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat, and pour the blended mixture into the oil. Reduce heat and simmer until the oil separates and the sauce begins to fry, about 30 minutes; stir the turkey into the sauce, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes to blend the flavors. Season to taste with salt.",
