    "des": "\"This is the 1999 American Pie Council's National Pie Championship first place winner in the Apple Pie Category. Transparent apples are a type of green apple, and are not always readily available.  In that case, Granny Smith apples may be used for all six apples.\"",
    "ins": "Place apple slices into a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup flour, 1/3 cup sugar, and cinnamon, and then sprinkle over apples. Cover, and let sit overnight in refrigerator.\nWhen you are ready to make the pie, begin by making the pastry.  In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups flour and salt. Cut in the shortening and 2 tablespoons butter until the mixture is the consistency of cornmeal. Make a well in the center of the mixture, and add cold water. Stir together to form a ball.  Let rest 20 minutes.\nRoll out dough, and place in pie pan. Spread apple mixture into the pastry lined pan, and dot with 1 tablespoon butter. Cover with top crust, and seal the edges. Cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush half-and-half over the top crust. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.\nBake in a preheated 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Continue cooking for 30 to 40 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.",
