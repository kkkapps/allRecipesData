    "des": "\"This spiced applesauce is an amazing way to start the morning. I love it by itself or as a healthy topping for oatmeal, yogurt, or cottage cheese. I try to eat gluten- and sugar-free food as much as possible while keeping it delicious and full of flavor. This simple recipe is an easy choice! Agave nectar is a fantastic natural sweetener that is low carb and low glycemic index. It is about twice as sweet as sugar so use it in moderation. Use twice the amount of sugar if you are going to substitute. I like my apples tart, so feel free to sweeten to taste.\"",
    "ins": "Mix apples, water, lemon juice, and agave nectar in a pot over medium heat; season with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently, and cook until the apples soften, about 15 minutes. Use a potato masher or a large fork to mash apples to desired consistency.\nRemove pot from heat and allow applesauce to cool. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold.",
