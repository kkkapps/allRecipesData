    "des": "\"This is our rendition of a protein bar to have for quick meal/snack options that you can make at home. We really liked this one... not too sweet. We use fruit juice sweetened dried cranberries. You can set aside some of the nut mixture if you'd like to put on top, but it makes for messy bars.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 220 degrees F (104 degrees C). Arrange walnuts and pecans on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until nuts are roasted and fragrant, about 30 minutes. Remove nuts from oven. Increase oven temperature to 230 degrees F (110 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.\nPulse roasted walnuts, roasted pecans, and almonds together in a food processor until mixture is resembles a coarse meal; transfer to a large bowl. Add pumpkin seeds, cranberries, protein powder, dates, raisins, coconut flour, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and molasses; mix well. Press mixture into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes.",
