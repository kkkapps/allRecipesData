    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners. Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.\nBeat the butter, honey, and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing until just incorporated.\nFill each muffin cup about 1/3 full. Place a banana slice onto the batter in each cup and top with about 1/2 teaspoon of peanut butter, pressing down slightly to cover the banana. Continue to fill each muffin cup with batter, until the cup is 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
