    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nStir almond flour, tapioca flour, 1/2 cup coconut sugar, coconut flour, baking powder, and sea salt together in a bowl using a fork to break any lumps of baking powder. Cut butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter.\nBeat eggs, coconut cream, vanilla extract, cardamom, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl until smooth; pour into the flour mixture and stir with a spatula just until evenly moistened and sticky. Gently fold diced peach into the mixture.\nShape the dough into a ball and move to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle coconut sugar over the top of the dough ball. Press dough into a somewhat flattened disc.\nBake in preheated oven until surface is dried, about 10 minutes. Cut the disc into 8 wedges and continue baking until golden brown on top, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool on sheet for 5 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.",
