    "des": "\"This is an easy slow cooker recipe. This dish ranks as one of my family's favorite Sunday meals. Serve over cooked rice, using sauce as a gravy. My family is picky so I cut the green pepper and celery in larger pieces so I can pick them out before I serve the meal. It doesn't change the flavor, but my kids don't complain about the icky green stuff.\"",
    "ins": "Season ribs with salt and pepper to taste. In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, brown ribs on all sides.\nPlace half of the onion, green pepper, and celery in the bottom of a slow cooker. Place half of the ribs on top the vegetables, then repeat layering with the remaining vegetables and ribs. In a medium bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Pour mixture over the top of the ribs.\nCover, and cook on High for 1 hour. Reduce to Low, and cook for another 8 to 9 hours.",
