    "des": "\"Italian beef prepared with pantry ingredients. This is wonderful for Super Bowl and parties!  Adjustable according to how spicy you like it. I serve it on sub rolls with mozzarella cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Place the roast in a 3 1/2 quart slow-cooker, and add the pickled mixed vegetables, pepperoncini, Italian dressing mix, and beef broth. Stir to blend, cover, and cook on low for 18 hours (yes, 18 hours - a light timer works well if you don't want to stay up until midnight to turn it on).\nTo serve, remove roast from the slow cooker. If necessary, slice it for sandwiches, but it usually just falls apart. Place the pickled vegetables and pepperoncini in a bowl to serve along with the meat.",
