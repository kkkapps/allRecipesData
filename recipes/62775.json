    "des": "\"This delicious gelatin salad is great for Christmas because of it's green color but so refreshing to eat on a hot summer evening.  Just a little cucumber makes it not too overwhelming.  I prefer using salad dressing but you can substitute mayonnaise.  The longer it sits in the refrigerator the better it is.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the gelatin mix into a medium bowl, and stir in the boiling water. Set aside to cool slightly.\nIn a blender or large food processor, combine the cream cheese, salad dressing, cucumber, pickle, and onion. Process until fairly smooth. Stir into the gelatin mixture. Pour into a mold, or leave in the bowl. Refrigerate for 3 hours, or until firm.",
