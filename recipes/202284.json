    "ins": "Whisk together the orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, cilantro, garlic powder, chipotle powder, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag; add the chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat.\nLightly oil the grill grate, and then arrange chicken on grill. Cook the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes per side.",
