    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the spelt flour, sesame seeds, salt, molasses, baking soda and milk until well blended. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.\nBake for 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Placing a tin of the same size over the top of the loaf while baking gives it a lovely crust.",
