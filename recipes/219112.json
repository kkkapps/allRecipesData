    "des": "\"This recipe is inspired by the retro classic cocktail meatballs in grape jelly. I took that idea, along with my love of spicy orange beef, and came up with this combination.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the bison, garlic, breadcrumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl until evenly combined; divide the mixture into 24 portions and roll into balls.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the meatballs until nicely browned on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes.\nAdd the chili sauce, orange marmalade, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and water to the skillet. Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the sauce thickens, about 1 hour.",
