    "des": "\"This is a hot soup from India made with pineapple and lime juice, enhanced with the flavors of ginger, green chile peppers, and cumin seeds. It smells and tastes so good that you could just keep drinking. Good with rice. Tip: Roll limes against a hard surface with the palm of your hand to make them soft. This helps get the juice out.\"",
    "ins": "Use a blender to grind the ginger, 1 teaspoon cumin, and green chile peppers.\nIn a medium saucepan, add 1 cup water, pineapple, tomato, and salt. Place over a low heat. When the pineapple and water have come to boil, add the ground mixture. Raise and lower the heat to bring to a boil several times. Add the remaining water, and bring to a boil again. Add cilantro, and remove from heat. Mix in lime juice.\nIn a small pan, heat oil over medium heat, and add the remaining cumin seeds. Fry till golden, and add to the soup as a garnish.",
