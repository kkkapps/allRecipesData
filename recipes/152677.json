    "des": "\"So simple and so delicious you'll want to make an extra one for the next day. It's always the requested dish to bring to parties, from picnics to Thanksgiving. You don't know whether to eat it as a side dish or dessert, but it will be gone either way. My mom calls it 'white trash souffle' because it's best made with that long-lasting, favorite white bread! If desired, garnish with pineapple slices or maraschino cherries.\"",

Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in the bread cubes and pineapple until well blended. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over the top.\nBake in preheated oven until bread points on top are golden brown, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool before serving.",
