    "des": "\"More method than recipe, I heated up my panini maker one night to make a grilled cheese, only to find out that I'd left the waffle plates inside. Instead of changing out the plates, I used them anyway and I loved the outcome. The sandwich gets super crispy but the cheese is still soft and gooey inside the little squares. It's my 'go to' method for grilled cheese now. Serve with spicy pickled veggies on the side!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.\nMix mayonnaise and Dijon mustard together in a bowl; spread onto 1 side of each bread slice. Sprinkle pepperjack cheese over mayo-mustard layer of 2 bread slices. Cover cheese layer with a second bread slice, creating 2 whole sandwiches.\nPlace 1 sandwich in the waffle iron, taking care not to push down all the way. Wait until the bread begins to soften from the heat before starting to gently close the waffle iron, about 2 minutes. Apply more pressure to the top part of the iron, eventually closing it after a total of 3 to 4 minutes. Cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining sandwich.",
