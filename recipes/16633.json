Set bacon aside.\nAdd mushrooms to skillet and saute for 3 to 4 minutes over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and add the chicken, artichoke hearts, soup, cream, olives, Parmesan cheese, garlic and salt and pepper to taste.\nWhen this mixture begins to simmer, slowly stir in feta cheese. Crumble the bacon into the skillet and let all simmer, stirring often, for 5 to 10 minutes.",
