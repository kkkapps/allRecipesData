    "des": "\"Don't be turned off by the idea of 'just' salt and pepper.  The marinade is intense with flavor, but it's the final seasoning of simple salt and pepper that really makes it delicious. Gotta use Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper here, please don't bother with the regular stuff.  Such a difference.\"",
    "ins": "Place the garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey and cardamom in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken thighs in the bag, and squeeze to coat. Press out most of the air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the marinade, and discard the marinade. Place chicken on a broiling pan or baking sheet. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nRoast in the oven for 40 minutes, or until chicken is browned and crisp, and cooked through.",
