Not only is it great to come home to a hot delicious meal...your home will smell wonderful too!  It is great with the extra gravy spooned over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Place the beef brisket into a slow cooker. In a medium bowl, mix together the chili sauce, onion soup mix, and garlic powder. Pour over the brisket. Cover, and cook on the Low setting for 8 to 10 hours. Slice the brisket against the grain, and pour the gravy over the slices.",
