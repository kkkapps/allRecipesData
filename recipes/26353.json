    "des": "\"I love orange roughy. This is a nameless recipe I just came up with using things I had on hand. It is made in a skillet, but no frying here. If you wish to omit the feta, create another distinct flavor by mixing 1/2 pound chopped mushrooms with the white wine and tomatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in green onions, and cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMix white wine and tomatoes with the green onions, and bring to a boil. Place orange roughy fillets in the white wine mixture. Season with basil, pepper, thyme, and rosemary. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Remove fish fillets from skillet.\nSprinkle fish fillets with black olives and feta cheese.",
