    "ins": "Score top and bottom of meat with a 1 1/2 inch square pattern, and score the side.  Sprinkle meat liberally with unseasoned meat tenderizer, then pierce with fork 1/8 inch apart and at least half-way through the meat on both sides.  Sprinkle lightly with water, and rub in tenderizer. Place on a plate, cover, and set aside for an hour.\nIn a small bowl, mix together oil, lemon juice, seasoned salt, lemon pepper, garlic, parsley, and tarragon vinegar.  Pour marinade over meat, reserving a portion to be used for brushing (Note: DO NOT mix the reserved marinade with the meat; set aside for later). Pour remaining marinade over meat, recover dish and refrigerate for three hours, turning every half hour.\nPreheat grill for hot heat.\nLightly oil grate, and position it 2 inches above the coals.   Place meat on grill, and cook for 5 minutes.  Turn meat over, brush with marinade, and cook for another 5 minutes.",
