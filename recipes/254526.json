    "des": "\"I have become a big fan of the healthy bitter melon and grow them in my garden. My only problem is that a lot of the really good recipes out there contain exotic ingredients that I don't normally have on hand. So I started creating my own simple recipes to complement this wonderful fruit. I hope you will enjoy. Cut into slices to serve.\"",
    "ins": "Mix bitter melon and 1 tablespoon salt together in a bowl. Let stand until water is drawn out of bitter melon, about 20 minutes. Rinse melon; squeeze out excess moisture with your hands.\nHeat butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bitter melon, zucchini, bell pepper, sweet onion, and garlic in the skillet until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain excess liquid; return vegetables to skillet.\nCombine eggs, sour cream, Parmesan cheese, melted butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl; stir until combined. Pour egg mixture over vegetable mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until eggs are set but still very moist, 5 to 8 minutes. Top with Cheddar cheese; cover and turn off heat. Allow to rest until eggs have set and cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.",
