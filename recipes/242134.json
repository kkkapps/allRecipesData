Top cod with spinach, tomato, and onion; season again with salt and black pepper. Drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar over cod and top with mozzarella cheese. Fold foil over cod creating a packet, crimping the edges together making a seal.\nCook on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes.",
