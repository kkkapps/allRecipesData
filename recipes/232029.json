    "des": "\"Bacon-wrapped scallops lightly marinated in a teriyaki, fresh grated ginger, and brown sugar sauce.  These are always a huge hit at every party I go to. They disappear fast and then I'm always asked for the recipe. I often hear comments such as, What an awesome combination!!! and These are so additive!!\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil.\nWhisk teriyaki sauce, brown sugar, and ginger in a bowl.\nWrap each piece of scallop with a strip of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Dip each bacon wrapped scallop in the teriyaki sauce mixture and arrange on one of the prepared baking sheets.\nBroil in preheated oven until lightly charred, about 6 minutes. Flip scallops and transfer to the clean baking sheet and return scallops to the oven. Continue to broil until bacon is charred on the second side, about 6 minutes more.",
