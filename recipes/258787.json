In a small, bowl whisk together olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, 2 tablespoons parsley, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Pour mixture over vegetables. Seal bag; turn several times to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours. Drain vegetables, discarding marinade. Thread vegetables on eight 10- to 12-inch skewers*, leaving 1/4 inch between pieces.\nFor a gas or charcoal grill, grill skewers on the rack of a covered grill directly over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes or until tender and lightly charred, turning occasionally. Garnish with additional parsley.",
