    "ins": "Bring 2 cups water, quinoa, and bouillon granules to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Spread quinoa onto a baking sheet and refrigerate until cooled, about 30 minutes. Rinse saucepan.\nPlace lima beans into the saucepan and add enough water to cover beans by 1 inch; season with salt and pepper. Cover saucepan with a lid and bring water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until beans are cooked through but still tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain water and rinse beans under cold water to stop the cooking process; refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes.\nCook and stir almonds in a skillet over medium heat until toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool almonds to room temperature, about 5 minutes.\nMix quinoa, lima beans, almonds, tomatoes, scallions, and mozzarella cheese together in a large bowl.\nWhisk vinegar, almond oil, olive oil, Italian seasoning, basil, garlic, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; pour over quinoa mixture and stir to coat.",
