    "des": "\"This dish leaves even the biggest pasta lover satisfied. Fresh vegetables make this dish wonderful and it's easy to add meat to if you wish. The first time I made it, my husband fell in love and everyone wanted the recipe. This dish is great topped with a small amount of shredded cheese. I recommend Gouda.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the tomatoes on a baking sheet with the cut sides facing up.\nRoast the tomatoes in the preheated oven until cooked through and slightly browned on the underside, about 15 minutes.\nPlace squash halves face down in glass baking dish with the water; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on High for 8 minutes. Leave covered and set aside. Once the squash is cool enough to handle, scrape in strands into a large bowl with a fork; season with salt and pepper and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nHeat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir the garlic, basil, and Italian seasoning in the oil until the garlic is softened, about 10 minutes. Add the onion, green bell pepper, eggplant, and carrot to the garlic; increase heat to medium. Continue cooking and stirring until the vegetables are nearly tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix the tomatoes and white wine into the vegetable mixture; cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the spaghetti squash; gently toss together.",
