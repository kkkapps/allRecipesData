    "ins": "Melt the butter with the minced scallions. Combine the melted butter with the bread crumbs, tarragon, parsley, salt and ground pepper. Add sherry or giblet stock to desired moistness (2 cups is usually plenty).\nPack stuffing into bird's cavity. Remove stuffing promptly once bird is cooked. Alternately you can bake the stuffing in a large casserole dish at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour 20 minutes.",
