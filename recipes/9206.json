    "des": "\"This sounds like such a simple recipe that many people pass it up ...DON'T! Cooking new potatoes this way makes them taste wonderful, especially with gobs of fresh butter. You must have a cast iron pan to do this. The stove-top browning makes the skins crunchy and out of this world. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com. \"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes in the bottom of a large cast iron skillet. Place about 2 tablespoons of water in the bottom of the pot and sprinkle with the salt. Cover tightly and place over low heat. Cook for 40-50 minutes. Do not lift the lid during this time. Occasionally give the pan a shake.",
