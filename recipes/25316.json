    "ins": "In a large saucepan cover rice with water and let stand for 30 minutes.\nIn a shallow dish combine soy sauce, honey and garlic.  In this mixture marinate tofu for at least 30 minutes.\nBring water and rice to a boil and then reduce heat; simmer for about 20 minutes, or until thick and sticky.  In a large glass bowl combine cooked rice with rice vinegar.\nPlace a sheet of nori on a bamboo mat.  Working with wet hands, spread 1/4 of the rice evenly over the nori; leave about 1/2 inch on the top edge of the nori.  Place 2 strips of marinated tofu end to end about 1 inch from the bottom.  Place 2 strips of cucumber next to the tofu, then avocado and carrot.\nRoll nori tightly from the bottom, using the mat to help make a tight roll.  Seal by moistening with water the 1/2 inch at the top.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Slice with a serrated knife into 1 inch thick slices.",
