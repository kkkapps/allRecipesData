Spread batter into prepared pan.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool in the pan.\nCombine 6 tablespoons butter or margarine, milk, and 1 1/4 cups sugar in a saucepan.  Stir and boil for 3 minutes.  Add 1 Cup chocolate chips, and stir over low heat until melted.  Frost cooled brownies immediately so frosting does not cool and harden.  Cut into bars.",
