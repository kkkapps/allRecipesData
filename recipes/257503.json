    "ins": "Place bread flour, milk, eggs, sugar, butter, yeast, salt, and saffron in a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.\nProgram the bread machine for the dough cycle; press \"Start.\" Mix raisins into the dough by hand after the cycle is complete.\nDivide dough into 9 pieces. Roll each piece into a log 6 to 7 inches long. Pinch the ends of 3 logs together and form a 3-strand braid. Pinch ends together at the bottom of the braid. Repeat with remaining logs to make 2 more braided loaves.\nTransfer loaves to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, placing them several inches apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until loaves are a light golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
