Refrigerate until set, 2 to 4 hours.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCover filled baking pan with aluminum foil; place on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour enough boiling water into baking sheet to reach halfway up the sides of baking pan.\nBake in preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Remove from water bath carefully; cool until set, about 5 minutes.",
