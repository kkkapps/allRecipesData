    "ins": "For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .\nFor crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt.   Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.\nKnead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic.  Add more flour, if needed.  (If using RapidRise(R) Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)\nDivide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.\nFor pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.\nBake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly.  For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.",
