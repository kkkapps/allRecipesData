    "des": "\"This is an OLD recipe for eggnog pie. The recipe calls for making eggnog from scratch like my grandmother used to. You can put this in a traditional crust or Pecan Nut Crust from this site. Boiling the rum before adding to the recipe will remove almost all the alcohol. This really is an easy pie to make, and once you get the hang of it you can just about make it with your eyes closed! I guarantee rave reviews at Thanksgiving or Christmas!\"",
    "ins": "Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup dark rum to soften for about 10 minutes.\nBeat egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer until the egg mixture falls like ribbon off the beaters, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue mixing on medium-high speed, and pour in scalded milk in a thin stream, mixing constantly.\nTransfer mixture into a saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard coats a spoon, about 20 minutes. Do not allow to boil. Take the pan off the heat, and transfer to a bowl. Stir in softened gelatin mixture and vanilla, stirring until gelatin is completely melted. Chill custard over a bowl of ice until room temperature. Stir occasionally; do not let the custard set up.\nBeat egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff but not dry; set aside. Whip 3/4 cup heavy cream until medium-stiff peaks form. Gently fold whipped cream into the whipped egg whites. Fold in custard. Spread filling into prepared pie crust. Chill for 45 minutes in the refrigerator, or until filling is set.\nCombine 1 cup chilled whipping cream, confectioner's sugar, 2 to 3 tablespoons rum, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Whip until soft peaks form.  Spread over the top of the chilled pie, mounding in an attractive fashion.  Dust the top of the pie with additional nutmeg.",
