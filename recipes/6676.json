Add mixture to yeast, and stir in flour. The last 3 cups of flour will have to be mixed in by hand.\nCover dough with a damp cloth, and place in refrigerator.  Punch down occasionally as dough rises.  You can leave dough in refrigerator overnight.\nTwo hours before baking, shape the dough into rolls.  Place on greased pans, baking trays or muffin pans.  Let rise 2 hours.\nBake at 400 degrees F ( 205 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes.",
