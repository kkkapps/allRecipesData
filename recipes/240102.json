    "des": "\"This is a hearty and healthy vegetarian/vegan recipe that a friend made for us when we had him over. You can season the mixture any way you see fit, but I've found the cumin really gives it a nice kick. Enjoy! Tastes great cooled as well!\"",
    "ins": "Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir broccoli in hot oil until tender yet still crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir sweet potatoes, lentils, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt into broccoli; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Add diced tomatoes and cook until hot, about 3 minutes.\nDrizzle 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce into each pita round. Scoop about 1 cup of sweet potato mixture into each pita and wrap each, folding up the bottom of the pita first, followed by the sides. Secure with toothpicks, if necessary.",
