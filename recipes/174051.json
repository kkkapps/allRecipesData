    "des": "\"This zingy version of a classic recipe, introducing pesto and kalamata olives, is sure to make your mouth water - and you'll reexamine the idea of the same old tuna salad.\"",
    "ins": "Lightly stir together the tuna, mayonnaise, pesto, lemon juice, and pepper in a bowl until well combined.\nMicrowave the tortilla on High until warmed and pliable, 5 to 10 seconds.\nSpread the tuna mixture on the tortilla, and top with the lettuce leaves, provolone cheese, and kalamata olives. Fold the bottom of the tortilla up about 2 inches to enclose the filling, and roll the tortilla tightly into a compact wrap.",
