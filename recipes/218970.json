    "des": "\"This is a farm-style French dish that my Mom's German grandmother taught her to make as a young girl. It's easy and similar to our pot roast meals and very tasty as well. Mom updated the one she had to make it even easier for us to make years later. She made enough to make a different meal with her leftovers as well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour the olive oil into the bottom of a heavy Dutch oven, and place over medium heat. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and black pepper, and cook in the hot oil until browned on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Add the carrots, potatoes, celery, onion, garlic, chicken bouillon cubes, and water, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, and cover the Dutch oven.\nPlace the Dutch oven into the preheated oven, and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.",
