    "des": "\"This is a fun way to serve the classic mac and cheese. Cheddar cheese is melted and formed into crisp waffle cone and mac and cheese is poured in. I made this for a few kids and they loved it...gotta love cheese though.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nSprinkle Cheddar cheese onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges start to brown and cheese is bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature. Cut melted cheese into squares and form into cones. Freeze cones for 5 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix milk, butter, pepperoni, salt, and cheese packet into pasta until evenly combined.\nFill cheese cones with macaroni and cheese.",
