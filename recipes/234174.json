    "des": "\"These tartines are assembled on long slices of crisply toasted baguette topped with a mash of garlic and herb Boursin\u00c2\u00ae, cut with ricotta and goat cheese to make it spreadable. On top, chopped tomatoes, sweet and crunchy, with a drizzle of olive oil, basil, salt and pepper. I love these for lunch or even breakfast. Satisfying, but uncomplicated.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRub 1 side of each baguette slice with the cut-side of halved garlic and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Arrange baguettes slices, oil-side up, on a baking sheet.\nPlace baking sheet on the middle rack of preheated oven and bake until baguette slices are golden, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, leaving oven on.\nToss tomatoes, basil, and minced garlic together with 4 teaspoons olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper in a bowl until coated.\nMix goat cheese, garlic and herb cheese spread, and ricotta cheese together in a separate bowl. Spread cheese mixture onto cooled baguette slices; top with tomato mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.",
