    "des": "\"This zesty meatball recipe is always a hit with any crowd. The basic, two-ingredient sauce can be switched up by simply combining Heinz Chili Sauce with any sweet spread such as peach jam, grape jelly or mango chutney. And, for the ultimate shortcut, you can use prepared meatballs.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Gently blend beef, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, onion, garlic, salt and pepper until evenly combined. Form into about 40 bite-sized meatballs.\nPlace meatballs on a foil-lined, rimmed baking sheet; bake for 20 minutes or until cooked all the way through.\nCombine chili sauce and jelly in a saucepan set over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until jelly dissolves, about 5 minutes.\nAdd cooked meatballs to the sauce; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Makes 8 servings.",
