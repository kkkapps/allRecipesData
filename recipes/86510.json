Cook in the microwave for 4 more minutes. Add the uncooked rice, and stir to coat with oil. Cook for another 4 minutes.\nPour the simmering chicken broth into the rice, and stir. Cook in the microwave for 9 minutes. Stir, then microwave for another 9 minutes. If you want a creamier risotto, add 1/4 cup of warm water, and cook for another 2 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan cheese as soon as it comes out of the microwave, and serve.",
