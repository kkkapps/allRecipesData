    "des": "\"Chicken and veggies in a creamy sauce. I created this as an alternative to using canned cream soups. I had a tube of Pillsbury\u00c2\u00ae crescent roll dough, so I used that as a crust. It was okay, but I will use a regular pie crust (store-bought or scratch) the next time. My husband loved the chicken/veggie filling; it's a keeper.\"",

Add frozen vegetable mix, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMelt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and celery in hot butter until soft and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMelt remaining butter in a pot over medium-high heat.
