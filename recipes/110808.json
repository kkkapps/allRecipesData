    "des": "\"A heavenly, decadent kugel recipe that I have had since my college days when my roommate begged several vendors at a San Antonio Oktoberfest to share their delicious kugel recipes with us.  From these recipes, we combined and created our amazing Lieblich Noodle Kugel.  I have taken this dish to countless events with family and friends, and it receives rave reviews every single time!\"",
