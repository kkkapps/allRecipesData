    "des": "\"This quick orange cake is delicious without the frosting. I sometimes just sprinkle icing sugar on the top. This recipe can be used to make two 8-inch cake layers or a 9x5-inch loaf. If making a loaf cake, bake for 60 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans.\nIn a measuring cup, combine milk, 1/2 cup orange juice, oil, beaten eggs, and 1 1/2 teaspoon orange zest. Set aside.\nSift flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl. Mix in sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk mixture. Stir until thoroughly combined.\nDivide batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.\nTo make Orange Butter Frosting: Cream butter until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar. Beat until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 tablespoons orange juice to bring to spreading consistency. Stir in vanilla and 1 teaspoon orange zest.",
