    "des": "\"I created this recipe after tasting some divine braised greens at a wonderful soul food restaurant in Kansas City. I wanted to recreate the flavor at home. This is  recipe is wonderful with fresh greens or frozen or fresh green beans.  Even picky eaters devour these with their slightly smoky, slightly sweet, slightly tangy flavor. My family gobbles them up! Try this recipe with 3 to 4 bunches of greens instead of green beans, too.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon in hot oil until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.\nStir vinegar, sugar, and garlic into the bacon and onion mixture; season with salt and pepper.  Pour chicken stock over the mixture and stir; bring to a simmer and cook until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the green beans and toss to coat. Cover the pot and let the green beans simmer until tender, about 10 minutes more.",
