    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the margarine, shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.\nTo make the Maple-Flavored Seven Minute Frosting:  In a saucepan, heat maple syrup until boiling. Let boil for an additional 5 minutes. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually pour in hot maple syrup, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.",
