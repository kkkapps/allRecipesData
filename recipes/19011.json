    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nFor icing:  In small saucepan, melt chocolate and 1 tablespoon butter over low heat.  Remove from heat and, with electric mixer, beat in confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons hot water.  Beat until smooth.  Drizzle over filled eclairs.\nFor shells: In medium saucepan bring 1 cup water to a boil, stir in 1/2 cup butter and salt.  Stir until melted.  Add flour all at once and stir vigorously until mixture forms a ball.  Remove from heat and beat in eggs, one at a time, until smooth.  Drop by tablespoons onto baking sheet.\nBake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until golden, 10 to 15 minutes.  Cool completely.\nFor filling:  In large bowl, beat 1/2 cup of milk, a little at a time, into softened cream cheese, until creamy.  Beat in remaining 1 1/2 cups milk and pudding mix.  Stir until thick, 1 to 2 minutes.  Cut tops off cooled pastry shells and fill.  Replace tops.",
