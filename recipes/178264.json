    "des": "\"I threw this together one night after I realized my saucepan wasn't big enough for my Thai Chicken, and I needed to quickly transfer it into a large pot. I added more ingredients then slow cooked it for a bit longer. Was a big hit with my Filipino friends. Bear in mind, the different types of vegetables can be lessened, increased, or omitted, based on preference. Serve over white rice.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the sesame oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat; add the chicken, lemon juice, and soy sauce; cook and stir until the chicken is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.\nWhisk together the coconut milk, curry paste, and flour in a bowl until smooth; pour into the skillet. Add the bell pepper, sweet onion, red onion, garlic, potatoes, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and mushrooms; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes. Stir in cilantro and remove from heat.",
