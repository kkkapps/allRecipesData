Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 15 minutes.\nRemove the soup from the heat, and puree in a food processor or blender in batches. Return to the saucepan, and whisk in yogurt. Heat through, but do not boil. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. Ladle into bowls, and float a lemon slice on top of each serving.",
