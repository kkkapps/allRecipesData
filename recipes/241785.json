    "ins": "Blend chia seeds in a blender until powdery, 3 to 5 seconds. Add banana, eggs, flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and sea salt; blend, occasionally scraping sides down, until batter is smooth.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat; add coconut oil. Pour 1/2 of the batter into the hot oil and sprinkle 1/2 of the blueberries onto the batter. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter and blueberries, using more coconut oil if needed.",
