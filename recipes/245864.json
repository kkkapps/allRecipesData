    "des": "\"The first thing I do when I visit my favorite Thai restaurant is ponder the specials board. On my one of my recent visits, they had avocado curry. I had never thought of mixing a decadent coconut curry with a delicious avocado. After all, delicious fat plus more delicious fat is always a win. So I ordered it, made mental notes along the way and whipped up a batch the very next day. One tweaking batch later, and I've arrived at this. Serve over rice or noodles.\"",
    "ins": "Blend coconut milk, 1/2 avocado, 1/2 cup water, seasoning sauce, curry paste, and lime juice in a blender until smooth, adding more water if curry is too thick. Pour curry into a large saucepan and bring to a boil.\nStir green beans, tempeh, and carrot into curry; reduce heat to medium. Cover saucepan and cook until beans and carrots are soft, about 15 minutes. Remove cover and add remaining 1/2 avocado, zucchini, and basil; cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 2 minutes more.",
