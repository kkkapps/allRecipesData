    "des": "\"These are absolutely melt in your mouth delicious! You can make them on the grill or in the oven. Even friends of ours that don't care for onions loved these! I would recommend that you use 1 large onion for every 2 people. Some people want one whole onion to themselves so you might want to make some extra! They are also good heated up the next day but we rarely have any extra!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.\nPlace the onion wedges on a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil. Dot with butter, then sprinkle with bouillon, garlic salt, and pepper to taste. Fold the aluminum foil into a packet, leaving only a small hole at the top to allow steam to escape.\nPlace packet on preheated grill, and cook until the onions have softened, and cooked to a deep, rich brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on the temperature of the grill. Stir the onions after the first 30 minutes, or as needed to keep from burning.",
