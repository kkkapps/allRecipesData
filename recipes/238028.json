    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe, since it's hard to find quick-and-easy snacks without gluten or peanuts. These bars are so good that even my friends who don't have food allergies love them! If you have tree-nut allergies, you can substitute sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds. There are so many variations on this recipe!\"",

Turn oat mixture out into the prepared baking dish and press down until evenly spread out and compact.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
