    "des": "\"This is a traditional roast chicken dish from Algeria. The sauce is a combination of onions, garlic, mustard, balsamic vinegar, and cayenne pepper. When I have time, I prepare the chicken a few hours ahead of time and let it marinate in the sauce before roasting it in the oven. I usually serve the chicken with cubed roast potatoes. I coat them with the same sauce and cook them in the oven for 1 hour.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix water, onion, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt together in a roasting dish. Add chicken; turn until well coated with mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour 30 minutes.",
