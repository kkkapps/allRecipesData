    "des": "\"One of my favorite recipes! I love jalapenos and make these when nothing else hits the spot. Topped with sour cream or ranch dressing and chopped fresh chives, this is a great appetizer or snack. Serve with homemade sangria. Also great on the grill.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nPlace bacon in a skillet over medium heat, working in batches, and cook until bacon is translucent and still flexible, about 2 minutes per side. Set bacon aside.\nTrim membranes from jalapeno pepper halves to reduce heat. Rinse peppers and set aside.\nPlace whipped cream cheese and Cheddar cheese into a bowl and mix until well blended; stir in Worcestershire sauce. Spoon cheese mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large tip. Pipe the cheese filling generously into the pepper halves. Top each filled pepper with a precooked bacon strip and arrange onto prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese filling is bubbling and the bacon strips are lightly browned, 8 to 14 minutes. Serve hot.",
