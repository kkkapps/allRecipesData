    "des": "\"This version of rice pudding uses brown rice, cinnamon, and almond extract to make a slightly nutty comfort dessert. My mother adds raisins during the last 15 minutes; she calls this 'Speckled Pup,' but I prefer my rice pudding without raisins.\"",
    "ins": "Bring the water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Add the salt, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.\nStir the milk, evaporated milk, almond extract, and sugar into the rice; add the cinnamon stick. Simmer uncovered, stirring frequently, until the dish is of pudding consistency, about 70 minutes more.",
