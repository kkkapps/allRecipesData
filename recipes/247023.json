    "des": "\"This is a fresh and modern take on two recipes from my Italian mother-in-law.  Fresh peas in place of canned, sun dried tomatoes in place of heavy tomato sauce and Bumble Bee\u00c2\u00ae Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water replacing tuna in oil. This is a fast and flavorful meal to put together with just a few shelf stable ingredients.\"",
    "ins": "Place the oil from the sun dried tomatoes in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add in onions and garlic. Cook over medium heat until onions begin to turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the broth to the onions and bring to a simmer.\nStir in the peas and the sun dried tomatoes. Cook for another 3 minutes.  Peas should remain crisp so be careful not to over cook.\nStir in undrained tuna and heat through. Be careful not to break up too many large pieces of the tuna while stirring. Cook about 2-3 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and crushed red pepper if desired.\nServe immediately over hot pasta. Garnish with parsley and top with grated Parmesan cheese.",
