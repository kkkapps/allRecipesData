    "des": "\"This may sound odd, but tripe, when properly prepared, is an amazing thing! With the milk bath, and the harsh heat of frying, it loses quite a bit of its intimidating harsh flavor. This is a fun appetizer for your pork lovers, and will have them guessing as to what part of the porker you just fried! The sauce uses the traditional combo for any recipe that is deviled: mustard, cayenne pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Combine tripe and 1/2 gallon milk in a non-reactive bowl. Let soak in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.\nDrain milk and rinse tripe. Return to the bowl and cover with remaining 1/2 gallon milk. Add onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Let soak in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.\nMix sour cream, scallions, Worcestershire sauce, English mustard, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl to make dipping sauce. Chill until flavors combine, at least 1 hour.\nDrain tripe, discarding milk, onion, garlic, and bay leaves. Rinse tripe and pat dry with paper towels. Cut into tortilla chip-sized triangles.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry tripe in batches until puffed and golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.\nServe dipping sauce alongside fried tripe.",
