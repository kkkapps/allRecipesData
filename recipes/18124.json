    "des": "\"This is a very old recipe. Serve these flavorful scones warm with butter. They may be a little heavy but you can lighten them up by using an egg in place of some of the milk if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nIn a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, cream of tarter, salt, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. Cut in butter with a fork or pastry blender. Combine milk and molasses in a small bowl; stir into flour mixture until moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Roll dough out into a 1/2 inch thick round. Cut out circles with a medium biscuit cutter and place pieces on prepared baking sheet so that they are barely touching.\nBake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Move to a wire rack to cool slightly before serving. For soft scones, cover with a dry cloth for 10 minutes. For crisp scones, do not cover.",
