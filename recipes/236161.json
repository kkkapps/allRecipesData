    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet.\nCombine flour, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken in bag, seal bag, and shake well. Remove chicken from bag and spread out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nWhisk butter, Sriracha hot sauce, honey, lime juice, soy sauce, and ginger together in a saucepan over medium heat until sauce bubbles, about 5 minutes.\nPlace cooked chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour sauce over chicken. Toss to coat.",
