    "ins": "Blend the coconut, jalapeno pepper, Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, coconut flavored syrup, and water in a blender until liquefied; pour into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook the coconut mixture at a gentle boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool before serving as a condiment for hot dogs.",
