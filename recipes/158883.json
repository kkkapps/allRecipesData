    "des": "\"This cooling Indian dish is perfect as an accompaniment to grilled meats. Curry leaves can be found at your local Indian store. If you can't find them, they can be omitted, but they do add a unique flavor and smell.\"",
    "ins": "Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.\nHeat the ghee in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the broken chile pepper, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the black mustard seeds, and cook until they begin to pop, about 30 seconds more. Remove from the heat, and stir in the turmeric, curry leaves, and asafoetida powder.\nWhisk the milk, yogurt, and spice ghee together in a large bowl until smooth.  Fold in the rice until well mixed. Season to taste with salt, then allow to cool to room temperature before serving.",
