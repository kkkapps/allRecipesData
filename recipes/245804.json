    "des": "\"These pancakes really fill the belly. Freshly milled flour makes all the difference. Soaking or fermenting overnight with non-dairy milk and acid (kombucha, kefir, or lemon juice) ferments the batter and goes easy on the digestion. Serve with syrup or the fresh fruits of your choice.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk oat flour, buckwheat flour, coconut flour, and flaxseed meal together in a small bowl. Pour in almond milk and kombucha; mix well to form a sticky batter. Set aside to soak in a warm spot in the kitchen, 8 hours to overnight.\nBlend batter with banana, baking powder, and baking soda until combined.\nHeat oil in a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Place 1/4 cup of batter in the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
