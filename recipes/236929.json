    "des": "\"This is a tasty, zesty side dish that can easily become a main meal. Serve soupy with warm flour tortillas or crusty bread, crumble corn bread on top, or scoop up with tortilla chips. Like mac and cheese, it's a great comfort food. It is easy to make because it doesn't require constant attention and is good for everything from a family meal to a football party. It can easily be doubled. Check flavor before serving and alter seasonings to taste if necessary. Top with more onion and cilantro as desired. If there are any leftovers, they hold up well and taste great the next day.\"",
