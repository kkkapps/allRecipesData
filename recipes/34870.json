A lovely mix of diced chicken breast, sweet or hot Italian sausage, potatoes, and sliced hot cherry peppers combined with a white wine sauce, then served over a bed of angel hair pasta. The longer its cooked with the hot cherry peppers, the spicier it gets!\"",

Set aside.\nIn a Dutch oven, saute diced onion and Italian sausage in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil until thoroughly cooked.  Stir in chicken.\nMeanwhile, microwave potatoes until done (but not mushy), and cut into cubes (with or without the skin).  Stir into chicken and sausage mixture.\nIn a medium bowl, combine white wine, vinegar, and water.  Pour into sausage mixture, and cook over medium low heat until mixture begins to thicken.  Add hot cherry peppers, and cook until dish reaches desired spiciness (the longer you cook it with the peppers, the spicier it gets!).\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling water until al dente.
