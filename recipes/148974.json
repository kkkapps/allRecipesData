    "des": "\"This is a nice dish to serve guests for dinner or even at a special lunch. It's extremely presentable and will wow everybody at the table. Be sure to use the Japanese mayonnaise recommended in this recipe, not American-style mayonnaise because the flavors are entirely different. Japanese mayonnaise is more flat/sour tasting while American-style mayonnaise is extremely sweet. American-style mayonnaise will ruin the recipe completely.\"",
    "ins": "Melt 1/4 of the 3 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat, add a mushroom cap, and cook on both sides until completely soft to the center, about 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining butter and mushrooms, and place the cooked mushrooms upside-down on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet; sprinkle with garlic powder.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source.\nMelt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the scallops, and cook until just firm, and lightly browned on both sides. Divide scallops among mushroom caps. Stir together mayonnaise and chili sauce in a small bowl, and spoon over the scallops.\nBroil until the mayonnaise has developed brown patches and is hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with green onions to serve.",
