    "des": "\"My husband loves the taste of Ranch tortilla chips. You don't have to use Ranch flavored tortilla chips. Play with different flavors and see what you like best! This is also healthier since you bake it, and clean up is a cinch---just wad up the foil and throw it away!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a cooking sheet with aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.\nIn a shallow dish, mix together crushed chips, chili powder, salt, and pepper.\nIn another bowl, mix egg and oil. Dip catfish in egg and oil mixture, then dredge in chips mixture. Place catfish on foil-lined baking sheet, and sprinkle any leftover chip mixture over the catfish.\nBake in a preheated oven until catfish is flaky and white in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes.",
