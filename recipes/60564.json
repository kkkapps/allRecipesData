    "des": "\"It is hard to find scratch strawberry cakes, so this one is worth it weight in gold to me as a caterer.  I made this cake for a child's birthday party.  It was a major hit! Frost with cream cheese or vanilla frosting - or for a treat, use a chocolate glaze!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and dry strawberry gelatin until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the batter alternately with the milk. Blend in vanilla and strawberry puree. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a small knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cakes to cool in their pans over a wire rack for at least 10 minutes, before tapping out to cool completely.",
