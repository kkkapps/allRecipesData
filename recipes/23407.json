    "des": "\"This was my first scone recipe and I have loved it ever since my mom taught me how to make it.  It has a light cheese flavor which added to for you cheese lovers!  It kind of reminds me of fast food biscuits, but with cheese and without the genetic engineering.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.\nIn a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and cheese. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the butter, milk and water; stir gently to combine. Add water in small amounts until dough pulls together.\nKnead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and press out to 3/4 inch thickness. Cut dough into rounds with a floured 1 1/4 inch cookie or biscuit cutter. Place rounds on prepared tray and sprinkle lightly with cayenne pepper.\nBake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Handle scones gently until complete cool.",
