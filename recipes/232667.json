Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 4 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 6 muffin cups with cooking spray.\nWhisk milk, eggs, maple syrup, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.\nPlace 1 asparagus half and about 1 teaspoon onion into each of the prepared muffin cups. Pour about 1/4 cup egg mixture into each muffin cup; sprinkle each with Swiss cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until frittatas are golden and puffed, about 25 minutes. Remove promptly and let cool only a few minutes, as they will deflate, like a souffle.",
