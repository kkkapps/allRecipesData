    "des": "\"Spinach bites that are allergen-friendly for my little guys. Flour keeps them from sticking and gives them a great crust on the outside. Baking dries up the spinach filling and prevents it from being too gooey.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nRun 1/2 cup spinach through a juicer according to manufacturer's instructions; add to cooled potatoes and mash until smooth.\nPulse remaining spinach in a food processor until finely chopped. Add to mashed potatoes.\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir into mashed potatoes.\nMix water and flaxseed meal together in a small bowl; let sit until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add to mashed potatoes with baking powder and salt; mix to combine. Form into patties. Dust both sides of patties generously with flour.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in batches until a pale crust forms, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and patties. Transfer pan-fried patties to baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes.",
