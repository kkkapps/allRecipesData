    "des": "\"This recipe is adapted from one I found in a Georgian/Russian cookbook. The original recipe was more complex, and called for other ingredients like lamb -- which my family won't eat. This version is a big favorite in our home. The yogurt sauce can be as garlicky as your family likes. We usually go for lots, but we've had guests who like it with plain yogurt.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and transfer to a serving dish. While the pasta is cooking, mix together the yogurt and garlic in a medium bowl. Cover, and refrigerate until serving.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the onion. Season with cinnamon while cooking. Drain off excess grease, and stir in lemon juice and salt. Adjust seasoning to taste. Toss the meat mixture with noodles, and serve hot with cold yogurt sauce spooned over.",
