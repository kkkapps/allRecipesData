    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir apples, Asian pears, and apple cider together in the skillet until the fruit is mushy, about 10 minutes.\nSmash the apples and pears with the back of a wooden spoon until no large chunks remain; continue cooking until thickened, 20 to 30 minutes more.\nStir sugar and cinnamon into the sauce; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely, 5 to 7 minutes more.",
