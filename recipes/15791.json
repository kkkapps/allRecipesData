Add egg and blend until mixture is smooth.\nIn a separate bowl combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix thoroughly, then add to sugar mixture. Stir until well combined. Divide dough in half.\nWith floured fingers press one half of dough into bottom of greased pie plate. Place pie plate in freezer and place other half of dough in refrigerator.\nAfter 20 minutes, remove pie plate from freezer. Spread chocolate hazelnut spread over frozen dough.\nRoll out remaining dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Fit dough on top of chocolate hazelnut layer and press firmly on edges to seal.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes until lightly browned. Cool 5 minutes, then cut into 8 slices.
