    "des": "\"Marinated, pan-cooked Mahi with sauteed mushrooms and grape tomatoes. Serve it with a salad and some bread. YUM! You can marinate overnight; then it only takes a few minutes to get ready before cooking. Oyster mushrooms are my favorites, but criminis work well also. I use both yellow and red grape tomatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the garlic, shallot, red pepper flakes, and 2 tablespoons olive oil together in a shallow dish.\nLay the mahi mahi fillets in the olive oil mixture; turn to coat.\nSeason the fillets with salt and black pepper.\nTransfer the dish to the refrigerator and allow the fillets to marinate 30 minutes to overnight.\nHeat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.\nCook and stir the oyster mushrooms in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes; season with salt and black pepper.\nPour the white wine over the mushrooms; bring to a simmer and allow to cook while you prepare the mahi mahi.\nRemove the mahi mahi fillets from the marinade; shake to remove any excess marinade.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat.\nGently lay the fillets in the hot skillet; cook about 5 minutes. Pour the marinade over the fillets and continue cooking until the fish is just beginning to flake in the center; remove from heat, transfer to a serving dish, and keep warm.\nAdd the tomatoes and butter to the mushroom and wine mixture. Cook and stir together just until the butter has melted; spoon over the mahi mahi fillets to serve.",
