    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice and cloves; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. Mix in the rolled oats alternately with the milk. Finally, stir in the raisins. Drop by heaping spoonfuls 3 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven for 10 to 11 minutes, or until edges are golden and tops are dry. Cool on cookie sheets for 1 minute before removing to cool on wire racks.",
