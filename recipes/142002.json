Remove from heat and drain.\nMix the bread crumbs, cream cheese, parsley, and the bacon mixture in a large bowl; season with pepper to taste.\nPour the tomato puree into a large, shallow casserole dish; stir in the rosemary.\nSpoon the bacon and breadcrumb mixture equally into the pasta shells. Arrange the stuffed shells in the casserole dish. Coarsely chop the mozzarella and scatter over the pasta shells. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce bubbles, about 30 minutes.",
