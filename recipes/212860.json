    "des": "\"These cookies are delicate and crispy, like biting into a crunchy slice of sweet cornbread. You can add vanilla instead of the rum. I just did that to compliment the shredded coconut, and it worked like a charm.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease several baking sheets, or line with parchment paper.\nBeat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until the mixture is soft and creamy. Beat in the egg until well blended. Stir in the cornmeal about 1/4 cup at a time, stirring to blend well after each addition, then stir in the flour, baking soda, lime zest, coconut, salt, and rum until the mixture forms a soft dough. Drop by rounded teaspoons onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges just turn golden, 8 to 12 minutes, and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets before removing. Cookies are very fragile when warm.",
