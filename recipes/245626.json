Add eggs and vanilla extract; mix well until dough comes together and is smooth. If dough is sticky, add more flour.\nRoll out dough on floured work surface until it is about 1/4-inch thick. Press the rim of a glass into flour and then into the dough to cut out circles.\nPlace 1/2 teaspoon filling into the center of each circle. Fold up the 3 sides into a triangle shape, pinching the sides together tightly to seal.
