If you're really health conscious, you can omit the butter and add water to the pan in its place. Cook longer for desired texture; cook less or not at all for a healthier raw dessert.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook apples and parsnip in the melted butter until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir water, brown sugar, and cinnamon into apple-parsnip mixture; cook until sugar dissolves and apple-parsnip mixture has softened, about 5 minutes. Serve warm or cold.",
