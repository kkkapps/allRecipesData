    "des": "\"Coal miners in the Midwest would take these for their lunch. They keep warm rather long wrapped in a towel. Some housewives would stuff one end with a savory filling, and the other with a sweet one. That way you could have your dessert with your dinner! For a true coal miner meal experience, be sure to roughly chop the potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Place the flour, 2 teaspoons of salt, and the lard in a bowl. Quickly rub the lard into the flour with your fingertips until it resembles small peas.  Pour in the ice water, and form into a ball.  Add more water if it feels too dry.  Divide the dough into 6 balls, and wrap in plastic.  Chill one hour.\nIn a bowl, combine the meat, turnips, potatoes, onions, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).\nRoll out one of the balls on a floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick.  Using a cake pan, trace a 9 inch circle in the dough; cut out the circle.  Place about 1 1/2 cups of the meat mixture into the middle of the circle.  Fold the edges of the circle up to meet along the top of the meat filling, and crimp the dough along the top to seal.  Repeat until all dough is used up.  With a spatula, transfer the pasties  to an ungreased sheet.\nBake the pasties for 45 minutes, or until golden.  Serve hot or at room temperature.",
