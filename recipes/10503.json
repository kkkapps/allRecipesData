    "ins": "Mix dry ingredients (except nuts) in a large bowl. Mix the eggs and liquids in a separate bowl. Add liquids to the dry ingredients gradually, mixing until dough is stiff.  Do not overmix.  Stir in or work in the nuts.\nShape dough into two rectangles 3 inches wide, 15 inches long.  Place on greased cookie sheet.\nBake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove baked rectangles from oven and let stand until cool to the touch.\nUsing sharp knife, slice rectangles crosswise into 3/4 inch slices. Place back on cookie sheet, sliced side down, and bake again for 15 minutes or until they are golden brown.  Store in airtight container. These store well for weeks.",
