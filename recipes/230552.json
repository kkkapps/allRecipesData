    "des": "\"This is a simple, fast, and easy holiday cheese ball recipe. It will remind you of your childhood if you are of a vintage age. If you loved the taste of Kraft\u00c2\u00ae pineapple cheese spread on a Ritz\u00c2\u00ae cracker this will really bring back comfort food memories. Makes a great potluck dish for parties. This is a big favorite at the holidays. I like to serve this with Chicken in a Biscuit\u00c2\u00ae type of cracker, but your favorite crackers will do very nicely.\"",
    "ins": "Mix cream cheese and pineapple together in a bowl; form into a ball. Roll ball in walnut pieces until ball is completely coated.\nSet ball on a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap plastic wrap tightly around ball and place in a small bowl. Refrigerate ball to allow flavors to blend, at least 30 minutes.\nServe cheese ball on a bed of chopped parsley.",
