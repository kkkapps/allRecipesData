    "des": "\"Shrimp is sauteed with peppers and sweet onion, and served over a pile of hot cheese grits. I had a variation of this at a local restaurant, added a few things, and made it mine! Garlic bread makes a great side! be sure to have Tabasco on hand to add appropriate spice.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the water and cream in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and stir in the grits. When the grits start to thicken, stir in the processed cheese, and simmer, stirring occasionally until grits are thick and ready to eat, about 10 minutes.\nWhile you are waiting on the grits, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the green and red peppers with the onion and garlic. When the grits are almost done, add the shrimp to the saute mixture, and cook for about 5 more minutes, or just until the shrimp is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nServe the cheese grits with a generous helping of the shrimp saute over them. Add a dash of hot pepper sauce for heat if you like.",
