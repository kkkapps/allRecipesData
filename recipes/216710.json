    "des": "\"As a native Wisconsinite, I love cheese curds.  I also love potato salad.  Cheese curds are one of those food items that you won't find in all grocery stores nationwide, but you could substitute with chunks of cheddar cheese. \"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Let the potatoes cool enough to handle, and peel; allow the potatoes to cool thoroughly. Cut into bite-size pieces.\nIn a bowl, combine the potatoes, onion, cheese curds, mayonnaise, yellow mustard, and seasoned salt; mix thoroughly. Top the potato salad with hard-boiled egg slices and sprinkle with black pepper. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.",
