    "ins": "In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut in butter or margarine until crumbly.  Make a well in the center.  Beat egg until light and frothy, and mix in milk; pour all at once into well.  Stir lightly to form a soft dough.  Add more milk if needed.\nTurn dough out onto a floured surface, and knead 8 to 10 times.  Pat or roll out to 3/4 inch thickness.  Using a round cookie cutter, push straight down to cut.  Arrange well apart on a greased baking sheet.  Make a deep hollow in the center of each biscuit.  Drop a small spoonful of jam into each hollow.\nBake in a preheated 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) oven for 12 to 15 minutes.  Serve hot.",
