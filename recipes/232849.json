    "ins": "Place bacon into a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until bacon begins to soften and give off its fat, about 2 minutes. Add potatoes and season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir potatoes and bacon until bacon browns and potatoes begin to soften, about 5 minutes.\nCover skillet and cook for 5 minutes; stir. Repeat steps, covering and cooking for 5 minutes and stirring until potatoes are tender and a tip of a knife inserts easily, 15 to 20 more minutes.\nAdjust salt and black pepper to taste; sprinkle chopped rosemary over potatoes, stir, and remove from heat. Drizzle rice vinegar over potatoes and stir to dissolve any browned bits of food stuck to the bottom of the skillet.\nTransfer potatoes to a serving dish and top with a rosemary sprig.",
