    "des": "\"This is a recipe that I made up for a bunch of hungry guys that where watching football one afternoon with my husband. They loved them so much that they actually paid more attention to the wings than the game for 15 minutes! For milder sauce use mild chili sauce instead of Thai. Serve with celery and ranch or blue cheese dressing.\"",

Add chicken wings, coat with the marinade, squeeze to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 4 hours to overnight.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRemove chicken wings from the marinade and shake to remove excess moisture.
