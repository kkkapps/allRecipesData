    "des": "\"I took my grandmother's recipe for chocolate coconut macaroons and made them festive by adding half of a maraschino cherry to the top of each one. Her recipe called for 12 ounces of semisweet melted chocolate, but I used Hershey's\u00c2\u00ae unsweetened cocoa powder instead because it's what I had on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line baking sheets with waxed paper.\nBeat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.\nBeat cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and salt into egg white mixture until incorporated; fold in coconut. Drop spoonfuls of coconut mixture onto the prepared baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until coconut starts to brown, about 20 minutes.\nPress a cherry half into the top of each macaroon; transfer cookies to a cooling rack.",
