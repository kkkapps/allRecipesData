One great thing about this recipe is that it can work around almost any schedule during busy holiday cooking.\n Make the bread crumbs anytime the week before. Broth and bread mixture can sit up to 4 hours and then throw it in the oven with any other dish you are baking. I have tossed it in ovens ranging between 300 degrees F (149 degrees C) to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). Just adjust the time accordingly.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nSpread bread cubes onto 2 baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until completely dry, about 2 hours. Transfer bread cubes to a large bowl.\nMelt 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; saute onions, apples, and celery, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Add chicken broth and poultry seasoning and simmer until flavors blend, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture over bread cubes and toss to coat; season with salt and pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for liquid to absorb, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove cover from bowl and transfer bread cube mixture to a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Drizzle 1/2 cup melted butter over bread cube mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
