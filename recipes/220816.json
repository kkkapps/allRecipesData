    "des": "\"I wanted REAL strawberry frosting for my Real Strawberry Cupcakes and could not find an acceptable recipe. I wanted an intense strawberry taste without using an extract or gelatin. I came up with this recipe using a strawberry puree reduction that is truly the strawberry-est. If you love strawberries, you'll LOVE THIS!!!\"",
    "ins": "Place strawberries in a blender; puree until smooth.\nTransfer strawberry puree to a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, stirring often, until puree is reduced by at least half, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely.\nBeat butter with an electric mixer in a bowl until light and fluffy.\nBeat 1 cup confectioners' sugar into butter until just blended.\nBeat 2 tablespoons strawberry puree and vanilla extract into butter mixture until just blended.\nRepeat with 1 cup confectioners' sugar, followed by 2 tablespoons strawberry puree two more times.\nBeat last 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar into mixture until just blended.",
