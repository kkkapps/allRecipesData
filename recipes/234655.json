    "des": "\"My husband kept talking about 'Freezer Slaw' that his mom made and I couldn't find a recipe for it and she couldn't find hers. Luckily, his aunt still had it! This is a great make-ahead slaw that stays crisp! I shred the cabbage and other vegetables in the food processor.\"",
    "ins": "Combine cabbage, green bell pepper, onion, and carrots in a large bowl. Mix boiling water and salt together in a bowl and pour over cabbage mixture. Set aside for salt to draw out extra water from vegetables, about 1 hour. Drain well.\nMix sugar, 1 cup water, cider vinegar, and celery seed in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat and cool completely.\nPour cooled sugar-vinegar mixture over drained cabbage mixture in a large bowl and toss until slaw is well mixed. Spoon slaw into resealable plastic bags and freeze.",
