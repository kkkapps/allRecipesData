    "des": "\"A sliced cookie that has a nice chocolate, cinnamon and coffee taste.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, stir together flour, cinnamon, and salt.\nIn a large bowl, cream together 1/2 cup shortening, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in coffee mixture, melted chocolate, and egg. Stir in the flour mixture. Cover, and chill for 1 hour, or until dough is no longer sticky. Shape dough into two rolls, 7 inches long. Wrap, and chill for at least 6 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut rolls into 1/4 inch thick slices. Place on ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.\nIn a small heavy saucepan over low heat, melt semisweet chocolate chips and 3 tablespoons shortening, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat. Dip half of each cookie into chocolate mixture. Place on waxed paper until the chocolate is set.",
