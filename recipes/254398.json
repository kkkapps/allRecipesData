    "ins": "In zip-top plastic bag, or plastic container with a lid, mix together oil, Adobo, garlic and pepper flakes. Add shrimp, tossing to combine; transfer to refrigerator. Chill shrimp at least 15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes.\nRemove shrimp from marinade; reserve any remaining liquid. Alternately thread peppers, shrimp and lemons on skewers, so that each skewer starts and ends with peppers and contains 4 shrimp pieces. Using pastry brush, brush reserved marinade onto shrimp and vegetables.\nPrepare grill to medium-high heat, or heat a heavy-bottomed grill pan over medium-high heat. Place shrimp on hot surface and cook until shrimp turn pink and opaque, flipping once, 3 - 5 minutes.",
