    "ins": "In a large stock pot boil potatoes in water and add salt. Cook potatoes until tender and soft and then add carrots, celery, chopped onions, vegetable of your choice, oil and beef bouillon.  Mix together and cook until all vegetables are soft.\nAdd cream of celery soup and season with parsley, onion powder and pepper.  If you desire a thinner type of soup you may want to add 1/2 cup of water.\nHeat soup through, stirring occasionally, and serve.",
