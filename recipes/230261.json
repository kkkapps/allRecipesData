    "des": "\"This is a different type of brisket recipe with an Eastern European Jewish influence. Unlike most briskets that are cooked in the oven, this brisket is simmered on the stove. Best prepared a day or so in advance. Freezes and reheats well.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown brisket on both sides and transfer it to a deep pot.\nStir in tomato paste, water, onions, carrots, mushrooms, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.\nReduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until meat is tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Transfer to a baking dish, cool, and refrigerate overnight.\nAbout 1 1/2 hours before serving, preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Skim off fat residue from sauce and slice brisket across the grain. Layer beef, vegetables, and sauce in a baking dish.\nCover pan with foil and bake in preheated oven until hot, about 1 hour.",
