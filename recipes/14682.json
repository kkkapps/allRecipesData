Add beef and saute, stirring constantly with a fork to crumble as finely as possible.\nWhen meat is browned, add the tomato juice, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, browning sauce and cayenne pepper. Stir together and let simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the liquids have evaporated (about 15 to 20 minutes). Spoon mixture onto hamburger buns and serve.",
