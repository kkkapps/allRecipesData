    "des": "\"In this healthy mashed potato recipe, we flavor the mashed potatoes with tangy buttermilk and fresh snipped chives instead of butter.\"",
    "ins": "Peel potatoes, if desired, and cut into 2-inch chunks. Place the potatoes and salt in a large heavy saucepan. Add cold water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and cook until potatoes are very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well.\nTransfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher, an electric hand-held mixer or by working through a ricer.\nStir buttermilk, chives, and pepper into the potatoes.",
