    "ins": "Combine figs, vinegar, brown sugar, onion, ginger, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cloves, and cinnamon in a saucepan; simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until fig spread is reduced, about 30 minutes. Transfer fig spread to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nArrange bread slices on a baking sheet. Lightly spray both sides of each bread slice with olive oil cooking spray.\nBake bread slices under the broiler until toasted, about 2 minutes per side. Remove bread from oven and cool slightly, keeping broiler on.\nBlend fig spread in a blender or food processor until pureed. Spread about 1 teaspoon fig spread onto each toasted bread slice; top with Brie cheese and apple pieces. Sprinkle each crostini with oregano.\nBroil crostini in the preheated oven until Brie cheese is melted and browned, 1 to 2 minutes.",
