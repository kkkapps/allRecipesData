    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake pie crusts following package directions, but cutting the bake time in half.\nIn a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef until evenly brown; drain excess fat.\nPlace half the refried beans in each pie shell, smearing over the bottom and the sides of the partially baked shells. Spread a layer of ground meat over the beans, and top with the onion, crushed tortilla chips, and cheese.\nBake 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly. Top with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and black olives.",
