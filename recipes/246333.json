    "des": "\"The technique remains the same: tweak this basic technique and add your own twist; barbeque, Asian, etc. The meat turns out juicy, tender and delicious. Use in tacos or other applications.\"",
    "ins": "Trim excess fat from pork; divide meat into 4 equal portions. Season each portion with salt.\nHeat canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork, working in batches, until brown crust forms, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and coat evenly with taco seasoning.\nPour broth into a pressure cooker with rack insert; place pork on rack. Place lid on pressure cooker and lock; bring to low pressure over medium-low heat until pork is tender and shreds easily, about 45 minutes. Let pressure come down naturally, about 15 minutes. Shred pork using 2 forks.",
