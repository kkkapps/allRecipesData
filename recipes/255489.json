    "des": "\"I needed a way to jazz up some spaghetti squash when I was running out of marinara sauce and just started pulling stuff out of the fridge. It came out great. The amounts are approximate and you can adjust to suit your own style/taste. Garlic and olives would probably be great in this too, even capers. What the heck, throw it all in.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place squash face down in a baking pan; pour in water to 1/2 inch.\nBake in the preheated oven until interior can be easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes.\nScrape squash flesh into spaghetti strands with a spoon; place into a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.\nSpread squash, tomatoes, onion, feta cheese, spinach, and spaghetti sauce in 3 even layers in a casserole dish. Top with Parmesan cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until Parmesan cheese is melted and bubbly, 30 minutes to 1 hour.",
