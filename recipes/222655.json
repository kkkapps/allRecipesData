    "des": "\"The turkey turned out moist and yummy! The herb mixture seasons the meat and helps make the gravy, and adding chicken broth and white wine to the bottom of the pan makes great basting juices.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).\nPlace turkey breast in a shallow baking pan; coat outside of turkey with nonstick cooking spray. Tuck onion and celery in breast cavity; place butter between meat and skin. Pour chicken broth and white wine into bottom of pan.\nCombine lemon pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, sage, and paprika in a small bowl; rub seasoning mix over turkey.\nBake in preheated oven until a meat thermometer reads 175 degrees F (80 degrees C), basting every 30 minutes, 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Remove turkey and keep warm. Pour pan drippings into a cup and discard grease.\nCombine flour and water in a saucepan until smooth. Pour in pan drippings and chicken bouillon. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly, and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Slice turkey and serve with gravy.",
