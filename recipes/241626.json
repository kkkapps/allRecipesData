    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nArrange chicken in the bottom of a 2-quart casserole dish. Squeeze lime juice over the chicken and season with salt and pepper.\nMix salsa and garlic together in a bowl. Spoon 1/4 cup of the salsa mixture over each chicken breast; top with more lime juice.\nCook chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 50 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
