    "des": "\"Simple tasty baked fish recipe with that Cajun kick. Good for any flaky white fish fillets but catfish is the classic.  Be careful how you mix the Dijon and the hot sauce, one overpowers the other or the two overpower the fish. I like to sprinkle some strong paprika (i.e. cayenne) at presentation for effect. Garnish with lemon wedges.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nArrange the catfish in a shallow baking dish; season liberally with salt and pepper.\nSpread onion slices over the fish.\nDot fish with butter.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.\nRemove baking dish from oven.\nPreheat the oven's broiler.\nMix the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and hot chile oil together in a bowl.\nSpread the mayonnaise mixture over the fish.\nReturn the fish to the oven and broil until the sauce is browned and bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes.\nGarnish with chopped cilantro.",
