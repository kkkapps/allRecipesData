Place melted butter in a 9 x 13-inch baking pan.\nCombine grated cheese, panko crumbs, and Italian seasoning in a shallow dish.\nPat chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Roll each chicken breast in the melted butter, then roll in the Parmesan crumb mixture, return the coated chicken to the baking pan, leaving a little space between each chicken breast.\nSprinkle remaining Parmesan crumb mixture over the top of the chicken and spoon any remaining melted butter over the top of the Parmesan crumbs.\nBake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
