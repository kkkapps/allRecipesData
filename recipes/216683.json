    "des": "\"This chili earned its blue ribbon at a chili cook-off three years in a row! It is a mild, sweet chili, but it could always be spiced up with a little hot sauce. In Wisconsin, chili has macaroni noodles in it, which my husband thinks is the best part of this recipe. Enjoy! Add canned kidney beans with the macaroni, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Place ground beef into a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook the beef until it begins to lose its pink color, about 8 minutes, breaking the meat up into crumbles as it cooks; stir in celery, red bell pepper, and onion. Continue to cook until the beef is browned, about 8 more minutes. Drain excess fat.\nStir in diced tomatoes, tomato juice, water, chili powder, brown sugar, and beef bouillon cubes; cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in the macaroni, and continue simmering until the pasta is tender, 10 to 15 more minutes.",
