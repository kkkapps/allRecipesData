    "des": "\"Just love this soup. I developed it to use up small quantities of veggies, and we fell in love with the flavors. For a less spicy soup, use regular italian sausage. For more heat, add some cayenne pepper and/or crushed red pepper flakes.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a stock pot over medium heat. Crumble sausage into the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPour chicken broth into the pot; add tomatoes, coleslaw mix, celery, potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir cream into individual servings.",
