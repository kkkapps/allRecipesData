    "des": "\"My husband lived in Italy for 3 years, so he's really picky about his Italian cuisine! I needed a great meal that was super-quick one night for his dinner; I had spicy battered shrimp on hand that I wanted to use and a couple choices of dried pasta. This sauce sounded perfect to tie it all together! \n\nServed over tortiglioni pasta with salad and toasted Italian bread. Just like I spent all day on dinner. It is really hard to mess-up this kind of white sauce. In my opinion, it was very much like an Alfredo sauce! Of course there is very little difference in the two sauces.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter and margarine in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in flour and bouillon until roux is well blended. Continue to cook and stir until thickened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and whisk water into roux until smooth. Stir in milk; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes more. Season with white pepper.",
