    "des": "\"Tired of everything being spicy and looking for a quick, nice dinner with a subtle flavor? Try this! Chicken breasts are laid on a bed of broccoli, and blanketed with a mushroom sauce with a hint of horseradish. Great with garlic bread!  Of course - if subtle isn't what you're looking for - you can spice this up all you want!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nSpread the broccoli evenly in the bottom of the baking dish. Place chicken breasts over the broccoli. In a medium bowl, stir together the condensed soup, sour cream and horseradish. Pour or spread evenly over the chicken and broccoli.\nBake uncovered for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Let stand for a few minutes before serving for the sauce to thicken.",
