    "des": "\"A savory Mexican dish that can easily be turned into vegetarian by replacing the chicken bouillon for vegetable bullion . The cream tones down the heat of the poblano peppers. You won't have enough! Serve with warm corn tortillas.\"",
    "ins": "Blend the crema, cream cheese, and chicken bouillon in a blender until smooth; set aside.\nPlace the peppers on a large griddle over medium-high heat. Roast until the skin blisters and turns black. Remove peppers from griddle and place in a plastic bag, allowing them to sweat for 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Peel and discard the outer skin of the peppers; halve length-wise and remove the seeds and veins. Slice into thick strips. Set aside.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the corn into the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and cook another 5 minutes. Add the poblano strips to the saucepan. Pour the cream mixture over the vegetables and bring to a simmer; cook at a simmer until hot, about 5 minutes more.",
