    "des": "\"I read that when baking you can replace half or all of the butter with mashed avocado to make it a little healthier. I got out my favorite cookie recipe from my dad and tried it. I replaced half the butter. They were still very yummy and I couldn't tell there was avocado in them.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray baking sheets with cooking spray.\nCombine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat white sugar, brown sugar, butter, avocado, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; beat in egg until smooth. Stir flour mixture, a few tablespoons at a time, into creamed mixture until dough is just mixed; stir in chocolate chips. Drop dough by the spoonful onto the baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
