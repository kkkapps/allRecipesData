    "des": "\"This is an alteration on a typical stuffed cabbage recipe. It's healthy, low-fat, low-carb, and a bit spicy. You can't go wrong with this recipe! You may omit the red pepper and cayenne if you do not like spicy foods, or increase like we do! We serve this over brown rice to make it more of a whole meal. We love it! I used roasted garlic-flavored tomato sauce for extra 'kick.'\"",
