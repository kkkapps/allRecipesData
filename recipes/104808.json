Add the cashews and toast until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.\nHeat the remaining oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the chile peppers, mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Once the seeds start to pop, add the curry leaves and half of the nuts. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.\nWhen the rice is done, transfer it to a serving bowl and stir in the turmeric, lime juice and tamarind paste, then mix in the chilies and spices along with the oil from the skillet.
