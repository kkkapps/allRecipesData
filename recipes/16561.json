    "des": "\"Just chicken, rice, creamy soup, Cheddar cheese and soft bread cubes, mixed together and baked. This is a quick and easy dish that even the kids like! Note: If you are in a big hurry, use cooked chicken and minute rice.  Can be made ahead of time and refrigerated - just add the bread topping the night before cooking.\"",
