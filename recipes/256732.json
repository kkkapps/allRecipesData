    "des": "\"I had planned to go on a 3-day juice detox but my juicer died the morning I was due to start so I was stuck with a whole load of fruit and veg. I threw together this salad using the ingredients that were to go into one of the juices. It turned out surprisingly yummy and looked gorgeous. This is definitely a salad for those who like their food on the tart side but the sweetness of the red apple balances it out nicely.\"",
