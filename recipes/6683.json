    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, salt, oil, sugar, and 4 cups flour.  Mix thoroughly, and let sponge rise until doubled in size.\nGradually add about 4 cups flour, kneading until smooth.  Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn several times to coat.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rise until doubled.\nPunch down the dough, let it rest a few minutes.  Divide dough into three equal parts.  Shape into loaves, and place in three 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch greased bread pans.  Let rise until almost doubled.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes. The loaves may need to be covered for the last few minutes with foil to prevent excess browning.",
