    "des": "\"This cake recipe is the result of a discontinued, but wonderful box mix. It is a chocolate cake that slices to reveal a beautiful white coconut center. Yummy! The vanilla glaze can easily be made into chocolate by adding 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.\nIn a large bowl, blend together the shortening, 1 3/4 cups white sugar, egg yolk and vanilla until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time using an electric mixer. Combine 2 cups flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; stir into the egg mixture alternately with the sour cream and water. Pour batter into the prepared Bundt pan.\nIn a separate bowl with clean beaters, whip the egg white until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in 1/4 cup white sugar while continuing to whip to firm peaks. Fold in the coconut, 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 teaspoon of vanilla by hand using a spatula or wooden spoon. Drop this mixture by teaspoonfuls over the chocolate batter in the pan. Be careful not to let the filling touch the sides of the pan.\nBake for 55 to 65 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes in the pan, then invert onto a wire rack to allow the cake to cool completely. Remove cake from pan, and drizzle with vanilla glaze.\nTo make vanilla glaze, mix together the confectioners' sugar, butter and milk in a small bowl, gradually adding milk until the mixture is thick but pourable.  Drizzle over cooled cake.",
