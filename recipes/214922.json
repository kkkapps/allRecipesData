    "des": "\"This recipe may be simple but its flavor is big and juicy. I think it would be fabulous alongside spicy Asian curries, quick stir-fries, herb-roasted dinners -- and yes, it would be perfect for picnics. This is a delicious make-ahead picnic salad. Make more than you think you'll need, because you just might want some for breakfast.\"",
    "ins": "Place the cucumber chunks and slices in a large bowl with the tomato and onion. Whisk together the champagne vinegar, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, agave nectar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until frothy. Pour dressing over the vegetables. Gently toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.",
