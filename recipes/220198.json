    "des": "\"Delicious crispy asparagus grilled on an open flame releases the flavor and makes kids love their veggies! You can add or reduce cook time to your liking. Less time will make the asparagus snap more easily, but cooking longer will make them extra crispy and delicious for dipping. Use 1/2 cup melted butter for dipping.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill on medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nToss asparagus and olive oil in a bowl until evenly coated.\nSprinkle Parmesan cheese and salt onto asparagus until evenly distributed.\nPlace asparagus spears on grill crosswise. Cook until tips are almost blackened, 20 minutes; turning spears over after 10 minutes.",
