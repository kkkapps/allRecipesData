    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nFill a large saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the pork and boil for 7 to 10 minutes. While this is cooking, place the rice cereal squares, seasoned salt, garlic powder and onion powder in a resealable plastic bag and crush the cereal to crumbs; set aside.\nPlace the pork, mushroom soup, green beans, mayonnaise, pasta and 1 cup of the cheese into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix this well, then cover with the remaining cheese. Top off with the crushed cereal mixture, covering everything completely.\nBake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until heated throughout.",
