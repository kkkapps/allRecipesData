    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nPlace squash in a bowl; drizzle with olive oil. Stir to coat. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl; dredge squash in bread crumbs until well coated.\nCook squash on preheated grill until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.\nWhisk mayonnaise, yogurt, taco sauce, chile paste, and paprika together in a bowl. Top each cooked squash slice with a dollop of mayonnaise mixture.",
