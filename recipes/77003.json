    "des": "\"Love tiramisu but don't have time to make it? My ice cream version rivals the real thing and can be prepared in under half an hour, no pastry skills required - not a bad return on a dessert that serves up to 14 people. If you think your supermarket doesn't carry mascarpone cheese, look again. Just because you've never seen it doesn't mean it's not there. If you really can't find it, no worries. You can make the sauce with cream cheese; just follow the conversion method in the introduction to the recipe. If you have little espresso cups collecting dust in the china cabinet, bring them out.

    "ins": "Mix coffee and rum. Line a 2-quart metal loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving an overhang. Use a pastry brush to paint the spiked coffee onto the ladyfingers. Then line the bottom and sides of the pan with ladyfingers, rounded side out.\nReserving 1/2 cup of chocolate for garnish, stir rest of chocolate into ice cream. Turn ice cream into loaf pan, using a rubber spatula to press ice cream evenly into pan. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 2 hours or up to 5 days.\nWhen ready to serve, mix cheese, liqueur and sugar until smooth; whisk in half-and-half to form a thick but pourable sauce. Unmold dessert, using ends of plastic wrap to remove it from pan; peel away wrap. Slice loaf, drizzle with sauce and sprinkle with chocolate.",
