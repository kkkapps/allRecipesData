    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCook bacon in a large oven-proof skillet until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Crumble bacon into a bowl; reserve drippings in skillet. Mix fontina cheese into bacon until combined.\nLay chicken breasts on a flat surface; place 1/4 cup of bacon-cheese mixture on top of each. Roll up tightly and secure with toothpicks; sprinkle with black pepper. Arrange rolls in the skillet containing reserved bacon drippings.\nBrown chicken over medium heat until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the skillet and transfer to the oven.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
