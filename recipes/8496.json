Dinner will be hot and ready whenever you have a chance to eat.  Meat falls from the bones, and sauce can be used as a gravy for rice or potatoes.  Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Put chicken, legs up, into slow cooker.  Pour sauce over and inside the chicken.  Cover.\nCook for 8 to 10 hours on low setting.  It is not a good idea to check it, as steam escapes and it takes quite awhile to reheat.",
