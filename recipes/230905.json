    "des": "\"These marinated tuna steaks, served rare, taste 'fancy' but are very easy to cook. Even my husband, who doesn't like most cooked fish, enjoys these steaks. A sprinkling of cracked black pepper is a good finisher for this dish.\"",
    "ins": "Mix soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, sesame oil, molasses, cayenne pepper, ginger, and garlic together in a bowl.\nPlace tuna steaks in a large resealable bag or airtight container; pour marinade over steaks. Marinate steaks at room temperature for 20 minutes.\nHeat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Remove steaks from marinade and arrange in the hot pan; gently shake pan to avoid sticking. Cook approximately 1 1/2 minutes and flip. Cook other side until tuna is desired doneness, 1 to 2 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).",
