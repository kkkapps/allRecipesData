Remove from heat and allow to cool.\nPlace the chicken wings in a large bowl. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the wings and toss to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Allow chicken to marinate in refrigerator overnight or 8 hours.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour the chicken wings and marinade into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until thoroughly hot, about 45 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil from the baking dish and continue baking uncovered another 15 minutes. Serve hot.",
