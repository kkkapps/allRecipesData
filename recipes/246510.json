    "des": "\"Fresh chive blossoms steeped in Champagne vinegar makes a subtly chive-flavored, blush-colored vinegar. Try it in your next vinaigrette salad dressing, and make several batches of this gorgeous vinegar to give away all summer. After 2 weeks, the vinegar will take on the delicate purple color and subtle onion flavor of the chives.\"",
    "ins": "Wash chive blossoms by holding them upside down from the stem and plunging them into a deep bowl of cold water. Swish them around to dislodge any soil. Pour out the water and repeat 2 or 3 times.\nSnip or pinch off each blossom where it meets the stem. Dry blossoms gently but thoroughly with paper towels or in a salad spinner. Pack canning jar with blossoms loosely.\nHeat vinegar in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until hot but not boiling, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour hot vinegar over blossoms in canning jar, screw on lid, and store in the refrigerator until desired flavor intensity is reached, 1 to 2 weeks. Strain out blossoms and store vinegar in a sterilized glass container.",
