    "des": "\"My son always wanted this pie for his 'birthday cake'. This pie was originally an unbaked pie but with raw eggs being iffy nowadays we now bake it.  You can also use prepared graham cracker crusts or  baked and cooled pastry shells instead of the vanilla wafer crusts, if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, beat the eggs well.\nIn another bowl, mix together milk and lemon juice, and add to the eggs.  Stir in pie cherries.  Divide filling into crusts.\nPlace pies in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and chill for at least 2 hours.",
