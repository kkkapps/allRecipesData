    "des": "\"Spicy white fish wrapped in cabbage with a tasty wasabi-mayonnaise sauce. A delicious and easy way to enjoy fish tacos on a low-carb diet! You can also add a quick fresh pico de gallo to this if your diet allows tomatoes. Delicious! I now enjoy this more than regular fish tacos. Try this also with halibut or tilapia.\"",
    "ins": "Pat fish dry with paper towels.\nHeat canola oil with dried red chiles in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook fish in the hot oil until flesh is opaque and the edges of the fish are slightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Sprinkle fish with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat, drain, and discard peppers.\nStir mayonnaise, wasabi paste, and 2 tablespoons cilantro together in a bowl. Spoon several tablespoons of fish into a cabbage leaf and wrap leaf around fish; repeat with remaining leaves and fish. Garnish each roll with a sprinkling of cilantro. Serve with wasabi mayonnaise.",
