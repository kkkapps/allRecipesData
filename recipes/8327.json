    "des": "\"We always called it the \"Busy Cake\"...too many things going on with it! Crushed maraschino cherries can be found in the ice cream sundae department at the grocery store. If you can't find them, get regular maraschino cherries and chop.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat  oven  to  350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.\nIn a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, soda and salt.\nAdd eggs, coffee, milk, oil and vanilla. Beat until smooth (batter will be thin).\nFold in cherries and chocolate chips. Pour batter into 9x13 inch pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted into middle comes out clean. It's best to leave it in the pan, because the chips and the cherries sort of sink to the bottom and solidify and will stick big time! Frost with white buttercream.\nFor the frosting: In a large bowl, combine butter, confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and vanilla. Cream with an electric mixer. Add milk by the tablespoon until frosting is smooth.",
