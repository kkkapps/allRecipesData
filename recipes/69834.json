    "des": "\"This is a cake recipe by my beloved Great Grandmother!  She was a master in her time.  She grew up during the depression and made up lots of recipes cooking for her large family.  This cake is wonderful!  I serve it with frosting or whip cream and berries.  Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 or 9  inch round cake pans.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the batter alternately with the milk. Stir in vanilla. Distribute batter evenly between the prepared pans.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cake springs back when pressed gently in the center. Cool in pans over a wire rack. When completely cooled, frost or fill as desired.",
