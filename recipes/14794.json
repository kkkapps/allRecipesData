    "ins": "To Marinate: In a large resealable plastic bag combine the fruit nectar, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger root, ground ginger and brown sugar. Mix together until sugar dissolves. Add pork, seal bag and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or, if possible, overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove bag from refrigerator. Remove meat from marinade, wipe dry with paper towels and brown in a large skillet. Place browned pork on a rack in a roasting pan and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour (tenderloins 35 to 40 minutes) or until internal temperature of meat has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Baste with marinade every 10 minutes while baking. (Note: If there is any leftover marinade, you can boil it and add cornstarch for a nice sauce.)",
