    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla. Stir in baking soda, baking powder and salt; gradually mix in flour to form a dough that is stiff enough to roll out. More or less flour may be necessary.\nRoll out dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into shapes using cookie cutters. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and the center appears dry. Cookies will stay white, so be careful not to overbake.",
