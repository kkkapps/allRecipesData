    "des": "\"A rich custard-like filling. The combined flavor of apples and cream cheese is mouthwatering. Strawberry jelly may be used in place of apricot preserves.\"",
    "ins": "Place sliced apples in a large bowl and toss with sugar and lemon juice. Melt butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Add apples to skillet and saute until tender. Allow to cool.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in 1 cup milk, pudding mix, and lemon rind. Add remaining 1/2 cup milk, and beat until smooth. Spread mixture into pastry shell. Arrange apples over cream cheese layer.\nIn a small saucepan, heat preserves until runny. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat apples. Refrigerate pie for at least 1 hour before serving.",
