Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.\nBring the grits, water, and salt to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the grits are tender, about 30 minutes. Add to the sausage mixture in the casserole dish and stir; press into an even layer. Pour the soup over the mixture in an even layer. Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese over the soup.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, about 30 minutes.",
