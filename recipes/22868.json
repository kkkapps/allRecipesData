    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and butterscotch chips. Stir frequently until smooth then stir one cup of the sugar, remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Set aside. Grease a 9x13 inch pan.\nIn a medium bowl, whip eggs with remaining 1 cup of sugar until thick and pale, about 3 minutes. Slowly add the butterscotch mixture to the eggs while mixing. Combine the flour and salt; fold into the batter until absorbed. Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until firm. Allow to cool completely before cutting into squares.",
