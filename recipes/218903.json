    "ins": "Mix the strawberries in a bowl with confectioners' sugar and lemon juice; allow to stand about 15 minutes to form juice. Stir several times.\nPlace a slice of pound cake onto a dessert plate, and spoon about 1/3 cup of strawberries and juice over the cake. Place a dollop of whipped topping on the berries, and top with another cake slice. Spoon another tablespoon or so of strawberries over the top to serve.",
