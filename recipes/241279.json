    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.\nBeat eggs in a bowl using a fork. Add milk, garlic salt, and black pepper to eggs and beat until fully integrated.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and drain grease from skillet. Chop bacon.\nSaute red bell pepper and onion in the same skillet over medium-high heat until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.\nSpread spinach into the bottom of the prepared baking pan; top with bacon and red bell pepper mixture. Pour egg mixture over bacon mixture and sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese and Asiago cheese over egg mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.",
