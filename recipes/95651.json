    "des": "\"A terrific alternative to tired mashed potatoes for holiday meals. This dish must be started two days before serving but on the day of your meal, all you have to do is pop it in the oven.  I don't know who Ricci is but this came through my family in Syracuse.\"",
    "ins": "Two days before serving, boil potatoes whole, with skins, until tender, about 25 minutes. When you can insert a fork and remove it easily, they are done. Drain, and refrigerate.\nThe day before serving, peel and grate the potatoes. I like to use a food processor with grating attachment. Place the potatoes into a large bowl and toss gently with melted butter, half-and-half, onion, salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate.\nThe day of the meal, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 1 hour, uncovered. You may broil for a minute at the end to brown the top if you like.",
