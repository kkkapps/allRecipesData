    "des": "\"A wonderful shrimp soup flavored with feta cheese, clam juice, white wine & tomatoes. Even the pickiest eaters in my family love it! Pinot Grigio is suggested for the wine.\"",

Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes.\nTransfer soup in batches to a blender, and puree until smooth. Return to the pot, and stir in feta cheese. Continue cooking 10 minutes.\nStir the shrimp into the soup, and continue cooking 3 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque. Mix in parsley just before serving.",
