    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the cream of chicken soup, milk, and Italian seasoning until well combined, then mix in the new potatoes, turkey meat, mixed vegetables, and 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese. Gently stir the cut-up biscuits into the mixture until coated, and spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top of the casserole is deep golden brown and the biscuits are no longer doughy inside, 35 to 40 minutes. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese on top, and return to oven; bake until cheese topping is melted, an additional 4 to 6 minutes.",
