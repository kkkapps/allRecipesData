    "des": "\"Cheap and easy alternative to take out. Our kid loves ramen noodles, so this is a great way to make him eat his veggies without him even realizing it! You could make this with chicken, beef, or pork as well, just use the corresponding ramen soup flavor. I'm sure that a lot of people would also add sesame oil for more authentic flavor, but I find sesame oil overpowering (personal preference).\"",
    "ins": "Combine shrimp, mixed vegetables, and water in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until vegetables are cooked through and shrimp are hot, about 5 minutes.\nBring a small pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in the boiling water until soft, 2 to 3 minutes; drain. Add noodles to vegetable mixture. Stir seasoning from ramen noodles, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger into the vegetable and noodle mixture; toss to combine. Cook and stir until hot, about 1 minute.",
