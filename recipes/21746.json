Form log of sausage mixture lengthwise down center of each rectangle. Fold over the long sides of pastry to cover sausage log. Place on ungreased cookie sheet, seam down. Brush with egg white and sprinkle with poppy seeds.\nBake 20 minutes until crust is golden. When completely cooled, slice into one and one-half inch slices.",
