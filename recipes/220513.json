    "des": "\"Warm and delicious corned beef dip. Serve with crackers or toast the hunks of bread taken from the center of the Italian loaf. You can also bypass the bread altogether and bake in a 9x13 covered pan.  I have also cooked this in a slow cooker on Low for 3 hours.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.\nTransfer onion to a large mixing bowl.\nStir corned beef, cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, Swiss cheese, and garlic powder into onion. Mix until thoroughly combined.\nSlice a piece of bread from the top of the Italian bread and hollow the center of the loaf, creating a long bread bowl. Leave at least 1/2 inch of bread on the sides. Reserve bread chunks from center of loaf for dipping if desired.\nSpoon the corned beef mixture into the bread bowl.\nWrap the filled bread bowl in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until the dip is fully cooked and bubbling, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
