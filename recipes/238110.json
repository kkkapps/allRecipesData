    "des": "\"This chili was made for school chili suppers back in the 1950's. I remember in the third and fourth grades, the teachers would have each student draw on poster board a bowl of chili and crackers. The posters were then used to advertise the coming event. This recipe comes from our neighbor who worked in the school cafeteria.\"",
