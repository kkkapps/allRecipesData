    "des": "\"This BBQ sauce is a recipe a friend's mother gave me when I told her I was making pulled pork sandwiches. I intended to use bottled sauce since it was my first time preparing pulled pork. My pulled pork turned out ABSOLUTELY amazing because of this recipe. I'll admit I added a few dabs of bottled sauce because I wasn't confident the consistency of this sauce would be ok. Regardless, this is good stuff!\"",
    "ins": "Place the apple cider, balsamic vinegar, ketchup, honey mustard, yellow mustard, coarse mustard, honey, molasses, cane syrup, beer, coffee, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, hot sauce, black pepper, celery salt, and the habanero pepper in a large pan. Simmer the mixture over low heat until thoroughly blended, about 25 minutes. Remove from the stove, cool, pour into a covered container, and refrigerate until needed.",
