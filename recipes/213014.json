    "des": "\"This recipe is handed down to me by my Italian mother. I grew up with this dessert. It's quick and easy. The chestnut puree may be hard to find. It's actually called 'Torta di Castagne' or Chestnut Cake. It just looks like a salami log. Great for a holiday meal. Great topped with whip cream.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the sugar, cocoa powder, butter, and chestnut puree in a bowl. Fold in the almonds and walnuts until evenly blended. Pat the mixture into a log and wrap tightly with wax paper. Refrigerate overnight before slicing to serve.",
