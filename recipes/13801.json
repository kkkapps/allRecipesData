Grease a 9x13-inch pan.\nPrepare the topping by mixing together the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and chopped pecans.\nSift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\nBeat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, thoroughly beating each egg into the butter mixture before adding the next. Add apple butter, vanilla, and wheat germ or bran cereal. Add sifted dry ingredients alternately with sour cream; mix well after each addition.\nPour half the batter into the prepared pan; sprinkle with half of the topping. Pour remaining batter into pan and top with the rest of the topping.\nBake in the preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.",
