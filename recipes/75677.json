    "des": "\"Peaches and custard baked to a chewy, gooey perfection on a tender cookie crust. Can be made all year with canned peaches.  Delicious hot with ice cream or alone cold.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSift the flour, baking powder, salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar into a large bowl. Cut in butter by pinching between your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place the peach halves cut side up on top of the crust in a nice pattern. Mix together the remaining sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the peach halves.\nBake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. While the peaches are baking, whisk together the egg yolks and cream in a medium bowl. Pour over the peaches after the 15 minutes are up.\nReduce the oven's temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Return the dish to the oven, and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.",
