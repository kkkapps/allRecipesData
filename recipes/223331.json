    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add peaches. Cook until peach skin begins to split, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly. Peel, pit, and quarter peaches and transfer to a large pot. Mash peaches with a potato masher and stir in sugar, cinnamon, and cloves.\nCook and stir on low heat until desired consistency, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack peach preserves into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).",
