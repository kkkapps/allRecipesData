    "ins": "Pour the grapefruit juice, blueberries, sugar, and vodka into a blender, and blend until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.\nPour the mixture into a container, and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours. Thoroughly stir the sorbet to break up the ice crystals to a slushy consistency, and return to freezer until firm, about 3 hours. Store in the freezer in a covered container.",
