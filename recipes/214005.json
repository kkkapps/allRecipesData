    "des": "\"Famous Western Pennsylvania Ham Loaf.  Perfect way to use up left over smoked ham after Christmas or Easter.  Be sure to serve it with a generous amount of sauce. We use a hand-held meat grinder that belonged to my husband's great-grandmother - doesn't take long and is somewhat nostalgic.  \n\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet or jellyroll pan with parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, mix the smoked ham and ground pork together until thoroughly mixed, and lightly mix in the graham crackers, evaporated milk, and eggs. Form the mixture into two loaves, and place the loaves onto the prepared baking sheet.\nIn a saucepan over medium-low heat, whisk together the tomato soup, brown sugar, vinegar, water, and dry mustard until well combined. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the brown sugar. Pour about 1 cup of sauce over each ham loaf, reserving remaining sauce.\nBake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Slice and serve with reserved sauce.",
