    "ins": "Combine flour and sugar into the bowl of an electric mixer.  Cut butter into tablespoon pieces; add it to the flour and butter. Use the paddle beater to cut the butter and flour together.  Alternatively, this can be done by hand with a pastry blender.\nWith the mixer on low speed , or while stirring the mixture with a fork, pour in the cold water.  When the dough starts to clump, and before it turns into a ball, stop stirring.\nLightly knead dough in the bowl until it forms a ball.  Divide dough into two parts.  Flatten each part into a disk, and chill for about 30 minutes before rolling.",
