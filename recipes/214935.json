    "des": "\"As the name implies, roasted bell peppers married to a simple red wine and garlic vinaigrette. Lovely on sandwiches, tossed into a salad, etc.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).\nPlace the bell peppers onto a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until the skins are nicely blackened, about 30 minutes. Turn the peppers once halfway through to ensure even cooking. Once blackened, place the peppers into a bowl, cover with foil, and allow to steam 20 to 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, garlic, and capers in a bowl; set aside.\nOnce the peppers have finished steaming, remove and discard the stems, skins, and seeds. Cut the peppers into quarters and stir into the vinaigrette. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.",
