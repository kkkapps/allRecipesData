    "des": "\"A chocolate chip cookie adaptation EVEN my hubbie enjoys. The idea came from a cookie recipe submitted by Diane Abed.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and brandy. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips and dried fruit mix.  Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 2 inches apart.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, cookies taste best when taken from the oven while still slightly doughy. Cool on cookie sheets for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
