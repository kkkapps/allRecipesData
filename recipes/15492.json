A 'thin' Ganache can be melted to use as a glaze or whipped, and used as a filling for cakes. Use the best quality chocolate you can find.\"",
    "ins": "Chop the chocolate into small pieces and place it in a large stainless steel bowl.\nIn a large, high sided saucepan, heat cream over medium high heat, stirring frequently, until it starts to boil. At this point, the cream will want to boil over, so keep an eye on it! Immediately remove from heat and pour over chopped chocolate.\nStir until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is smooth. Cool completely and then store in refrigerator. Ganache can be reheated in a stainless steel bowl over hot, but not boiling, water.",
