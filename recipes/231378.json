    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix ground turkey, oats, 1/2 chopped onion, pear applesauce, 3 tablespoons chili powder, egg, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; press into an 8-inch square baking dish.\nHeat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir 2 tablespoons onion until softened and lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir brown sugar, barbeque sauce, and 1 teaspoon chili powder into onion; cook over low heat until sauce is warm, about 5 minutes.\nBake meatloaf in the preheated oven, occasionally brushing sauce over the top, until cooked through, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
