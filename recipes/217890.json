    "des": "\"A great change from regular Mexican style tacos.  A cool summer dinner, made quick with leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to shred it for real tacos.\"",
    "ins": "Combine ranch dressing, sour cream, 1 teaspoon taco seasoning, and salsa in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until serving.\nToss chicken with remaining taco seasoning. Cover bowl loosely with wax paper or plastic wrap. Microwave chicken until chicken is heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes.\nWarm the tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them pliable. Place a scoop of chicken on the tortilla and top with lettuce, tomato, green onion, olives, avocado, cheese, and a spoonful of the ranch dressing mixture.",
