    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, and cook until it begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, basil, and sun-dried tomatoes; cook and stir until the garlic has softened, about 2 minutes more. Pour in the water along with the chipotle pepper, bay leaf, bouillon, and vinegar. Add the peas, and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 15 minutes.\nRemove the soup from the heat, and discard the chipotle pepper and bay leaf. Carefully puree the soup until silky smooth in batches in a blender, or use an immersion blender right in the saucepan. Serve the soup with a sprinkle of Gruyere cheese and freshly ground black pepper.",
