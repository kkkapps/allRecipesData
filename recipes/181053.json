Remove from heat.\nStir in brown sugar, white sugar, and honey; mix until sugar is dissolved. Beat in eggs, a little at a time. Add flour, salt, baking powder, vanilla, hazelnuts, cayenne pepper, and orange zest. Stir until blended well and mixture is glossy. Pour batter evenly into pan.\nBake until the surface looks dry and a toothpick inserted in the center has just a film of chocolate on it, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool on a rack about 12 minutes and cut into squares while still warm.",
