    "des": "\"I got this recipe from a good friend. I absolutely love it. \n\nIt is a refreshing and surprisingly healthy salad. You can have it as a side dish, or, for a heartier meal, throw some grilled chicken on it and enjoy! The salad can be eaten right away or kept in the fridge for up to three days. If you make it in advance, toss the salad again before serving to redistribute the juices.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.\nStarting at the leafy top, cut parsley and kale perpendicular to the stems in 1/2- or 1/4-inch cuts until you reach the point where there's nothing left but stems. Discard stems. Chop the pile of greens on your board with a knife or cleaver until the pieces of parsley and kale are no larger than 1/4 inch. It should be pretty fine, but you don't want it to turn into a paste. Transfer parsley and kale to a large mixing bowl. Toss quinoa, grape tomatoes, cucumber, and shallot with the parsley and kale.\nWhisk lemon juice, olive oil, and salt together in a small bowl; drizzle over the salad and toss to coat.",
