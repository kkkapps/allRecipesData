    "des": "\"This has been made by my family for years; not sure where it came from. Great for cookouts or picnics since there is no mayo. Best if made the day before to let flavors blend. Serve with your favorite chicken, pork, or beef as a refreshing side dish. You can substitute red, yellow, or orange peppers for the green to add extra color to this dish.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook seashell pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.\nMix pasta, cucumbers, onion, green bell pepper, and pimento peppers in a large bowl.\nWhisk tomato soup, sugar, vinegar, and oil together in a bowl until smooth; pour over pasta mixture. Stir to coat. Refrigerate 12 to 24 hours before serving, stirring occasionally.",
