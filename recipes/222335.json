    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.\nSpread pizza dough evenly onto a 9x13-inch baking sheet; sprinkle with sausage and mozzarella cheese. Roll the dough around the sausage and mozzarella, using the method similar to rolling a cinnamon roll. Crimp the roll closed; place seam side down on baking sheet. Brush the roll with olive oil.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.",
