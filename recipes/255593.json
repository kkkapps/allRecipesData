    "des": "\"My favorite muffin recipe is a chocolate chip orange zucchini bread recipe found on Allrecipes! But when I had to cut out dairy and gluten, I had to get creative to get the same satisfaction out of a healthier version. These turned out great! Be sure to add the glaze - it really makes the muffin.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.\nMix almond flour, chocolate chips, coconut flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a small bowl.\nBeat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and frothy. Add brown sugar, almond oil, maple syrup, 1 teaspoon orange zest, and vanilla extract; mix well. Stir in zucchini. Fold in almond flour mixture until well blended. Thin batter with almond milk if it appears too thick.\nDivide batter among prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes.\nCombine confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and 1 teaspoon orange zest in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until glaze is smooth.
