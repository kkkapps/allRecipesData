    "ins": "Soak the porcini mushrooms in the water for 30 seconds. Drain, reserving the liquid, and chop.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the nutmeg, walnuts, bay leaf, mushrooms, and mushroom liquid; bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce reduces and darkens, 5 to 10 minutes. Press the snapper fillets into the flour and shake off the excess. Place the fillets into the pan and cover with the sauce.\nPlace the skillet in the preheated oven and bake until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley to serve.",
