    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet. Brown beef cubes for 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce the heat, add the garlic, salt and cumin. Cook another 15 minutes.\nAdd the can of tomatoes and heat to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add water to the skillet as needed to keep the mixture from boiling dry.\nWhen cooked very tender, cool, then shred the meat using 2 forks. Place back on heat and stir until most of the liquid has evaporated.\nIf planning to freeze, cool  before packing in freezer bags and placing in freezer.\nFor soft burritos, top a warm flour tortilla with the meat mixture, salsa, and grated cheese.",
