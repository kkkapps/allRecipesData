Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.\nRemove from heat and stir in peanut butter and marshmallow creme.  Beat vigorously until smooth.  Pour quickly into prepared baking dish.  Let cool completely before cutting into squares.",
