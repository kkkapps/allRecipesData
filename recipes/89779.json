    "des": "\"A different and delicious way to eat up all the zucchini that's overflowing from the garden. Diced zucchini are sauteed with garlic and red pepper flakes then simmered with cream, and served with Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Don't skimp on the olive oil.\"",
    "ins": "Warm olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and garlic to hot oil, and season with salt and red pepper flakes. Cook, turning occasionally, until  zucchini are well browned on all sides, about 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside.\nStir milk into zucchini, and simmer until it is reduced by about half, about 10 minutes. Add pasta to skillet, and stir well. Sprinkle parsley and 1/4 cup Parmesan over the top, and toss. Garnish with remaining Parmesan to serve.",
