    "des": "\"You can't go wrong with meat and potatoes, and this recipe combines them in one dish. The recipe was given to my husband by a friend at work who brought it for lunch often.  I usually double it for my family; my husband works in a giant tire factory, and has an appetite to match.  The smell makes it hard to wait for it to finish baking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.\nArrange potatoes in the bottom of the casserole dish. Crumble ground beef over potatoes, and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper. Spread onions over meat, and then beans.  Pour undiluted soup over everything.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Cover.\nBake for 30 minutes.  Remove cover, and continue baking for 1 hour.",
