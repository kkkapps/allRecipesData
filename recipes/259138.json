    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nSlice chicken breast through the middle horizontally from one side to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Pound chicken flat until about 1/2-inch thick.\nBeat egg and cream together in a bowl.\nCombine crushed pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, ground black pepper, and Italian seasoning in bowl; transfer breading to a plate.\nDip chicken into egg mixture; coat completely. Press chicken into breading; thickly coat both sides.\nHeat a skillet over medium-high heat; add ghee. Place chicken in the pan; cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Be careful to keep breading in place.\nTransfer chicken to a baking sheet. Cover with tomato sauce; top with mozzarella cheese.\nBroil until cheese is bubbling and barely browned, about 2 minutes.",
