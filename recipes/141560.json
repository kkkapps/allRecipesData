    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.  In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.\nBeat butter and sugar until creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add mashed banana, canola oil, and vanilla. Fold in flour and 1 cup of chocolate chips. Place a dollop of batter into each tortilla, then roll up in a cylinder to form an \"enchilada\"; place into prepared baking dish.\nBake \"enchiladas\" in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes. Melt the remaining 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in a small bowl using the microwave. Drizzle over the \"enchiladas\" as soon as they come out of the oven.",
