Place a ladleful of crepe batter into center of pan, tilting to coat the bottom.  Cook until golden brown on one side, turning once, 2 to 5 minutes.  Continue with remaining batter.\nIn a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.\nTo assemble, spread some melted chocolate on the lighter side of one crepe.  Place a line of overlapping strawberries down the center of the crepe and roll it up.  Top with whipped topping and drizzle with a bit more chocolate.  Repeat with remaining crepes.",
