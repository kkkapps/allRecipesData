    "des": "\"This is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made with semolina and yogurt, then soaked in a rose water syrup. I got this recipe from my sister-in-law.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix together the semolina flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, yogurt, oil, coconut, and baking powder. Set aside for 30 minutes.\nIn a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stir together the water, 1 3/4 cups sugar, and rosewater. Bring to a boil, and boil for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the semolina batter into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Slice into squares or diamonds, and place on almond half onto each piece.\nBake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light brown. Switch the oven setting to broil, and broil until the top is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, and pour the syrup over the squares. Serve warm.",
