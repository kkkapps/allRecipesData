    "des": "\"Wonderful and easy. You can adjust all ingredients to taste. I usually serve with a salad and use reserve marinade as a dressing. When grilling, I flip often and continue brushing to obtain a strong flavor. Is also excellent as a stand-alone dressing.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nWhisk lime juice, olive oil, garlic, soy sauce, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; brush over mahi mahi to coat.\nBake on the preheated grill for 5 minutes, flip, brush again with the lime juice mixture, and continue grilling until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more.",
