    "des": "\"This dish is loved even by those who don't normally like carrots. The flavors blend together beautifully and the hazelnuts provide a nice crunch.\"",
    "ins": "Steam the carrots in a steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water for 7 to 10 minutes, or until tender but still firm. Cool, and grate with a large holed grater. Mix together the grated carrots, honey, apple juice concentrate, parsley, and hazelnuts. Season with garlic powder, nutmeg, salt and pepper.\nHeat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the carrot mixture in the hot butter until heated through.",
