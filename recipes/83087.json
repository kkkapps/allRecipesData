    "des": "\"A zesty treat--Goes great with bbq'd chicken and a beer.  This dish has more of a Thai flavor. For a Japanese flavor, omit the pepper flakes, peanuts, and cilantro. Add 1/4 c. of toasted sesame seeds. If you're feeling adventurous mix in 1/2 c. of shredded dried seaweed (nori) just before serving. You can substitute ramen noodles for soba.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot, cook soba noodles according to package directions. Drain, rinse noodles with cold water, and set aside.\nPour into a large bowl the sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and lime juice. Mix in lime zest, brown sugar, garlic, and red pepper flakes; stir until sugar dissolves. Toss in carrots, peanuts, and cilantro.\nCut noodles into 3-inch lengths. Stir into dressing mixture. Cover, and refrigerate at least 1 hour.\nToss salad again before serving. If dry, splash with soy sauce and vinegar. Serve cold.",
