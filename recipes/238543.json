    "des": "\"Both of my grandmothers made this salad every summer when their gardens produced baskets of cucumbers. It's a cool, fresh side dish for any meal. One of my grandmas omitted the green pepper and the celery seed. She also put ice in it to chill it quickly and cut the vinegar taste.\"",
    "ins": "Place cucumber slices in a colander and liberally sprinkle salt over cucumbers; set aside until water starts to release from cucumbers, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse cucumbers.\nMix cucumbers, onions, and green bell pepper together in a bowl.\nWhisk sugar, vinegar, celery seed, and 2 teaspoons salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; pour over cucumber mixture and stir until evenly coated.",
