    "des": "\"I started this bread because I needed to bake something to bring as a gift to someone's house and quickly found that my ingredients were limited to a few summertime fruits and veggies and not much else. As such, I improvised and changed a few things around from a zucchini bread recipe and created this healthy, hearty, summertime bread. It has a slightly different flavor than zucchini bread but the same moist consistency and sweet, summery taste and smell. Note: it is not very sweet and does taste 'healthy', so it's probably not a big hit for kids unless chocolate chips are added.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch bread pan.\nWhisk squash, honey, blueberry syrup, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; add blueberries and walnuts. Stir flour mixture into squash mixture just until combined; pour into prepared bread pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.",
