    "des": "\"Family Recipe, a staple once a year when fresh tuna was available in my area. It's pretty spicy, so it is generally served with boiled potatoes which are perfect for soaking up the sauce. The sauce is awesome and stands up to the very meaty fish. For some reason, long lost, my grandmother always asked for the darkest tuna steaks they had. She insisted they were better. Pretty sure my grandmother used lard for frying, my aunt says butter and oil do fine.  Any vegetable oil is fine if you don't buy you olive oil by the gallon. Plate the fish with some rice or potatoes (both if you are Portugues).\"",
    "ins": "In a large resealable plastic bag, mix 3 tablespoons pimenta moida, 1/4 cup cider vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 teaspoon pepper, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and 2 tablespoons hot paprika. Place tuna steaks in the bag, seal, and gently shake to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator 1 1/2 to 3 hours.\nMelt the butter and heat the olive oil in a large, heavy cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Discard marinade, and place tuna steaks in the skillet. Fry 2 1/2 minutes on each side, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Remove from skillet and drain on paper towels.\nMix 1/4 cup pimenta moida, ketchup, 1/4 cup cider vinegar, water, 2 tablespoons hot paprika, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon garlic powder into the skillet. Scrape up browned bits, and cook sauce 3 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Scoop a portion of the sauce over the cooked fish to serve, and serve remaining sauce as a gravy for rice and potatoes.",
