    "des": "\"A spicy chili-flavored rub is used to add depth and complexity to grilled flank steak. Top with cool and creamy avocado salsa, roll up in a warm corn tortilla, and you have a wonderful summer meal. Serve with a leafy green salad and cilantro-lime rice to round out the menu.\"",
    "ins": "Place the avocados, onion, tomato, garlic, and cilantro into a mixing bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon cumin, 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes, lime juice, and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir gently until evenly combined; set aside.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Combine the kosher salt, 2 tablespoons cumin, 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, ground black pepper, coriander, chili powder, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside.\nDry the flank steak with paper towels, and rub the spice mixture onto both sides. Cook on the preheated grill until the flank steak starts to firm, and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove the steak from the grill, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest 5 minutes before slicing against the grain. Arrange onto a platter, and top with salsa to serve.",
