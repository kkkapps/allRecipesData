    "des": "\"These are wonderfully delicious, spicy, sweet, salty, sticky Asian-style chicken wings. The garlic and ginger-spiced hoisin and teriyaki sauces, combined with the brown sugar and hot garlic chili sauce, make these wings fly off the platter! They make a great appetizer or light meal for watching the big game. They are excellent served with extra sauce as a dipping sauce or with an Asian slaw.\"",
