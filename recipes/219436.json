    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.\nCream together the butter, kiwi, brown sugar and white sugar in a large bowl, until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract. Combine flour, baking soda, and toasted oat cereal in a bowl; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until light brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
