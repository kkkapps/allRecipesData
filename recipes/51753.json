    "des": "\"Mustard based sauces are definitively South Carolina. This one will definitely satisfy your needs. This is for the big fatty ribs, not the baby backs. Do not trim the fat from the ribs. This method renders out fat and keeps ribs moist. If you do not have a smoker available, this can also be done in the oven.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, lemon juice, white vinegar, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses and mustard. Season with granulated garlic, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, white pepper and cayenne pepper, and mix well. Set aside.\nPreheat an outdoor grill or smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C).\nRub ribs liberally with barbeque seasoning, then place them in the smoker or grill, and cover. Cook for 4 hours, or until very tender. The meat will easily separate from the bone. Baste ribs with mustard sauce liberally during the final 30 minutes. Heat remaining sauce to a boil, and serve on the side.",
