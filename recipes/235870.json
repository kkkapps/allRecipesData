Lightly grease baking sheets.\nCut dough into quarters and roll each quarter onto a floured work surface to almost 1/4-inch thickness. Cut dough into shapes using cookie cutters and arrange on the prepared baking sheets.\nBake each batch in the preheated oven until edges start to brown, about 8 minutes.",
