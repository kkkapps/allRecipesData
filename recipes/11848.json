    "des": "\"I was making pasta for a friend who is on a wheat-free diet and almost despaired until I discovered white spelt flour. Don't confuse it and use regular organic spelt flour. Well, you can substitute, but it's not as much like wheat flour pasta ...\"",
    "ins": "(Preferred) Process all ingredients in a food processor until they form a ball that rides on the blades.\nYou can also let a bread machine knead the ingredients for about 5 minutes. (I've never tried this, but have heard it works well.)\nPasta can be rolled and cut in a regular (manual, hand-crank) pasta maker by passing it through repeatedly smaller (i.e., higher number) settings until nearly paper thin, and then run through the cutting blades. I am told it does not do so well in an automatic pasta maker.",
