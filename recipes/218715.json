    "des": "\"Pasta is tossed with white beans, roasted tomatoes, fresh basil, and a garlic infused olive oil. Serve with crusty bread to soak up the sauce and any leftover garlic olive oil. This isn't a hot pasta dish so it's perfect for summer.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the olive oil and garlic in a small bowl.  Set aside.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nPlace the pasta, beans, tomatoes, basil, and 2 tablespoons of the garlic olive oil in a large bowl; toss gently until combined. Serve the remaining olive oil at the table to drizzle over individual servings.",
