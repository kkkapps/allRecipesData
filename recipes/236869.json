    "des": "\"I started with the Peking Pork Chops recipe (Thanks, Lynda!) from this site, reviewed the reviews, and made some adjustments of my own to get the precise flavor combination I've been seeking. They're easy to prepare, and everyone I've served has raved that they're fork-tender and flavorful without being overly spicy. Serve over steamed rice (basmati, jasmine, or white).\"",
