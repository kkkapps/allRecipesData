    "ins": "Lightly grease a large skillet and cook chicken until no longer pink; remove and reserve.\nIn a food processor, add onion to puree, then add cheese to puree. Add chicken and puree a final time.\nIn a large bowl, add flour and make a well in the center. Add eggs and mix well; add water and adjust with flour and water as needed. Dough should be elastic, but not sticky.\nIn a small bowl, beat 1 egg and add one tablespoon of water. On a floured surface, roll out dough until it is 1/4 inch thick or almost paper thin. Cut out 2 inch circles and brush with egg and water mixture. Place 1 teaspoon of stuffing in the middle of the circle and fold over. Seal the half moon by crimping the edge.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add half moons and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until al dente; drain and serve.",
