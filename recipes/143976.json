    "des": "\"Maui chicken is a festive dish featuring succulent chicken breast, sweet red and orange peppers and mushrooms. This colorful dish is then simmered in a spicy ginger, garlic, and pineapple sauce. The combination is as delightful as the Maui sunset. Serve over white or brown rice.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the chicken, soy sauce, and 1 can of pineapple tidbits with juice in a bowl. Allow chicken to marinate for 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the marinade; strain the marinade in a colander, reserving the juice. Discard the pineapple.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the red bell pepper, orange bell pepper, mushrooms, garlic, and ginger. Cook and stir the vegetable mixture until the garlic is fragrant and the peppers begin to soften. Stir in the chicken and cook until the juices from the chicken run clear, about 15 minutes.\nPour in the reserved chicken marinade, 1 can of pineapple tidbits with juice, black bean sauce, and crushed red pepper; season with salt and pepper; simmer 5 minutes.",
