    "des": "\"Biryani is a rice dish from the Indian subcontinent and is very popular here in Kuwait since most of the Arab dishes originated from India. Most of the Filipinos here in Kuwait like to eat biryani but they hate the spices like cardamom, cinnamon, saffron, etc. that it is flavored with. I am one of those who doesn't like these spices so I made this dish in my own way with the spices that we Filipinos prefer.\"",
