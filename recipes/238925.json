Gradually add flour mixture alternately with sour cream, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended. Stir in cranberries, white morsels, chocolate morsels and pecans. Cover and chill at least 1 hour.\nDrop dough by rounded teaspoons, 2 inches apart, onto prepared baking sheets. Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until centers of cookies are set and edges are browned lightly.

Add milk, a few teaspoons at a time, until glaze is of desired consistency, stirring constantly. Spread a little glaze on top of each cookie. Let stand until glaze is set.",
