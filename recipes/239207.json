    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease or line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.\nBeat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding the next egg. Mix vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture.\nWhisk flour, walnuts, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Mix 1/3 of the flour mixture into the creamed butter mixture until just combined; add 1/2 of the milk and mix until combined. Stir 1/2 of the remaining flour mixture into the batter; add the remaining milk and mix until combined. Mix the remaining flour mixture into the batter and fold in carrots. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes.",
