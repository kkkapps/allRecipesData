    "des": "\"Poutine originated from rural Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec province in the 1950s. \nI would say poutine is not second to any other food in Canada. \nI order poutine when I go to diners, but I also buy fresh cheese curd to make my own at home. \nHomemade gravy is really easy and quick to make. \nThe only rule I don't follow for authentic poutine is that I don't fry my French fries; \nI bake them in the oven. \nBe careful. This is very addictive!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nSpread fries in a single layer over prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour vigorously. When mixture bubbles, reduce heat to low; cook and stir until the mixture thins, about 2 minutes. Whisk in beef broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy has thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nPlace fries on a serving plate or in individual bowls. Distribute the cheese curds over the fries; pour hot gravy over the fries and curds. Serve immediately.",
