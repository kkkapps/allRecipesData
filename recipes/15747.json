    "des": "\"This really is the best banana bread I have ever tasted.  Very moist and it freezes well. I also bake this in 3 small loaf pans however you may need to shorten the baking time.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray one 9x5 inch loaf pan with non-stick spray coating.\nBlend together the eggs, buttermilk, oil and bananas.\nSift together the sugar, flour, baking soda and salt. Add to banana mixture and stir in pecans. Mix well.\nPour into prepared loaf pan and bake 1 hour and 20 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.",
