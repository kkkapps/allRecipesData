    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut a slit in each date. Place almonds inside slits. Press together the dates to close slits. Wrap each date with a piece of bacon.\nLine a shallow baking pan with Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Add a roasting rack; place the dates on rack. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes or until bacon is crisp. Serve immediately with toothpicks. Dates will be hot inside.",
