    "des": "\"This dip is similar to white cheese sauces served in many Mexican restaurants.  The amount of heat can be adjusted by adding your favorite chili pepper or crushed cayenne pepper to taste.  As is, it is kid-friendly, quick, and delicious!  It can be used as a dip for tortilla chips or a sauce for many Mexican dishes.\"",
    "ins": "Place cheese, milk, and butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Cook until cheese has melted, stirring frequently. Stir in green chilies, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper to taste. Add more milk if dip is too thick. Heat through and serve immediately.",
