    "des": "\"A recipe that was handed down through the years from Mother to Daughter.  It's just a simple and easy 'Apple Pudding' recipe. When you are in a hurry and have very few staples on hand, you may want to give this dessert a try.  That is the basic recipe and good for the times of depression when extras are scarce. Serve either hot or cold. It is good plain but better with milk, cream, whipped cream or lemon sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nToss apples with flour, sugar and salt and place in a 9x9 inch baking dish.  Pour enough milk into dish to come almost to the top of the apples, but not cover them.\nBake in preheated oven 45 minutes, until apples are tender.",
