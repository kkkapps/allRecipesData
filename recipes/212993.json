Add the chicken and chorizo; season with salt and pepper. Cover the pot and cook for 5 minutes.\nPour enough water over the chicken to cover completely; bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cover, and cook another 10 minutes. Stir the plantains, potatoes, garbanzo beans, and cabbage into the mixture. Cook covered until the cabbage is wilted and everything is hot, about 5 minutes more. Serve hot.",
