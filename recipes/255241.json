    "ins": "Combine chicken broth and beef bouillon in a bowl.\nCook sausage in a skillet over medium heat until brown and crumbled, about 5 minutes. Add beef, green onions, white onion, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper. Stir in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce; cook and stir until flavors combine, 2 to 4 minutes.\nSprinkle flour onto the beef mixture; stir until absorbed, about 1 minute. Stir in broth mixture; bring to a boil. Add remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Reduce heat; simmer until beef is cooked through and onions are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.\nRemove beef mixture from heat; stir in sour cream.\nFill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Transfer to a serving plate; top with beef mixture.",
