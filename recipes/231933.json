    "des": "\"I got this recipe out of one of my mother's cookbooks and tried it one Christmas Eve with her. They were amazing! My brother even loved them, and he is the pickiest person I know. When they were done I threw one to my dog. They are now his favorite treat of all. Hopefully, you will love this recipe as much as we do!\"",
