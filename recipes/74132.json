    "ins": "Pound steaks using a meat mallet to tenderize. Place in a shallow glass dish, and pour the vinegar over the steaks so that they are covered. Refrigerate for 30 to 45 minutes to marinate.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Beat eggs in a shallow dish, and set aside. Place flour in a separate dish. Dip steaks in flour, then in egg, then in flour again. Place in the hot oil, and fry on each side until deep golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Serve immediately.",
