    "des": "\"A hearty comfort casserole of brown rice and lentils, topped off with melted Cheddar cheese and bread crumbs.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan, bring water and bouillon cubes to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 50 minutes, or until rice is tender and all liquid has been absorbed.\nHeat oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook zucchini and onion until tender, but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Stir in cumin, oregano, lentils, and about 6 cups water gradually. Bring to a soft boil, and continue cooking until lentils are tender, 45 to 60 minutes, adding water as needed.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix the cooked rice together with the lentils, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in 3/4 of the Cheddar cheese, and transfer mixture into a 9x13 inch pan. Mix remaining cheese together with the breadcrumbs, and spread evenly over the top of the dish.\nBake in the preheated oven just until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes.",
