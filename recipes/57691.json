    "des": "\"This cobbler combines huckleberries and peaches. Blueberries can be substituted if huckleberries aren't available. It's great served warm with vanilla ice cream. This cobbler works great with either fresh or frozen fruits.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIf you're using frozen fruit, thaw and drain it before proceeding. Combine fruit in an ungreased 2-quart casserole dish. Mix the cornstarch and 2/3 cup sugar, and toss with fruit mixture. Dot with 2 tablespoons butter and set aside.\nSift the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a bowl. Stir in the oats, lemon zest, and cinnamon. Cut in 1/4 cup butter until it's the size of small peas. Stir in milk to form a stiff batter. Spoon dollops of cobbler batter over the fruit in the casserole dish; the batter may not entirely cover the fruit.\nBake in the preheated oven until the  fruit is bubbling and the topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool about 15 minutes. Serve warm.",
