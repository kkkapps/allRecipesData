    "des": "\"The vanille kipferl originated in Austria, and they are also very popular in Switzerland and Germany. The kipferl become even yummier after 2 to 3 days...but only for those who can resist long enough. If desired, the two ends of the kipferl can be dipped in warm chocolate and then left to cool.\"",
    "ins": "In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in the butter until the size of small peas and mix in with your hands.\nMix 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, the egg, 3 teaspoons of vanilla sugar, and ground almonds into the flour mixture. Place the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nDivide the dough into several parts. Roll each section of dough into logs approximately 1/2 inch thick. Cut the logs into 1-inch pieces, and bend the pieces into a crescent shape (just like a croissant). Place the kipferl on the baking sheet and chill them for 15 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly.\nCombine 6 tablespoons confectioners' sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla sugar and toss to mix.\nWhile still warm, carefully remove kipferl from the baking sheet and dip them in sugar to coat.",
