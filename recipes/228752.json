    "des": "\"Devilishly good and (almost) paleo-approved! Use the leftover drippings to fry some side-dish veggies, or just drizzle on top of the completed chicken. Go ahead and modify the cheese; any stinky cheese will do. Can also substitute candied walnuts or pecans for standard walnuts for a unique sweet-and-savory flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPound chicken slices until they are even in thickness and about 1/4-inch thick. Spread blue cheese and walnuts on top of each chicken piece. Roll chicken breasts over filling.\nPlace 2 bacon slices side by side on a work surface. Place each chicken roll at one end of bacon slices and roll bacon around chicken; secure with toothpicks. Repeat with remaining chicken rolls and bacon.\nHeat a skillet to medium-high heat and cook bacon-wrapped chicken rolls in the hot skillet until the bacon is browned and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken rolls to preheated oven; bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.",
