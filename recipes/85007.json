These are no fancy joes - nothing but lots of sloppy, zesty mess! Beef may be used instead of turkey. Perfect for potluck or game day. Serve on your favorite buns.\"",
    "ins": "Place the turkey in a large skillet over medium heat, cook until evenly brown, and drain.\nIn a large saucepan over medium heat, mix the ketchup, sugar, vinegar, and mustard. Mix in the turkey. Cook, stirring often, 30 minutes.",
