    "des": "\"Pork shoulder is a popular cut of meat, but it's almost always cooked until fork-tender, which, to your average cook, means 'falling apart.' This is fine for pulled pork sandwiches (or many other amazing dishes), but sometimes I want something different.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nSeason roast generously on all sides with salt and black pepper.\nHeat olive oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Cook roast in hot oil until browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add shallot, cut-side down, to skillet and place rosemary sprigs on top of roast.\nRoast pork in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Flip pork, place rosemary sprigs back on top of roast, and break up shallots with a spoon. Continue roasting until slightly pink in the center, about 45 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nTransfer roast to a platter to rest for 10 minutes. Drizzle any excess fat in the skillet over the top of roast.\nPlace the same skillet over medium heat. Stir blueberries into skillet and cook and stir until soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour port wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.\nStir chicken broth into blueberry mixture, increase heat to medium-high, and cook until liquid is reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low, stir cold butter into sauce and whisk until completely incorporated. Strain sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.\nSlice pork roast against the grain into thin slices and top with blueberry sauce.",
