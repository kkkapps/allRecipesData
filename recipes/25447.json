    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together the barbeque sauce, steak sauce, beer, bourbon whiskey, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, seasoned salt, black pepper, dried onion, basil, oregano, habanero hot sauce, curry powder, red pepper flakes, and brown sugar.\nCover the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with approximately 1/2 the marinade. Place desired meat in the dish, and cover with remaining mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 6 hours before grilling as desired.",
