    "des": "\"This was my Grandma's secret family recipe from her French ancestors. I have never seen a recipe like this on any site. It's a rich creamy sauce over chicken...great with mashed potatoes. A great dish for Easter or Christmas.\"",
    "ins": "Mix flour and margarine together in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the flour and margarine form a paste.\nWhisk cream into flour mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until smoothly combined; whisk in chicken broth and parsley. Bring sauce to a simmer, whisking constantly until thickened.\nWhisk egg yolks and lemon juice together in a bowl.\nWhisk egg yolk mixture slowly into cream mixture, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce barely comes to a simmer and coats the back of a spoon. Do not boil.\nIf thicker sauce is desired, whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sauce in a small bowl; stir cornstarch mixture back into sauce until thickened, about 2 minutes.\nStir chicken breast pieces into sauce until chicken is heated through.",
