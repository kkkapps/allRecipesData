    "ins": "Mix together the shortening, egg, and confectioners' sugar.  Stir in vanilla, cream of tartar, salt, baking soda and flour.  Mix well.\nRoll dough into 1 inch in diameter balls.   Place on cookie sheet.  Press down with a glass bottom dipped in sugar.  ( I have also used cookie stamps dipped into sugar.)\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 10 minutes or just until edges are turning golden.  Let cool slightly before removing from the cookie sheet.",
