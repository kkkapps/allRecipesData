    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a deep-dish pie plate with 1 pie crust.\nBeat ricotta cheese, eggs, Parmesan cheese, milk, wine, and mustard together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir basket cheese, roasted ham, and Italian-style ham into the ricotta mixture; season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture into the crust.\nCut remaining pie crust into 3/4-inch strips and arrange to make a lattice over the top of the pie. Crimp and flute edges.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Leave pie out to cool to room temperature before refrigerating to chill completely.",
