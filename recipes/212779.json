    "ins": "Stir together the cottage cheese, chopped peaches, 3 tablespoons white sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the almond extract in a bowl until evenly combined. Stir together the sour cream and brown sugar in a separate bowl. Refrigerate both fillings until ready to use.\nWhisk together the flour, 1 tablespoon of white sugar, the baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the nutmeg in a bowl. Beat the eggs, milk, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until no lumps remain.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle to form silver dollar-sized blintzes. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.\nTo assemble, spread 1 tablespoon of peach filling on top of each blintz. Stack together 5 blintzes to make a serving portion, and spoon the sweetened sour cream overtop. Garnish with peach slices.",
