    "des": "\"An easy stew you can prep and let simmer for a few hours. Easy to prep the night before and toss in the slow cooker when you get home, for a good down-home meal. Serve with hot boiled potatoes. I have also cut potatoes into cubes and put them right in the slow cooker to save time and dishes. Works great!\n\"",
    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large nonstick skillet, and cook over medium heat until crisp and brown. Remove the bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the drippings in the skillet.\nPlace the flour, salt, black pepper, and allspice in a large plastic zipper bag, and shake a few times to combine. Place the beef stew meat into the bag, and shake to coat the meat with flour mixture. Place the meat pieces in the skillet with the bacon drippings, and cook the meat until brown on all sides.\nRemove the browned meat to a slow cooker, and add the carrots, onions, garlic, parsley, rosemary, marjoram, and bay leaf to the cooker.\nPour the beer into the skillet, and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, scraping all the browned bits of flavor from the bottom of the skillet. Pour the beer into the slow cooker, over the meat and vegetables. Cover, and cook on Medium setting until the meat is very tender, 4 to 5 hours.\nBefore serving, remove the bay leaf, and sprinkle the stew with the reserved bacon pieces.",
