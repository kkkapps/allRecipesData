Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. When cookies have cooled, turn them over and look at the bottom to see the \"brown rim\".",
