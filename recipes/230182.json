Slice rolls in half horizontally.\nArrange sliced corned beef and Swiss cheese on bottom half of each roll and cover with top portion of roll. Wrap each sandwich in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake rolls 8 to 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and sandwich is warm. While sandwiches are baking, combine cabbage and dressing together in a small bowl.\nRemove sandwiches from aluminum foil, gently open sandwich and spoon some cabbage salad atop meat. Gently press sandwiches back together again. Serve with extra dressing if desired.",
