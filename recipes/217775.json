    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nMelt 1/2 cup of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the green onions and mushrooms, and cook until the mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the shrimp and walleye; cook and stir until the shrimp have begun to turn opaque, about 2 minutes. Add the lobster and crab, and cook a few minutes to heat.\nStir in the sherry and white wine. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 2 minutes. Once the shrimp and walleye are no longer translucent in the center, stir in the cream of shrimp soup, half-and-half, 1 cup bread crumbs, and Cheddar cheese until the cheese has melted, and the mixture is bubbly. Pour into a casserole dish, and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and the Parmesan cheese. Dot with the pieces of cold butter.\nCook under the preheated broiler until the butter has melted and the bread crumbs are golden brown.",
