    "des": "\"Polenta baked with Gorgonzola and grated Parmesan is also known as polenta concia. It's a typical dish of the Northern Italian Lombardy region, where Gorgonzola is also from. Polenta requires a long cooking time, about 45 minutes in a regular pot, but the pressure cooker allows to bring to the table an original Italian dish in a little more than half an hour!\"",
    "ins": "Brush the bottom of a stovetop pressure cooker with olive oil. Pour in water. Heat until bubbles start to appear on the sides of the cooker, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle in polenta a little at a time, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Add salt.\nIncrease heat to high and seal cooker. Cook until steam starts to escape. Reduce heat to low; cook for 18 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.\nRelease pressure from the cooker according to manufacturer's instructions. Place cooker on a damp cloth and remove lid gently. Let stand, 30 seconds to 1 minute.\nStir the polenta; spread half into the greased baking dish. Sprinkle half the Gorgonzola cheese and half the Parmesan cheese on top. Dot with some of the butter. Repeat with remaining polenta, cheeses, and butter.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheeses are melted, about 10 minutes. Broil until top is golden, about 5 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
