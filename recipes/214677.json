    "des": "\"Razor Clam in Sha Cha Sauce is one of my favorite dishes. Sha Cha is a type of sauce which is actually from my hometown. I was so glad to find it in the US, it makes this dish so tasty. I almost felt like I was home. In the store, Sha Cha Sauce is actually spelled 'Sa Cha'. If you cannot find razor clams with shell on, you may substitute razor clams with Manila clams. It will be also delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir the ginger into the hot oil, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the razor clams in their shells, and cook until all of the clams have opened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the sa cha sauce and water, and bring to a boil. Toss with the bell pepper and green onions to serve.",
