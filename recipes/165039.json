    "des": "\"This is a quick and easy appetizer or main dish focusing on a garlic lime marinade and thick slices of peppered bacon wrapped around green chilies and shrimp. This recipe works exceptionally well on an indoor grill.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the oil, lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Toss the shrimp in the marinade, then refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nPreheat an indoor electric grill for medium-high heat.\nRemove the shrimp from the marinade, and shake off excess. Wrap each shrimp with a strip of chili pepper, then half a bacon slice. Secure with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining shrimp. Cook on preheated grill until the bacon is crisp, and the shrimp is hot, 6 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle the shrimp with diced avocado, and garnish with lime wedges to serve.",
