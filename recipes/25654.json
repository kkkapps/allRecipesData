    "des": "\"Wonderful soup for those cold, rainy or snowy days!  My family absolutely loves this hearty soup. The warming zip of cayenne gives it a taste all its own.  This is also excellent to reheat in the microwave for a fast meal.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine water, potatoes, carrots, onion, bell pepper, jalapeno and garlic.  Sprinkle salt and bouillon over the mixture.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, until potatoes are tender.\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until brown; drain.\nStir cooked beef and 2 cups milk into the soup and heat through.  Combine remaining 1/2 cup milk with flour, stirring until smooth; stir into soup.  Bring to a low boil and cook, stirring, until thickened, 3 minutes.\nReduce heat to low and stir in cheese until melted.  Season with cayenne.",
