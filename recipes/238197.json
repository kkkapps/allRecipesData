    "des": "\"Flour dumplings are added to a peach syrupy mixture to create a wonderful dessert. This is an Amish recipe. Using cream or canned milk instead of the milk gives this a creamier texture but also more calories. You can use fresh, frozen, or canned peaches.\"",
    "ins": "Stir water, sugar, and butter together in a pot over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture has a syrupy texture, 5 to 10 minutes. Add peaches to syrup; bring to a boil.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir milk into flour mixture until a stiff batter forms.\nDrop batter by large spoonfuls into boiling peach syrup; cover the pot with a lid, reduce heat to medium, and cook until dumplings are set, about 20 minutes.",
