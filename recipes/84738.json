    "des": "\"This is a Quebec recipe.  Very simple and easy.  You can add nuts if you like. The maple syrup pudding is an 'upgraded' version of poor man's pudding, which uses brown sugar syrup. The maple syrup will sink to the bottom.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking pan.\nIn a medium bowl, beat together sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract using an electric mixer until soft and creamy, at least 10 minutes.\nCombine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the butter mixture a little at a time, alternating with the maple syrup and milk. Just mix enough to moisten. Pour into the prepared pan.\nBake in a preheated oven for 45 minutes. The maple syrup will sink to the bottom, and the top should be lightly browned. Serve warm.",
