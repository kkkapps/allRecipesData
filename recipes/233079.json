Can be served in a punch bowl, or individual servings. Garnish with cherries, orange slices or other desired fresh fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Pour limeade into a large pitcher with a lid; stir in water, rum, grenadine syrup, lime juice, and bitters until well mixed. Cover pitcher and freeze punch until slushy, 8 hours to overnight.\nFill individual serving glasses with ice; Spoon about 3 tablespoons punch-slush mixture over ice. Top with club soda and stir gently.",
