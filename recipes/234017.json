    "des": "\"Creamy yellow pea soup studded with bits of ham, carrots, celery, and thyme. There is nothing like this one on a cold day! I am a Canadian now living in the US. and cannot get Habitant\u00c2\u00ae soup anymore, so I came up with this version. I think it is as good as the real thing, if not better, because it is homemade.\"",
    "ins": "Place split peas, ham bone, carrots, onion, celery, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into a large pot; pour in water. Bring mixture to a boil and skim off any foam with a spoon. Reduce heat; place a lid on the pot slightly ajar to allow some evaporation. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until peas are tender and soup is thick, about 3 hours.\nRemove ham bone from soup; strip meat from ham bone, chop meat, and return it to the pot.",
