    "des": "\"My husband loves this quicker, hearty version of an old-time favorite!  Lower-salt ingredients also work well.  Use the simmer time to call a friend, start the wash, or help the kids with homework!  Makes great leftovers too!  Serve with crusty French bread, or hearty whole wheat slices!  Enjoy!\"",
