Grease an 8-inch square baking pan and set aside.\nTo make the streusel, combine 1/3 cup pancake mix, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl. Cut it the margarine until mixture is crumbly. (This can also be done in the food processor: pulse mixture 2 to 3 times to combine.)\nStir together the 2 cups of pancake mix, soy milk, sugar, and egg just until combined. Spread into prepared pan. Sprinkle with cinnamon streusel.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool before serving.",
