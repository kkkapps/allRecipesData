    "des": "\"This recipe for nut bread has been handed down from my grandmother and is sooo delicious. It's easy to make and everyone who tries it always asked for the recipe. For best results, mix with a wooden spoon, not with an electric mixer. It will overmix and become tough.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pas.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the sugar, eggs, vegetable oil and vanilla until smooth using a wooden spoon. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; stir into the sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk just until mixed. Stir in the walnuts. Divide the batter evenly between the two pans.\nBake for 55 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the crown comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool for about 10 minutes before removing from the pans, and wrap in aluminum foil.",
