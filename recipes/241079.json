    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and jalapeno in hot oil until just translucent and softening, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir pickled peppers and 1/4 cup reserved pickling liquid into onion mixture; cook and stir until liquid reduces and flavors blend, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt.",
