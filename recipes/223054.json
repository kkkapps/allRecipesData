    "des": "\"My grandparents came from Pontevedra, Spain in 1920 through Ellis Island and brought this recipe with them. I grew up eating this dish and my children just love it. Of course, they never measured anything, so the measurements are just an estimate.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the chicken pieces in a roasting pan skin-side down. Pour the olive oil and melted butter over the chicken. Sprinkle the pieces with minced roasted garlic, paprika, salt, and pepper.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces skin-side up and roast until the chicken is done and the skin is crispy, about 25 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nServe the chicken pieces with the sauce on the side for dipping.",
