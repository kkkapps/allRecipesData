    "des": "\"If you've ever wondered what to do with a spaghetti squash, or you're tired of serving it with marinara sauce, here's a recipe for you. It's special enough for company and simple enough for every day. Based on the classic spaghetti carbonara, spaghetti squash is roasted in the oven and finished with a sauce of garlic, leeks, white wine, Parmesan, and a bit of bacon.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSprinkle sea salt and ground black pepper into the bottom of a baking dish. Put squash halves into the baking dish with the cut sides facing downward. Pour enough water into the pan to be about 1/4-inch deep.\nRoast squash in preheated oven until flesh is tender, 60 to 90 minutes. Shred the flesh from the squash into strands and to a colander to drain excess liquid.\nBeat eggs, Parmesan cheese, and 3 tablespoons parsley together in a bowl.\nPut bacon into a skillet and place over medium heat; cook and stir until browned but not yet crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess fat from the pan, retaining about 2 tablespoons. Cook and stir leek with the bacon until soft, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.\nPour white wine over the bacon mixture; cook until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir squash into the bacon mixture; cook and stir until any remaining moisture from the squash evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes.\nGently stir the egg mixture into the squash mixture; cook until the liquid makes a creamy sauce and is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with pepper. Garnish with parsley and Parmesan cheese.",
