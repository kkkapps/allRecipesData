    "des": "\"I made up this one-pot curry one night when I came home hungry from work and wanted to whip up something quick but exciting. It mixes sweet, spicy, sour, and savory flavors and is easy to make in under an hour. You can augment it with extra vegetables if you want. Correct seasoning, adding more mango juice if too spicy or tart. Serve over hot basmati rice.\"",

Add curry paste to onion mixture.\nMix chicken into onion mixture until chicken is coated in curry paste; cook and stir until chicken is lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.\nStir mango nectar, tomato paste, and vinegar into chicken mixture. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce is thickened and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.",
