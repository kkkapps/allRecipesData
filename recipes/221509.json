    "des": "\"A great company dish. The secret is to not cook the chicken all the way through when browning. Brown in batches if needed. It comes out nice and tender this way. Serve with rice or linguini and a side salad.\"",
    "ins": "Season chicken cutlets with salt and black pepper. Pour flour into a shallow dish. Press chicken cutlets into flour to coat each side, shaking to remove any excess flour.\nMelt butter in a large skillet. Cook chicken in hot butter until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side; remove from skillet and set aside.\nMix chicken broth, Marsala wine, and garlic into the remaining butter in the skillet; reduce heat to low and cook until the liquid is hot, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms, tomato, rosemary, and basil into the liquid. Return chicken to the skillet. Place a cover on the skillet and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, about 30 minutes.",
