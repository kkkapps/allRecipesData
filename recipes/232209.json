    "des": "\"This is a fresh, healthy, easy-to-make salad with a twist to the usual restaurant versions. It can be served in small portions as an appetizer salad, or in large portions as a whole meal. This recipe is for 4 larger salads.\"",
    "ins": "Mix tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, 1 clove minced garlic, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl; toss to coat. Cover bowl and refrigerate.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nPlace steak in a large resealable bag; add 1 clove minced garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper. Seal the bag and distribute the oil mixture over the steak.\nCook the steak on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before thinly slicing across the grain.\nDivide lettuce onto 4 serving plates; drizzle about 1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar and 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil onto each lettuce portion. Top each salad with 1/4 the steak and 1/4 the tomato mixture.",
