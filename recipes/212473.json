    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish.\nPour 1 or 2 tablespoons of water into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Place the broccoli florets and chopped broccoli into the saucepan with the water, cover, and cook over medium heat until thawed, about 5 minutes. Drain off the water, and stir the cream cheese into the hot broccoli. Spread the broccoli mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nMix the bread crumbs with butter in a bowl, and spread over the broccoli in an even layer. Sprinkle the top with almonds, and bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and the dish is bubbling, 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
