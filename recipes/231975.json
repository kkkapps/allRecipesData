    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nMix milk and lime juice together in a bowl.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, lime zest, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl; mix butter into flour mixture using two knives or a pastry blender until crumbly. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until just moistened.\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured work surface; knead a few times. Gently shape dough into a 3/4-inch thick disk; cut into 12 biscuits using a 2 1/2-inch floured cutter or the rim of a small juice glass. Reshape scraps as needed. Arrange biscuits on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.",
