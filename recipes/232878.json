    "des": "\"I came across this recipe in a grocery store flyer just before Canadian Thanksgiving. I am not a pumpkin pie fan although the rest of the family is. I should say they were. The dessert is all gone but half of a pumpkin pie remains.  This will be a new tradition at our Thanksgiving table. Serve with whipped cream.\"",
