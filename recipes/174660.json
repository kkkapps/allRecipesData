I transfer some of the sauce to a plastic squeeze bottle for serving, and keep the rest in a glass quart jar in the refrigerator. Be sure to let the sauce come to room temperature before serving (you can warm it in the microwave if you want.)\"",

Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 30 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. Remove from the stove and pour into a heatproof bowl. Cover, and refrigerate the sauce for 2 days.\nStrain the sauce through a mesh sieve to remove the red pepper flakes. Store the sauce in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.",
