    "des": "\"I've been making collard greens for years but my newly vegetarian daughter won't eat them prepared with the usual fatback used for seasoning anymore. I made this recipe up one afternoon and my family has been clamoring for these ever since! \nReally great flavors that meld together over the entire cooking time. They really are so good. They try to eat them right out of the pot! Serve with some hot sauce and vinegar on the side with your favorite meal. I promise you won't have any leftovers they are so good!\"",

Bring liquid to a boil.\nMix collard greens, jalapeno peppers, and garlic into boiling water; return to a boil. Cover stockpot, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until greens are very tender, 3 to 4 hours.\nDrain water from greens and mash garlic cloves; season with salt and pepper.",
