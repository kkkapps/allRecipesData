Wrap bacon snugly around each hot dog, securing each end with a toothpick.\nPreheat oil in a saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCarefully drop the hot dogs in the hot oil, and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or until bacon is brown and crispy. Remove from oil, and drain on paper towels. Remove and discard toothpicks. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.",
