    "des": "\"On the back of a McCann's\u00c2\u00ae Quick Cooking Irish Oatmeal box I noticed a recipe for 'Irish Oatmeal Cookies.' I more or less followed the recipe substituting things here and there, and the results were \u00c3\u00bcber-delicious. Perfect for a coffee or tea break snack or breakfast. I would have added some cinnamon if my hubby didn't dislike that flavor so much. Please try it! Here's what I did.\"",
