    "des": "\"You HAVE to let this steak sit overnight. Don't bother making it if you can't put in the time, because the payoff is worth it. This staple in our household is a favorite of all who try it! You can BBQ in summer or broil in the winter for a perfect, filling meal. I like corn on the cob and some sort of rice to complement this mouth watering steak.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix together the honey, soy sauce, and red wine. Stir in garlic, rosemary, chili powder, and pepper. Let stand for 15 minutes to blend the flavors.\nPlace the marinade and the steak into a large resealable plastic bag. Press out most of the air, seal, and lay flat in the refrigerator. Refrigerate for 24 hours, turning once halfway through.\nPreheat grill for high heat.\nBrush grill grate with oil. Discard marinade, and grill the flank steak for 7 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing very thinly against the grain.",
