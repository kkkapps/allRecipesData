    "des": "\"This recipe uses a white bread straight dough as the base. When making raisin bread, you may use brown sugar instead of white. Grated orange or lemon rind may be added.\"",
    "ins": "Scald milk.\nSoften yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes.\nPour scalded milk over sugar, shortening, and salt in a bowl. When lukewarm, blend in raisins and 1 cup flour.\nStir in yeast and beat well. Add 3 cups flour, continue beating until smooth. Beat in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn on lightly floured surface; let rest about 5 minutes.\nKnead until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased bowl; turn to bring greased surface to top. Cover, let stand in warm place until dough is doubled, about 1 hour.\nPunch down, cover, and let rise again until almost doubled in bulk.\nTurn on lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half; let rest 5 to 10 minutes.\nShape into loaves. Place in 2 greased loaf pans 9 1/2 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4 inches. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.\nBake in a 400 degree F (205 degrees C) oven for about 50 minutes.",
