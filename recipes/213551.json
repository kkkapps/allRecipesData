    "des": "\"Old recipe from French-Canadian Memere (Grandma). Delicious and spicy pork spread for sandwiches.  Pronounced 'gah-ton'. Enjoy on a sandwich with mustard or eat alone.\"",
    "ins": "Place the pork, onion, cinnamon, and clove into a saucepan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour in water to just cover the meat. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the water has nearly evaporated, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally to ensure the pork cooks evenly.\nUse a potato masher or wire whisk to break the pork into thin strands. Pour off any remaining liquid, then spoon the gorton into a serving bowl. Refrigerate until cold before serving.",
