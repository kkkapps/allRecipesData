    "des": "\"Springfield, Missouri is the home of Cashew Chicken. This is supposed to be Leong's original recipe. Leong and his brother Gee developed this famous dish, creating a fried chicken with an Asian flair in the 1960s. This is the closest recipe I have ever found to tasting like the original. And since it is supposed to be the original, maybe that is why? There are numerous variations of this famous dish, so it is how you remember it! Make your favorite fried rice or order from your favorite restaurant to go along with the chicken. Enjoy!\"",
