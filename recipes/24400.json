    "des": "\"You can use long grain white rice for all or part of the wild rice, but reduce simmering time to 20 to 30 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over medium heat, combine chicken broth, water, green onions and wild rice.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, 35 to 40 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp.  Allow to cool and then crumble.  Set aside.\nWhen rice is tender, melt the margarine in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir in flour, salt, poultry seasoning and pepper all at once.  Cook, stirring, until smooth and bubbly.  Stir in half-and-half and cook until thickened, 2 minutes.  Stir half-and-half mixture into rice mixture.  Stir in bacon, turkey and sherry.  Heat through and serve.",
