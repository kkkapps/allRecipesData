    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the onion and green pepper; cook until the onion begins to turn brown, about 5 minutes.  Pour in the water, white beans, tomato sauce, garlic, cilantro, and calabaza.  Season with the sazon packet, bouillon cube, salt, pepper, and cumin; stir well to combine.\nBring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until the calabaza has softened, about 20 minutes.  Remove the cover, and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened, about 10 more minutes.",
