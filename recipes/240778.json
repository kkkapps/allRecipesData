    "des": "\"My family raves about this oven-cooked tri tip roast; it's succulent, flavorful, and even my picky 5 year-old loves it! If you want to get a taste of southern California barbeque, this is it. Serve with fresh salsa, tortillas, rice, and beans. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nWhisk kosher salt, black pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, oregano, cayenne pepper, rosemary, sage, lemon pepper, seasoned salt, and beef bouillon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle spice mixture on all sides of roast and rub spices into meat.\nHeat a skillet over high heat. Cook roast in hot skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer meat, fat-side facing up, to a roasting pan. Cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil.\nRoast in the preheated oven until just turning from pink to grey, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Uncover roast and tent loosely with aluminum foil; let rest for 10 minutes before slicing across the grain.",
