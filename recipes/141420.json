    "des": "\"My college roommate took me home to her farm for a weekend visit back in 1962.  This is a salad we had for dinner one night while I was there.  It's been  requested of me ever since then. It's a real tasty addition to any meal.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, add boiling water to the cherry gelatin and stir to dissolve. Carefully add the cinnamon candies. Let them sit for a minute, then stir to dissolve the candies into the gelatin mixture. Once they are fully dissolved, add the cold water. Allow the mixture to sit for ten minutes to come to room temperature.\nAt room temperature, mix in the apples, celery, and walnuts. Pour gelatin mixture into a decorative mold or serving bowl and refrigerate overnight to set.",
