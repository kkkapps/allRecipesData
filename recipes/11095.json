    "ins": "Cream together shortening and sugar.  Mix in molasses and egg.  Stir in sifted flour, salt, soda, cinnamon, clove, and ginger.  Dough will be soft and a little sticky.\nMold into walnut-sized balls, and roll in sugar.  Place on greased cookie sheets.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 7 to 8 minutes.  Baking them longer will make them less soft, but still chewy.",
