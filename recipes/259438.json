    "des": "\"Fancy dessert for special occasions. Even though this is a fancy dessert, it is fairly easy to make. It gets a lot of praise at parties. You can serve this with whipped cream or ice cream, warm or cold, but it is a little better at least slightly warm. Use your favorite preserves for the filling.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out pie crust onto a baking sheet.\nWhisk almond paste, egg, and salt together in a bowl until blended. Spread over pie crust, leaving space on the perimeter to fold crust.\nMix pears and lemon juice in a bowl. Arrange in a decorative pattern on top of almond mixture. Fold outer edges of crust over pears.\nBake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, 30 to 50 minutes.\nPlace almonds in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes. Add preserves; cook and stir until saucy, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over the tart.",
