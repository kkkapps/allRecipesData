    "des": "\"A really cute gift that can be modified for any occasion when cute marshmallows are available. Recipe makes a yummy s'mores bar. The candy and marshmallows stay pretty-looking in jar because graham crumb mixture is put in a bag before layering in jar. Add ribbon or fabric as desired.\"",
    "ins": "Place graham cracker crumbs in a bowl. Add brown sugar; mix crumb mixture well.\nPour milk chocolate pieces into bottom of 1-quart jar. Layer marshmallows on top of chocolate.\nFit a resealable plastic bag into the jar over the marshmallows, with the opening pulled over the mouth of the jar. Spoon crumb mixture into the bag gradually, patting mixture down to fill the bag tightly. Seal the bag and close the jar.",
