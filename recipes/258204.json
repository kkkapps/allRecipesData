    "ins": "Combine peaches and water in a nonreactive 3-quart pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until peaches are soft and have colored the liquid, 20 to 25 minutes. Strain peaches and their juice through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl. Let peaches stand, occasionally giving them a gentle press with the back of a spoon, 5 minutes. Discard peach solids.\nReturn strained juice to pot. Stir in honey to taste. Bring to a boil. Skim off and discard any foam that appears on top. Taste and add lemon juice to adjust sweetness. Pour hot syrup into clean half-pint jars or bottles, leaving 1/2 inch headspace and using wide-mouth jars if freezing. Wipe rims clean with a damp paper towel.\nLet cool completely (about 1 hour). Apply clean lids. Store in fridge up to 3 weeks or in freezer up to 6 months.",
