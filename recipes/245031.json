    "des": "\"This coarse-grind honey mustard (with a surprise ingredient!)  can be added to a glaze for a ham, spooned into a green bean casserole, slathered on a turkey sandwich, or tucked into a gift basket with pretzels or cheese and crackers.\"",
    "ins": "Wash 4 (3 ounce) jars in soap and hot water; dry well.\nPulse yellow and brown mustard seeds a few times in a spice grinder to crack the seeds. (Alternatively, use a blender, rolling pin, mortar and pestle or a small food processor. The key is to crack the seeds to release the flavor.)\nStir together cracked seeds, mustard powder, Dr Pepper(R), honey, salt, thyme, and turmeric (if using) in a bowl. Cover loosely and set aside for 10 minutes for a very spicy mustard or up to 1 hour for a more mellow mustard.\nAdd vinegar, stirring thoroughly. If a smoother consistency is more to your liking, puree the paste and vinegar in a blender until smooth. (The mustard will thicken as it sits; don't worry if it seems loose.) Divide equally among prepared jars, allowing 1/2- to 3/4-inch of headspace in each jar.\nCover the jars and let stand at room temperature for 2 days before using. This curing period removes any remaining bitterness, smoothing the edges. Mustard can be stored without refrigeration for months. If it dries out, add liquid (such as water, wine, or beer), a few drops at a time, and stir to reconstitute.",
