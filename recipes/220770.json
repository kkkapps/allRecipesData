    "des": "\"Easter Ham with a chipotle/pineapple/bourbon mixture that's to die for! Don't want to take credit for it though, it's a mixture of a couple recipes that I found.\"",
    "ins": "Place chipotle peppers, brown sugar, pineapple, nutmeg, ginger, and bourbon whiskey in a blender and blend until smooth.\nUse a sharp knife to make diagonal cuts in the ham about 1 inch apart and 1/2 inch deep in a diamond pattern. Place smoked ham in a large bowl; pour the chipotle marinade over the ham and refrigerate ham in marinade for 3 to 6 hours, turning ham occasionally in the marinade to flavor all sides.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRemove ham from marinade, reserving the marinade; place ham into a roasting pan.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.\nBring the marinade to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth; whisk the mixture into the hot marinade. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.\nAfter ham has baked for 30 minutes, spoon the hot marinade over the ham.\nReturn ham to oven and continue baking until glaze is baked onto the ham and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the ham, not touching bone, reads at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 1 1/2 more hours. Baste ham with the glaze every 30 minutes.",
