In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the orange juice concentrate, then the egg, and almond extract. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the flour coated fruit and the walnuts.\nSpread the batter evenly in the prepared 9x9 inch pan. Bake for 20 minutes, or until bars start to pull away from the sides of the pan. Remove from the oven and cool before frosting.\nTo make the frosting, combine the confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons of butter, and orange juice in a small bowl. Beat until light and fluffy. Spread over cooled bars , then cut into squares.",
