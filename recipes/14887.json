    "des": "\"A twist of lemon is a strip of lemon rind (it will usually curl when cut off of the lemon). The bartender will usually run the moist part of the lemon rind over the rim of the glass, then drape the rind over the rim so that part of the rind falls in the drink. A Highball glass is a tall glass, if you do not have a Highball glass, any tall glass will do.\"",
