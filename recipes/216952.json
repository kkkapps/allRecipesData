    "des": "\"Another version of chocolate trifle recipe with coffee liqueur added to the brownies for a different rich flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nMix the brownie mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a mixing bowl until smooth, and pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the brownies shows moist crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes. Set the brownies aside, and cool completely. Use a chopstick or the end of a wooden spoon to poke holes all over the brownies, about 1/2-inch apart; drizzle the coffee liqueur all over the brownies. Let the brownies stand 5 minutes to soak up the liqueur.\nIn a bowl, whisk the chocolate pudding mix with cold milk until thickened, about 2 minutes; allow to stand 5 more minutes to set.\nTo assemble dessert, cut the brownies up into small cubes. Layer 1/3 of the brownies into the bottom of a glass trifle bowl, and top with a layer of pudding, then a layer of whipped topping. Repeat twice more, ending with whipped topping. Chill at least 4 hours before serving.",
