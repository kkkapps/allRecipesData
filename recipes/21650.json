Shake the pans gently to settle the batter, then bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the cheesecakes, but do not turn off the oven. Allow cheesecakes to cool 20 minutes before topping.\nFor the sour cream topping: Whisk together the sour cream, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla until blended.
