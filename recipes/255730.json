    "des": "\"This modified version of potato soup is completely vegan and no one can tell a bit of difference. Even picky kids love this hearty recipe, perfect for cold weather or cravings for comfort food. Top with sour cream, Cheddar cheese, green onions (or even bacon, for the meat-eaters out there), or just eat it right out of the pot. Either way, it's delicious.\"",

Add potatoes and bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.\nMix 4 cups soy milk and instant potatoes into soup until dissolved.\nStir remaining 1/2 cup soy milk and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; add to the soup, stirring well. Cook soup until heated through, stirring regularly, 5 to 10 minutes.",
