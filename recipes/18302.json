    "des": "\"This is a crisp lettuce salad with a zippy sweet and sour dressing.  Always a hit at a gathering, but doesn't store well. Very quick to prepare at the last minute.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and poppy seeds, and set aside.  Wash lettuce and tear into bite-sized pieces.  To a large bowl, first add the lettuce, then the onions, water chestnuts, and chicken.  Just before serving, top with the almonds, noodles and dressing, and toss lightly.",
