    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the almonds, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 egg and egg whites. Spread evenly in the bottom of a 9x11 inch baking dish.\nBake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is dry.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together 6 eggs, 3 cups sugar, potato starch and lemon juice until well blended and smooth. Pour over the crust, and return to the oven.\nBake for 30 minutes, or until the center of the bars no longer appears liquid. Cool over a wire rack, and cut into bars while still warm. The lemon topping will now be on the bottom, so invert the pan onto a plate to remove bars, and serve.",
