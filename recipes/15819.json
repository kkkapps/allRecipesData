    "des": "\"This is a great recipe for having a guest over. Very inexpensive, and makes a gravy that is great to eat over rice. Note: This dish is best if cooked in a wok! Serve over hot cooked white rice, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet or wok heat oil over medium heat. Add chicken and saute for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cooked through (juices run clear and chicken meat is no longer pink inside).\nAdd green bell pepper, red bell pepper, lemon pepper seasoning, prepared gravy, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir all together; reduce heat to medium low and let all simmer about 10 minutes, or until bell peppers are tender and gravy has thickened.",
