Stir coconut milk into the cocoa mixture. Sprinkle gelatin over the cocoa mixture and leave undisturbed 1 to 2 minutes.\nPlace saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir gelatin into the cocoa mixture. Add sugar; stir to dissolve sugar into the mixture. Drop yellow food coloring into the mixture. Remove saucepan from heat and cool mixture slightly.\nPour cocoa mixture into the apple shells. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.\nCut each apple half into 4 wedges; serve immediately.",
