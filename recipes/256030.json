    "des": "\"A healthy twist on an old favorite; a bit tart. We have so many wild blackberries in our neck of the woods, hence this recipe and lots of jams get made this time of year. This cobbler is delicious warm with some soy milk creamer, or fat-free non-dairy topping.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.\nMix blackberries, 1/4 cup coconut sugar, and 2 tablespoons gluten-free flour together in a bowl until blackberries are coated; pour into the prepared dish.\nMix 1 cup gluten-free flour, 1 cup coconut sugar, buttermilk, coconut flour, butter, baking powder, xanthan gum, sea salt, vanilla extract, and nutmeg together in a bowl; spread over blackberry mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until set and golden, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.",
