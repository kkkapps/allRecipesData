Pour into a small container and cool in refrigerator 1 to 2 hours.\nAgain preheat outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRub the porterhouse steaks thoroughly with the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Stir the rosemary, salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a bowl; rub evenly onto both sides of the steaks.\nCook the steaks until they are beginning to firm, and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Top with the papaya butter to serve.",
