    "des": "\"My family loves biscotti, so I brought together peanut butter chips and chocolate chips to make another flavor for our biscotti jar.  Hubby claims that these are amazing, hence the name Amazing Peanut Butter Cup Biscotti.  Wrapped in cellophane bags, they are perfect for bake sales.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLine 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nMix the milk and vanilla extract together in a small bowl; set aside.\nCombine the flour and baking powder in a separate bowl.\nBeat the peanut butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.\nAdd the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the peanut butter mixture before adding the next.\nPour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated.\nFold in the peanut butter chips; mixing just enough to evenly combine.\nDivide the dough into 4 equal parts.\nRoll each section into a 4x5-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick.\nTransfer the dough pieces onto the prepared baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until firm to the touch, about 25 minutes.\nPlace biscotti loaves on wire racks to cool.\nReduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nCut each loaf into 1/2-inch slices.\nReturn the slices to the baking sheets with the cut sides up.\nBake in the oven until biscotti are dry, about 10 minutes on each side.\nCool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.\nMelt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until melted and smooth, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).\nDip the cooled biscotti into the melted chocolate. Set the biscotti onto parchment paper, and allow to set, about 20 minutes.",
