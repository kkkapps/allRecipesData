    "des": "\"I loved peanut butter brownies as a kid but my adult taste buds now find the available recipes overly sweet with a mild peanut flavor. This updated recipe relies on powdered peanuts to boost peanut flavor. I've reduced the sugar by about 1/3 from the typical recipes. This recipe reflects the best of three alternate variations that I attempted.\"",
