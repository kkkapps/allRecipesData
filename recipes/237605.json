    "des": "\"This is a tastier version of Tater Tot\u00c2\u00ae casserole with hearty ingredients for a full meal. Made with Owens\u00c2\u00ae Original Breakfast Sausage, Ro*Tel\u00c2\u00ae Diced Tomatoes, frozen broccoli cuts and Ore-Ida\u00c2\u00ae Tater Tots\u00c2\u00ae. I like it because it is easier than shepherd's pie. My friends and their pre-teen kids love it too. Spread more cheese over potatoes before baking if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMix tomatoes with green chile peppers, broccoli, Mexican cheese blend, and cream of celery soup into sausage mixture; spread into the prepared baking dish. Arrange potato nuggets over sausage mixture; season with pepper.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and potato nuggets are slightly brown, about 45 minutes.",
