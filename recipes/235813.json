    "des": "\"After trying a few recipes for eggnog pie, I couldn't find one that was eggnoggy enough. After playing around and making a lot of pretty good pies that weren't what I was looking for, I got the results I liked. I don't know a lot of technical terms.\n\n This pie has about the same texture as pumpkin pie and actually tastes like eggnog.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and cut excess crust from edges; fill with rice or pie weights.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.\nBeat eggnog, sugar, cornstarch, eggs, egg whites, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth; pour into crust.\nBake until pie is set in the middle, 50 to 60 minutes.",
