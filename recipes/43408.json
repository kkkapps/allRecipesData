    "des": "\"This stuffing is great for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. It has a wonderful light and fruity taste. Since most of my family has been vegetarian for 25 years, we make this stuffing in a casserole instead of stuffing it in the turkey. You can, however, stuff the turkey with it and it is just as good!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large casserole dish.\nIn a large bowl, mix the bread cubes, cranberry sauce, apples, raisins, lemon zest, and orange zest. Season with salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, cider, and butter. Toss the egg mixture with the bread mixture until evenly moist. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.\nBake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.",
