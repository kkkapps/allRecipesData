    "des": "\"My parents are Ukrainian and this is a recipe we always made when I was growing up. These cabbage rolls have no meat in them.  Sometimes they used salt pork in them, but I didn't care for it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.\nSteam the whole head of cabbage until it is al dente.  Meanwhile, in a saucepan bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.\nMelt butter in a small skillet over medium heat.  Saute onion until translucent; stir into cooked rice.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nCut the leaves off of the cabbage and cut the larger leaves in half.  Spoon 1 tablespoon of rice into a leaf and roll tightly.  Place rolls in prepared casserole dish, stacking in layers.  Pour tomato juice over the rolls, using enough just to cover.\nCover and bake in preheated oven for 2 hours.",
