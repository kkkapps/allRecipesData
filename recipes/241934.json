    "des": "\"I took my basic chocolate chip cookie recipe and packed it with super foods. You get vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants with the cocoa nibs and walnuts. Fiber, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids with the flax and chia seeds, and healthy MCT fats in the coconut oil. These cookies are an easy way to treat your kids (or yourself!) with a great tasting dessert that provides nutrition and still satisfies your sweet tooth.\"",
