    "des": "\"I'm not a big fan of turkey burgers, but finding ground turkey on sale and some on-hand ingredients inspired this recipe. Most of the ingredients can be substituted or exchanged based on taste. Don't let the few ingredients in the burger itself fool you....it's got lots of flavor for a turkey burger. Feel free to add 8 oz. or more sliced mushrooms to the onions when cooking, if you happen to be a mushroom lover. This is great with sweet potato fries and/or a spinach salad. Serve with additional thousand island dressing for dipping.\"",
    "ins": "Combine ground turkey, garlic, thousand island dressing, and 1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs in a bowl. Do not overwork the mixture. Form into 4 patties; transfer to plate. Sprinkle with garlic salt and additional 1/4 cup bread crumbs; press crumbs into patties to adhere.\nHeat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in oil until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes per side. Transfer to plate; top each patty with a slice of mozzarella cheese.\nCook and stir onion rings in same skillet until tender, about 10 minutes, adding oil if necessary. Sprinkle with ground black pepper.\nHeat a non-stick griddle to medium heat.  Lightly butter bread slices on both sides; cook on each side until browned, about 2 minutes per side.\nTo assemble burgers, layer turkey and cheese patties, sauerkraut, and cooked onions between bread slices.",
