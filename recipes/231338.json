    "des": "\"Golden brown, slightly sweet cornbread waffles perfectly complement the rich, smoky flavor of beef brisket chili. Serve chili on top of cornbread waffles; top with shredded cheddar cheese and chopped onions. I use fat-free cheese and also some sour cream on mine. This stuff is seriously delicious, so make sure to buy two boxes of cornbread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a heavy 6-quart pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion until soft and pale gold in color, about 15 minutes. Stir chili powder, cocoa, garlic, oregano, cumin, kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into onion. Cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.\nStir tomatoes and beer into the mixture until well-combined. Add ranch-style beans, beef brisket, and beef broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer chili, stirring occasionally, until meat is very tender and flavors have blended, about 30 minutes. Season with liquid smoke flavoring, salt, and black pepper.\nPreheat a waffle iron on medium according to manufacturer's instructions.\nWhisk corn bread mix, egg, sour cream, and milk in a bowl to make a batter. Pour about 1/2 cup batter, or as needed, onto hot waffle iron, close lid, and bake waffle until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve chili over hot waffles.",
