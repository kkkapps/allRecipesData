    "des": "\"This homemade ice cream recipe uses fresh pears combined with sweet gooey caramel for a unique and delicious flavor. It is perfect in late summer, and it can use pears that are a bit overripe.  \nYou'll get the best results if you start a few days ahead, giving adequate time for chilling and freezing.\"",
