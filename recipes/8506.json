Place chicken on top of spinach. Pour soup mixture over top of chicken so that all is covered, then sprinkle with paprika. Spread cheese over top.\nBake for approximately 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, until cheese is lightly brown. (You can cover the dish with a piece of foil and leave it in the oven on warm until ready to serve, or it can be made the day before and reheated!)",
