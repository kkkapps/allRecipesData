Add the mushrooms, tomatoes, salt, and 1/2 tablespoon lime juice and cook until the tomatoes are soft, 3 to 5 minutes; set aside.\nBring a pot of water to a boil; add the carrots and cook until fork tender, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and set aside.\nHeat another 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large saucepan, cook the other clove of garlic in the hot oil 30 to 60 seconds. Add the cumin, coriander seed, and turmeric; cook another 1 to 2 minutes, allowing the spices to slightly burn on the bottom of the pan. Stir in the jalapeno pepper, 2 chopped green onions, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 tablespoon lime juice and the tomato mixture in with the spice mixture, scraping the bottom of the pan with a spatula to loosen the spices. Whisk in the coconut milk; simmer 6 minutes.\nAdd the cooked shrimp, carrots, and peas to the soup and stir; simmer until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Submerge the vermicelli pasta in the soup and allow to cook until the pasta is softened, 5 to 7 minutes more. Garnish with chopped cilantro.",
