    "des": "\"A sweet and sour version of barbeque sauce for shrimp, pork, and chicken. This sauce is very potent, so use sparingly as a baste while cooking shrimp, pork, and chicken. To make into a dipping barbeque sauce increase the amount of brown sugar to 1 cup and use white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar.\"",
