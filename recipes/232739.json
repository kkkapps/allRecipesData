    "des": "\"JW and I decided to make 2010 'the summer of ginger and lime.' We used a ton of fresh ginger and limes from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and by far, this was our favorite creation. Grill it or broil it. Either way, this salmon is fantastic! We serve this with a tossed green salad and steamed jasmine rice.\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 to 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler; if broiler setting has Low setting, set broiler to that. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nPlace salmon, skin side down, on the prepared baking sheet; rub salmon with olive oil. Season with seafood seasoning and black pepper. Arrange ginger slices atop salmon and sprinkle with garlic. Place lime slices over ginger-garlic layer.\nBroil salmon until hot and beginning to turn opaque, about 10 minutes; watch carefully. If broiler has a High setting, turn broiler to that setting and continue broiling until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 more minutes.",
