    "des": "\"Bell peppers stuffed with hashbrowns, ground beef, green beans, and cheese.  My apartment-mate and I invented this recipe while drinking beer and 'reminiscing' about elementary-school cafeteria food.  When we got around to trying it out, we were pleasantly surprised.  Beats your old school cook's tater tot hot dish!\"",
