    "des": "\"A spicy chicken dish with a tomatillo sauce, best served over rice and accompanied with beans (black, red, or pinto are probably best). To increase the heat of the dish, you can always add more chiles - perhaps a serrano pepper.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Roast peppers for about 25 minutes, until the skins can easily be removed. Remove skins, and chop peppers.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine chopped peppers with tomatillos, onion, red pepper, green onion, and garlic. Stir in chicken broth. Heat to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dredge chicken in flour, then saute briefly. Pour tomatillo mixture over chicken. Season with oregano, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Simmer for 25 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink. Stir in the cilantro just before serving.",
