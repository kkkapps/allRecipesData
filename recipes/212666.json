    "des": "\"My husband told me his grandmother made something similar to this, so I made up a recipe and it turned out delicious! Now it is a favorite at holiday meals and whenever we can find ducks. Makes enough for 1 or 2 ducks. If you want, marinate the duck the night before in the mixture. It makes it a little more tender.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the orange soda, orange juice concentrate, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, and teriyaki sauce into a bowl, and stir to combine and dissolve the sugar.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove any excess pieces of fat from inside the duckling, place the duck into a roasting pan, and prick the skin all over with a fork to allow the fat to drain off while roasting.\nBrush the duckling  with the orange mixture. Place the mushrooms into the cavity of the duck, and spoon in some of the orange sauce.\nRoast the duck in the preheated oven, brushing it every 20 to 30 minutes with the orange sauce, until a meat thermometer inserted into a thick part of a thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 2 1/2 hours.",
