    "des": "\"I just love my cast iron pan for many of my recipes. We were invited to our friends for dinner, and since it was on my stove top, I decided to make a dessert! Plus it looks great to bring the pan with the dessert in it to a friends house. My pan is a 12-inch so I made a really big cookie. We just warmed it in the oven while we were eating, then topped it with ice cream and melted chocolate. Yum!\"",

Add coconut sugar; mix together with a fork until well incorporated. Pour in almond flour, tapioca flour, baking soda, and sea salt; stir, first with a fork then switch to a wooden spoon, until combined.\nWhisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a bowl until evenly blended.
