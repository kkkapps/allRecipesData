    "des": "\"A delicious twist on a quick and easy Italian classic that substitutes fish sauce for finicky anchovy fillets. Serve with a generous green salad. I like something with strawberries or Asian pears and a glass of white wine. Make it a full meal by topping with a dry-spiced chicken breast (I like a hint of fish oil and garlic spice blends to make a nice rub.)\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir fish sauce, chile paste, and garlic in the hot oil; cook and stir until the garlic softens, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper, olives, capers, and oregano; continue cooking and stirring until the garlic browns, about 5 minutes more. Pour drained linguine into the sauce; toss to coat. Top with black pepper.",
