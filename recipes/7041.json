    "des": "\"A delicious dinner roll that is made from beer, honey, and a slight pinch of cinnamon.  Excellent with turkey, roasts etc.  Different beer may be substituted, but be advised that a highly hopped beer will create an astringent bitter taste. The unique taste comes from the malt used in making the beer.\"",
    "ins": "Allow 10 to 12 ounces of beer to reach room temperature and go flat.  This will take approximately 3 to 4 hours.\nCombine flattened beer, butter, cinnamon, salt, and honey in the pan of bread machine. Add flour and yeast being careful that the yeast does not  touch the liquid. Select Dough setting, and Start.\nAfter the dough has risen, remove the dough from the pan.
