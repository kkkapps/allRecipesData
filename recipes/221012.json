    "des": "\"Perfect for the person who loves egg salad but doesn't love the mayo that most recipes call for. Very fresh tasting. Fewer ingredients make this a quick and easy meal. If you have fifteen minutes and hungry kids, this is the best recipe for egg salad sandwiches. Bon appetite.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Boil for 10 minutes, then transfer eggs to a bowl of warm water. Allow eggs to rest in the warm water for 10 more minutes.\nPeel and rinse eggs under cold water to cool; cube eggs.\nMash eggs, avocado, celery, and mustard in a bowl with a fork until well mixed but still chunky. Season with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.",
