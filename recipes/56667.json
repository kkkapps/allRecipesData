    "des": "\"I got this recipe for beef soup while in Karaganda, Kazakhstan to adopt our little girl.  It's good day one, but even better the second day.  My husband loves it with brown bread.\"",
    "ins": "Place soup bones in a stock pot with enough water to cover them by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, and cook uncovered for about 1 hour to make a beef stock. Remove bones, and cool.\nHeat one tablespoon of oil in a large skillet. Saute sauerkraut for a few minutes, then add just enough water to cover the sauerkraut, cover the pan, and let simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes, until the sour taste is gone. Drain, and set aside. Heat remaining olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in the hot oil until tender.\nWhen the bones are out of the stock, add potatoes, and boil for about 15 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Stir in the sauerkraut, onions, and any meat that can be picked from the bones. Season with chili sauce and salt to taste. Simmer over low heat for about 15 minutes. Ladle into bowls, and serve with a dollop of sour cream.",
