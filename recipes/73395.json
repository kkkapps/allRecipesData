    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Split the rolls in half lengthwise, and spread butter on the insides of the bread, reserving any leftover butter.\nPlace the rolls butter side down in the pan, and place a saucer or plate on top of the rolls to act as a press. Apply just a little pressure so the bread is not flattened. Cook until golden. Pay attention, they can cook very fast. Spread any remaining butter onto the rolls as soon as they are done.",
