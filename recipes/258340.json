    "des": "\"Succulent duck breasts, butter, apples and calvados - just four ingredients make up this fabulous dish. I just made this recipe tonight and it was so good... I had my husband's seal of approval who could not wait to eat it while I was taking the picture. The sweet and sour taste is very nice. I think I'll do it again for Christmas.\"",
