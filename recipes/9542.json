    "des": "\"A Divinity recipe without egg whites which is very easy to make. Also, there is no thermometer required! Sometimes the dry frosting mix is hard to find but it is available in many groceries.\"",
    "ins": "Line a 10x15 inch cookie sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Set aside.\nBeat frosting mix, corn syrup, vanilla, and boiling water in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Mixture will be very thick, and it is helpful to use a stand mixer.\nTransfer to a large bowl and gradually beat in sugar; stir in nuts. Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls onto lined pan.  Let stand about 4 hours or until firm.  Turn candies over and dry at least 12 hours.  Store in an airtight container.",
