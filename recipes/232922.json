    "des": "\"A buttery white cake that comes together in minutes but tastes like you spent all day making it. Adding apples and cinnamon with brown sugar in layers makes this cake into an autumn delight. A scoop of ice cream is especially good with this cake.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.\nMix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl.\nBeat white sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until incorporated; add vanilla extract.\nCombine flour and baking powder together in a bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture. Mix milk into batter until smooth. Pour half the batter into the prepared loaf pan; add half the apples and half the brown sugar mixture. Lightly pat apple mixture into batter. Pour the remaining batter over apple layer; top with remaining apples and brown sugar mixture. Lightly pat apples into batter; swirl brown sugar mixture through apples using a finger or spoon.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.",
