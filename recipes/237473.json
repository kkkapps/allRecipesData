    "des": "\"You're going to love this quick-cured salmon technique. While the process is incredibly simple, the potential variations are endless. Whether you're talking about the brine or post-cure seasonings, this is something that begs for adaptation. Smoked salt, chipotle, or smoked paprika could be used before or after the cure to make things a little loxier, and don't even get me started on the herbs. After the 3-minute cure, you can sprinkle your slices with dill, tarragon, chervil, and/or thyme.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk water, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl until sugar and salt are completely dissolved.\nCut salmon along one side of the center connective tissue to the skin but not through. Turn the knife parallel to the cutting board and cut salmon meat from skin. Repeat for remaining side and discard skin and connective tissue. Cut each fillet into 1/4-inch slices.\nWorking in batches of 5, place slices in brine for 3 minutes. Remove cured slices using a slotted spoon to a wire rack and blot gently with paper towels. Arrange salmon in a single layer on a platter, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, 2 hours to overnight.",
