    "des": "\"This recipe is similar to an appetizer served at my favorite Italian restaurant. It is a nice change from the usual appetizers and always gets rave reviews! I have used tenderloin in the past, but have found that a good quality top sirloin works very well and is less expensive. Bernaise sauce is a good alternative if you don't like blue cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Season sirloin with blackened seasoning to coat on all sides.\nHeat oil in a cast-iron skillet on an outdoor grill until the oil is smoking. Cook steak bites in hot oil in small batches, reheating oil between batches, until slightly crusty, 1 to 2 minutes per side.\nStir cream cheese and evaporated milk together in a saucepan over low heat to melt the cream cheese. Whisk blue cheese crumbles, garlic powder, white pepper, and cayenne pepper into the cream cheese mixture; simmer, stirring frequently, until the blue cheese melts into a smooth sauce, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve blue cheese sauce with the beef bites.",
