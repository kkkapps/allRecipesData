    "des": "\"This recipe was born out of necessity to use up the leftover nuts and dried fruits in my pantry. The crisp of the cookie is satisfying and goes well with a nice cup of tea at the end of a long day. I have used the end of a bag of trail mix to make them before and it worked out perfectly. Experiment and add whatever you like!\"",
