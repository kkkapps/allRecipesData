    "des": "\"I know there are a lot of variations for this kind of cake, but I experimented a little and found a recipe that my family really likes. I hope yours does too. It's flavorful without being overpowering like some other recipes I've tried like this. It doesn't last long in our house!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray, or butter the pan well and coat inside with flour to prevent sticking.\nBeat the cake mix, water, eggs, vegetable oil, 1 package of coconut cream pudding mix, and 1 tablespoon of rum extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in the crushed pineapple. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cake has risen, turned golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cake to room temperature in the pan on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.\nWhile the cake is baking, spread 2 tablespoons of flaked coconut onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Remove the coconut, allow to cool, and set aside.\nTo make frosting, whisk 1 package coconut cream pudding mix with milk until the mixture turns thick and creamy, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in the whipped topping, 1/4 cup flaked coconut, coconut extract, and 1 teaspoon of rum extract. Frost the cake, and sprinkle toasted coconut on top. Keep refrigerated.",
