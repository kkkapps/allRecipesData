    "des": "\"My step-daughters always refused to eat venison, so we had to come up with creative ways to disguise it.  This very tender and savory slow cooker pot roast always had them coming back for more. It wasn't until years later we revealed the truth of the roast's origins! Serve roast, vegetables and gravy over mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Arrange the onions, carrots, and mushrooms in the bottom of a slow cooker. Rub the venison rump roast with garlic, black pepper, and salt, then place on top of the vegetables. Mix the cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, water, and onion gravy mix in a bowl until gravy mix is dissolved; pour soup mixture over the roast.\nCook on High setting until roast is very tender, 8 to 10 hours. Slice roast before serving with gravy and vegetables.",
