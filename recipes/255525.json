    "des": "\"Queso blanco is a soft, unaged white cheese that originated in Spain. It's also fantastically easy to make at home! Add salt for a savory cheese to crumble on salads, or skip the salt for a creamy soft cheese that is delicious served with a drizzle of honey! Store queso in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\"",
    "ins": "Line a colander with a damp piece of muslin or cheesecloth. Place colander over a bowl or in the sink.\nPour milk into a large saucepan; bring to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C), stirring frequently. Stir in salt.\nPour vinegar into milk, a little at a time, stirring well after each addition until curds begin to separate from the whey.\nSpoon curds into the muslin-lined colander using a slotted spoon. Fold the muslin over the top of the curds. Fill a smaller container with water and place on top of the muslin to press down on the cheese. Let rest for 1 to 3 hours, allowing the liquid to drain from the cheese (the longer you allow the cheese to drain, the drier the cheese will be).",
