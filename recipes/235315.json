    "des": "\"Paleo oatmeal has no grains in it, but mimics the texture of oatmeal and tastes somewhat the same, but even better. This healthy alternative to oatmeal is great for anyone on a paleo diet or for people who can't process gluten. We double this recipe, place it in a 1/2-gallon Mason jar, and vacuum seal it. It will make 2 to 3 days of breakfast for 2 people.\"",
