    "des": "\"This is the 'easy' version of the classic Greek dish macaronatha, which is octopus meat in a delicious tomato-based sauce over macaroni, topped with grated sheep's milk cheese. Squid is easier to obtain, and is usually sold already cleaned, thus the ease. Goes well with a fruity blush wine like white Zinfandel. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nIn a small sauce pan, boil the squid in 3 cups of water mixed with the red wine vinegar for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, cut into bite-sized rings/pieces, and set aside.\nHeat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Saute the onion and garlic until onion is tender, but not brown. Stir in the squid, and saute for 2 minutes. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, white wine and lemon juice. Season with cinnamon stick, bay leaves, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes partially covered, stirring occasionally.\nRemove from heat, and mix in cooked pasta. Serve topped with grated cheese.",
