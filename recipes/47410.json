    "des": "\"Crunchy catfish nuggets that can be served as hors d'oeuvres. These were a special hit with my 3 year old who loved the fact that she could eat them like finger food. You may want to adjust the seasoning - my daughter is used to spicy stuff! These have the great taste of fried fish without the grease.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, mix dry bread crumbs and lemon pepper. Place egg substitute in a separate small bowl. Dip catfish pieces in the egg substitute, then into the bread crumb mixture to coat.\nHeat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place coated catfish pieces in the hot oil. Fry on both sides until lightly browned and fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.",
