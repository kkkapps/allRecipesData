    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles for 5 to 8 minutes, or until just slightly underdone; drain and rinse.\nIn a large mixing bowl, mix together grated cheese, ricotta cheese, tofu,  frozen spinach, and 1 cup Parmesan cheese.\nLay out a noodle. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture on the noodle, then add a thin layer of sauce.  Roll the noodle up, and place seam side down in a 13x9 pan.  Repeat for other noodles.  Top with remaining sauce and Parmesan cheese.\nBake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven  for 30 min, or until hot and bubbly.",
