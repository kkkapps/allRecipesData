    "des": "\"This dish goes together quickly and is a favorite with kids. I like to serve it with  angel hair pasta tossed with butter and a salad. On nights that I don't have time to marinate the chicken, I just coat it with the dressing.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the chicken breasts and Italian dressing in a zip-top bag. Seal bag, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nRemove chicken from marinade and place in a baking dish. Discard used marinade. Layer pepperoni slices evenly over chicken. Cover dish with foil, and bake in the preheated oven until the juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chicken breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nRemove chicken from the oven, uncover, and top each chicken breast with a slice of provolone cheese. Return to oven and bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5 minutes.",
