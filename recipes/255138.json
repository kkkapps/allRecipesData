    "des": "\"My husband taught me this traditional Egyptian recipe. He says I make it better than his mom did! The trick is knowing exactly when to add the water, giving the chicken enough time to fry a little, but not letting it burn. Serve with rice and stewed vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Rub chicken with salt and pepper.\nCombine chicken, giblets, and butter in a 5-quart pot over medium heat. Add onion, cloves, cardamom, and bay leaf. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated. Cook chicken until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPour in enough water to just cover the chicken. Simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.",
