    "des": "\"I really wanted my husband to try goat cheese, so the other night I asked him if he wanted scalloped potatoes in a cheese sauce; he said 'yes,' and this is what I made. Afterwards he said I would definitely need to make this again, as he had four helpings. When I told him that it was goat cheese all he could say was 'REALLY?' and kept eating. I would say this was a winner; how about you? Just pour finished sauce over your choice of pasta, potatoes, or whatever you like.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; add onion and season with a pinch of salt. Cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir flour with the onion; cook, stirring continually, for 1 minute.\nPour 1 cup milk into the saucepan while stirring; add goat cheese and stir to melt. Stir remaining milk into the mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, and cook until you reach your desired texture, 5 to 10 minutes more; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper.",
