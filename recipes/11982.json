    "des": "\"Pureed tofu is the secret of this delicious, creamy, tomato sauce. Rotelle works well with this recipe, but you can substitute any other pasta.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot with boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente. Drain well.\nMeanwhile, in a blender or food processor puree roasted red and yellow peppers, tofu, tomato paste, vegetable broth, balsamic vinegar, and Italian seasoning. Set aside.\nCoat a medium saute pan with cooking spray. Cook onion, garlic, and asparagus over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add water if necessary to prevent sticking. Stir in mushrooms; cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until mushrooms are tender and soft. Stir in tofu sauce, tomatoes, black pepper. Add hot chili paste, if desired. Reduce heat to low, and heat through.\nToss pasta with sauce, and serve with Parmesan cheese.",
