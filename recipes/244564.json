    "des": "\"Light and spicy, chilapachole is a seafood soup enjoyed along the Gulf of Mexico. The sweet crabmeat in a piquant tomato broth makes an elegant dinner party starter, or can be served with a few simple quesadillas for an easy dinner at home. Each coastal chef has a distinct interpretation of this dish, but the secret ingredient they all agree on is pan-roasted vegetables. Some time in a hot skillet makes all the difference- adding a deeper vegetable flavor to your chilapachole.\"",
