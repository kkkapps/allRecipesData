Have you tried my Egg Salad, Bacon Deviled Eggs, or my Roasted Buffalo Chicken Deviled Eggs? Now you can boil a few more and make this great Paleo recipe. \n\nTry Lettuce Cups with Smoked Salmon and Eggs and top with avocado or fresh herbs from your garden! I love to drizzle a little extra extra virgin olive oil. \n\nEnjoy!\"",
