Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.\nBeat the egg in a small bowl.  Temper the egg by whisking in some of the hot rice, a tablespoon at a time until you have incorporated about 6 tablespoons.  Stir the egg into the rice along with the vanilla and butter, and continue cooking over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to thicken.",
