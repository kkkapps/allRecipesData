    "des": "\"Many years ago when I moved to a high altitude area, I found that my meringues on my pies were flat and weepy, unlike those I had made at a lower altitude.  I found this recipe, and I was back to making Lemon Meringue Pies again. It adds volume and is much more stable.  Works great at any altitude.\"",
    "ins": "In a glass or ceramic bowl, stir together the cornstarch, sugar and salt. Mix in the water. Heat in the microwave until the mixture is thick and clear, about 2 minutes at full power. Set aside to cool slightly.\nBeat egg whites in a large glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually pour in the sugar mixture while continuing to whip the egg whites until thick and stiff enough to hold a peak. Cover pie filling completely with meringue, sealing to the edges. Bake as directed in the recipe, or in a preheated 450 degrees F (220 degrees C) oven until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes.",
