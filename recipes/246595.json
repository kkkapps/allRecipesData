    "ins": "Toast sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.\nCombine onion, Asian pear, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and black pepper in a blender. Puree into a smooth marinade. Add sesame seeds; blend briefly on low just to mix them in.\nSpread a thin layer of marinade in the bottom of a large container. Add a single layer of beef. Cover beef evenly with another thin layer of marinade. Repeat with remaining beef and marinade. Cover container and refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 3 hours and preferably overnight.\nHeat a large grill pan or skillet over high heat. Add all the beef and marinade; cook, stirring constantly, until most of the marinade evaporates and the beef starts to brown, 3 to 4 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into a slice should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).",
