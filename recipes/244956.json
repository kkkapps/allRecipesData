    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.\nCombine apple and cinnamon sugar in a bowl; mix until evenly coated.\nDivide crescent roll dough into 8 triangles. Spoon about 1 teaspoon apple mixture onto each triangle and top with 1/2 teaspoon caramel sauce. Roll crescent dough around the filling, bringing the ends together and squeezing to completely contain the filling. Sprinkle a little more cinnamon sugar on top of each crescent roll. Place rolls on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until crescent rolls are lightly browned, 11 to 13 minutes.",
