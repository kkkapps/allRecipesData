    "des": "\"This is one of my favorite dishes. The sake and mayo marinade makes chicken tender and juicy. It is great with steamed white rice and some simple salt and pepper saut\u00c3\u00a9ed asparagus with garlic. I sometimes use chicken tender strips to save time. You can also use shrimp instead of chicken. I understand that many of you don't have sake, but if you use white wine instead, the chicken will not the taste the same.\"",

Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 15 minutes.\nWhisk remaining 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and lemon juice together in a bowl.
