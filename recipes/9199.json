    "des": "\"This recipe makes your turkey moist and full of flavor. You can also use this recipe for Cornish game hens, chicken breasts, or roasting chicken. The size of the turkey you select should depend wholly on the amount of guests you are cooking for. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the olive oil, garlic, rosemary, basil, Italian seasoning, black pepper and salt. Set aside.\nWash the turkey, inside and out, pat dry. Remove any large fat deposits. Loosen the skin from the breast. This is done by slowly working your fingers between the breast and the skin. Work it loose to the end of the drumstick being careful not to tear the skin.\nUsing your hand, spread a generous amount of the rosemary mixture under the breast skin and down the thigh and leg. Rub the remainder of the rosemary mixture over the outside of the breast. Use toothpicks to seal skin over any exposed breast meat.\nPlace the turkey on a rack in a roasting pan. Add about 1/4 inch of water to the bottom of the pan. Roast according to the number of pounds your turkey weighs. This is usually 20 minutes per pound in a 325 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven. A meat thermometer inserted in the thigh should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) and the juices should run clear when pierced with a fork.",
