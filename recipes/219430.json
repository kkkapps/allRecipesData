    "ins": "Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the celery until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in sage and poultry seasoning. Remove from heat.\nMix chicken broth with water in a large saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium heat; stir in the margarine until melted. Lightly stir the cornbread stuffing mix into the broth mixture until the broth has absorbed; fluff the stuffing mix with a fork. Mix in enough oyster liquid to moisten the dressing, about 1/2 cup, or as desired. Gently stir in the celery with butter and seasonings from skillet, oysters, and black pepper.\nCook the dressing until hot and the flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.",
