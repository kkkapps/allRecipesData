    "des": "\"Traditional, wholesome, and all-around tasty. This recipe is about 400 years old. If the thickness is not to your liking, you can sift in flour until the desired thickness is reached. Serve hot over dumplings or whatever you feel like eating with, though dumplings are recommended. Ooh! I should put my dumpling recipe on here...maybe...\"",
