    "des": "\"Thanks to Priscilla's New England Potato Soup for the starter recipe that I tweaked. Use your imagination! Throw in what you have available! Not sure about spices, read the label on the container. If it's for soup, try it! You can easily make this vegetarian by leaving out animal-based stock and the ham. Enjoy - very delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and celery until tender, about 10 minutes. Add broth, potatoes, salt, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhisk flour and 1/2 cup milk together in a bowl until smooth; gradually stir into soup. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, until combined, 2 minutes. Stir in ham, peas, and remaining 2 cups milk; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.",
