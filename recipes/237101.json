    "des": "\"This is an old southern dish that's good for holiday gatherings and family get-togethers. I love this recipe because it has such wonderful flavors in it, and I would serve it with fried chicken and green beans with sauteed sweet peppers.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a casserole or souffle dish.\nCombine cream, butter, sugar, honey, and salt in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until butter melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly stir cornmeal into cream mixture until thickened but not boiling, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour cornmeal mixture into a large bowl.\nBeat egg yolks, 1 at a time, into cornmeal mixture, ensuring egg yolk is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir baking powder and white pepper into cornmeal-egg yolk mixture.\nBeat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Fold egg whites into cornmeal-egg yolk mixture; pour into the prepared dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and puffed, about 35 minutes.",
