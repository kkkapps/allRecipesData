    "des": "\"I changed the recipe to make these delicious burgers for more people. I caramelized the onions to give it more depth of flavor. I also added Dijon mustard and real garlic instead of garlic powder. I also cut down on the amount of bread crumbs and made them out of whole wheat to make them a little healthier. I also omitted the soy sauce for the same reason.\n They came out great. The only thing I would do different next time is to give them just a little heat. Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in the hot oil until tender and lightly browned, about 15 minutes; transfer to a large bowl.\nMix bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, poultry seasoning, ground mustard, pepper, and salt with the onion. Break the turkey into small pieces into the bowl; mix with the bread crumb mixture until evenly combined. Shape the turkey mixture into 12 patties; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 20 minutes.\nCoat a nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium heat.\nCook the patties in the hot skillet until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
