    "des": "\"Thin slices of salmon lounge in a citrus, cilantro and garlic marinade for four hours before being served with chips, rice or tortillas. Fresh ingredients are what makes this simple, easy dish amazing. The hardest part of it is the slicing and dicing. With minimal effort and no cooking you'll get rave reviews. This can just as easily pass for an appetizer in smaller portions.\"",
    "ins": "In a large glass or plastic bowl, dissolve the sugar, salt, and chili paste in the lime juice. Season with pepper and cumin. Stir in the olive oil, garlic, onion, tomato, and cilantro. Gently mix in the salmon, then cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours.\nTo serve, drain the excess liquid from the salmon, then gently stir in the avocado slices, and allow to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.",
