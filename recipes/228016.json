    "des": "\"I always hated gloppy Caesar dressings, so I came up with my own, which is very similar to the original one created in Tijuana in the 1920s. This quick and easy salad is a huge hit whenever I serve it, and it easy to prepare ahead of time. Just wait until the last minute to combine the lettuce, croutons, dressing, and cheese. The key is to use real grated Parmesan cheese, not the stuff in the can.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nArrange French bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet with a rim. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir 1 clove garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour butter mixture over bread cubes; season with salt, black pepper, and parsley. Toss to coat.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on the outside and crisp in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhisk lemon juice, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, kosher salt, anchovy paste, 1 clove garlic, and black pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in canola oil, while whisking lemon mixture with opposite hand until emulsified.\nCombine romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, and half the dressing in a bowl; toss to coat. Add croutons and remaining dressing; toss to coat.",
