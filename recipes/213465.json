    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the pork chops in the hot pan, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Pour in the apple juice and maple syrup; reduce heat and simmer until the juice has reduced and thickened slightly.\nCook until the pork is no longer pink in the center. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
