    "des": "\"This is a fantastic recipe even for non-lentil eaters. The honey gives it a sweet taste and it is perfect served with rice. It's great as a main dish but could be a side as well. This is the first of many wonderful lentil recipes i tried. I was scared of lentils but my daughter wouldn't eat meat so i had to try other things...needless to say lentils are a part of our regular diet and that is because of this great recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the lentils, bay leaf, 2 cups water, chicken broth, and salt together in a dutch oven or oven-proof saucepan; bring the mixture to a boil. Place a cover on the pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and allow the lentils to simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaf.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir the dry mustard, ginger, soy sauce, onion, and 1 cup water together in a bowl; stir the mixture into the lentils. Drizzle the honey over the mixture. Return the cover to the pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the lentils are tender, about 1 hour.",
