Remove saucepan from heat and let rest covered for 5 minutes. Remove cover and allow quinoa to cool completely.\nPut kale in a large mixing bowl.\nWhisk olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic, pepper, and salt together in a bowl until oil emulsifies into the mixture; drizzle over kale. Add cooled quinoa, pecans, currants, and feta cheese to the dressed kale and toss to incorporate.",
