    "des": "\"Fresh halibut and savory Mediterranean flavors come together to make a great dish. If you cannot find halibut, substitute sea bass, snapper, or cod.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nHeat canola oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Season halibut to taste with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour, and shake off the excess. Sear the halibut until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Pour excess oil from skillet, then place into preheated oven, and bake until flakey, 7 to 8 minutes.\nWhen cooked, remove fish from skillet, and keep warm. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the pan, stir in shallots, and cook over medium heat until they turn translucent, about 1 minute. Add the ham, drained raisins, capers, and pine nuts; continue cooking for another minute. Pour in Calvados, and cook until reduced by half. Add the chicken stock, increase heat to high, and boil until 1/4 of the stock has evaporated.\nRemove the skillet from the heat, and quickly whisk in 1/2 cup butter until dissolved. Whisk in the parsley and thyme; season to taste with salt. To serve, arrange halibut on a warmed serving platter or individual plates, pour the sauce overtop. Serve immediately.",
