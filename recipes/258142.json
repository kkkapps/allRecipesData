Sprinkle with smoked paprika.\nTo make Beer, Sausage, Cheese Sauce, cook breakfast sausage and garlic in pot.\nWhen cooked through, add butter, mustard, red pepper flakes and cheese. Stir until melted.\nOnce mixed together, add Worcestershire sauce. Let cook for 5 minutes (make sure to keep stirring, so cheese does not stick to bottom of pan). Add some more heavy cream if sauce is too thick.  Set aside.",
