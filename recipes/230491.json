    "des": "\"A rich chocolate biscotti mixed with the flavor of peppermint. These are sized just like the ones you get in the coffee shop. When wrapped in cellophane bags, they are perfect for bake sales.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nBeat white sugar, butter, and cocoa powder together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy and smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix chocolate liqueur and peppermint extract into the sugar-egg mixture.\nCombine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Slowly mix flour mixture into sugar-egg mixture until fully incorporated; fold mint chocolate chips into the dough.\nDivide dough into 4 equal parts and shape into logs. Arrange the logs on the prepared baking sheets.\nDip a spatula in water and use it to smooth surface of the logs.\nBake biscotti logs in the preheated oven until firm to the touch, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool biscotti logs completely on wire racks.\nReduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nCut biscotti logs into 3/4-inch slices and arrange on baking sheets.\nBake in the oven until biscotti are dry, about 10 minutes per side. Cool completely on wire racks.\nPlace candy melts in a wide microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, about 2 1/2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.\nDip cooled biscotti in the melted white candy; sprinkle with crushed candy canes.",
