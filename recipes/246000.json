    "des": "\"Black rice is one of the handful of superfoods. This rice is so flavorful and has a very unique presentation as it cooks up to a deep purple color. This rice goes great with just about any meal as a nice healthy side. I love to make it with salmon and a side of fresh veggies.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add black rice, onion, and almonds; cook and stir until lightly toasted, 5 to 10 minutes. Add water and bouillon cube; bring to a boil. Reduce hear to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 25 to 30 minutes.",
