    "ins": "Place potatoes into boiling water and cook about 20 to 30 minutes depending on the size until they are cooked thoroughly.\nDrain and cover to let stand until they are cool enough to handle.\nCut potatoes in half or quarter (depending on the size; smaller sizes will cook faster) and attempt to make them as uniform as possible.\nPlace in a bowl and add poultry stock and white wine, mix and let the liquid absorb into the potatoes.\nIn a separate bowl add garlic, vinegar, Dijon mustard, 1/2 the salt and pepper and mix well. Whisk in 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil into the mixture until dressing is emulsified.\nAdd vinaigrette to the potatoes and mix well.\nAdd green onions, parsley, dill, and basil and mix again.\nServe immediately or at room temperature.",
