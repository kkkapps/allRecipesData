    "des": "\"The pumpkin is a great surprise in this chili! It makes the whole house smell good and tastes great! Garnish with cheese and jalapenos if desired. This recipe can be made on stovetop too. Cooking time would be reduced to 30-45 minutes for chili to simmer.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the beef in the skillet until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the red pepper flakes, garlic, and onion; continue cooking until the beef has browned and the onion has softened and turned translucent. Add the green and red bell pepper and cook 5 minutes more.\nWhile the beef is cooking, combine the kidney beans, black beans, Great Northern beans, tomato sauce, tomato sauce with garlic and onions, petite diced tomatoes, fire roasted diced tomatoes, and pumpkin puree in a large slow cooker. Season with pumpkin pie spice, chili powder, cumin, and salt. Stir in the ground beef mixture.\nCook on Low until the chili is hot, 1 to 2 hours.",
