    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nWarm olive oil and sage in a saucepan over medium-low heat until sage flavor is infused, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.\nBrush 1 side of squash slices with sage-infused olive oil. Place oil-side down onto the preheated grill. Brush slices with additional oil. Grill until tender, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Sprinkle with salt.",
