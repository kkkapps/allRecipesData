    "des": "\"Green chile peppers, leftover cubed chicken breast, creamy soups, milk, sour cream and cheese make this a spicy, creamy casserole treat. This easy casserole is all my family requests!  It can be made more or less spicy, depending on your preference and is equally as tasty if you use all low-fat ingredients.\"",
