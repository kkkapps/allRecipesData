    "des": "\"I couldn't find a recipe with ham and white kidney beans, so I came up with this. Luckily, it came out exactly as I imagined. I simmered it all day, just because that's how I like to make my soup. But it was cooked within 30 minutes at a low boil, but had more flavor after a long simmer covered. I served with Italian 5-grain bread buttered and toasted.\"",
