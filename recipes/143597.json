    "des": "\"This Asian coleslaw is lightened up a bit by using only 3 tablespoons of olive oil and a sugar alternative like Splenda to make this kid friendly, flavorful crunchy salad.  Try it with white or balsamic vinegar, too.\"",
    "ins": "Place ramen noodles in colander; break into quarters.  Pour boiling water over noodles to soften slightly.  Use a fork to separate noodles.  Rinse quickly with cold water; drain.\nMake a dressing by whisking together the flavor packet from the ramen noodles, olive oil, vinegar, and sweetener in a bowl. Place the ramen noodles, coleslaw mix, green onions, and sunflower seeds in a large bowl; toss to combine. Drizzle dressing over the coleslaw mixture and continue to toss until entire mixture is coated with dressing. Chill for 2 hours before serving.",
