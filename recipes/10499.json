    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCream butter or margarine with mixer.  Blend in whole eggs, sugar, and extract.  Add flour, baking soda, and salt.  When the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, add oats and pecans.  Mix on lower speed until consistent.\nDrop pieces of the dough using an ice cream scoop onto an ungreased cookie tray roughly 3 to 4 inches apart.\nBake 8 to 10 minutes.  Eight minutes would yield crispy cookies with a chewy, slightly doughy center.  For harder, crispier cookies, bake longer.  Cool on wire rack.",
