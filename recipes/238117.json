    "des": "\"This is a bold, flavorful hummus with a bit of heat. The lemon juice and zest give a wonderful brightness that my children and grandchildren seem to love. The ingredients are usually available in my pantry, so I can make this at a moment's notice. This, of course, is to my taste, and I like lots of flavor, so a little goes a long way. I hope you enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Pour all garbanzo beans into the bowl of a food processor; pulse several times to slightly break some of the beans. Add garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, cumin, basil, salt, cayenne pepper, and ground black pepper; blend until the beans are beginning to look like large crumbs, about 1 minute.\nWith the food processor running, gradually stream reserved liquid from garbanzo beans, olive oil, and sesame oil into the beans mixture; continue to blend until all liquids are integrated with the garbanzo bean mixture into a smooth hummus.",
