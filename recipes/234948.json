    "des": "\"Delicious chicken nuggets with a surprisingly good crunch. Different in design, but yummily young. Perfect for small kids and great for spending time as a family making them. Serve with your favorite sauce. The chicken nuggets can be frozen after baking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour potato chips into a shallow dish. Beat egg and milk together in a separate shallow dish. Dip chicken cubes in egg mixture and press into potato chips until evenly coated; transfer coated chicken to a baking sheet. Drizzle coated chicken with melted butter.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the coating is golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.",
