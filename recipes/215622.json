Form the mixture into a loaf, and place into the center of a 9x12-inch baking dish.\nIn a bowl, mix together 1/3 cup of applesauce, the Dijon mustard, and honey into a smooth mixture, and spread the glaze over the top and sides of the meat loaf.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until the internal temperature of the loaf is 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 30 more minutes. Allow the loaf to rest for 5 minutes before serving.",
