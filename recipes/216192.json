    "des": "\"Sweet and spicy strips of pheasant. A great way to use pheasant or even duck and great on chicken too.  My kids request this recipe for their birthday dinners! We have a lot of hunters so are always needing recipes.  We've tried this with duck also and it's even good with duck (it's hard to make duck people will eat). Even people who claim to hate duck eat it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the honey and wing sauce together until smooth; set aside. Season the flour to taste with salt and pepper; whisk, and set aside.\nBeat the eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth; stir in the pheasant strips. Remove the pheasant strips from the egg, and gently press into the flour to coat; shake off the excess flour. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the pheasant strips on each side until golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes per side. toss the pheasant strips in the wing sauce, and pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the pheasant has absorbed the sauce, about 20 minutes.",
