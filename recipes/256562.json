    "des": "\"A gluten-free pie crust using common ingredients. I've adjusted the method over time and have found this final recipe to work every time. It is perfect for both sweet and savory dishes. The trick is leaving large chunks of butter, whole, so they create a flaky crust. The baked crust holds its shape quite well and delivers a nice slice of filled pie beautifully without falling apart.\"",
    "ins": "Place brown rice flour in a resealable plastic bag. Add butter to the bag one cube at a time, shaking to coat each cube evenly with flour. Seal bag and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.\nWhisk eggs and vinegar together in a small bowl. Place in the refrigerator.\nPour gluten-free flour into a large bowl. Cut in butter with your fingers until mixture resembles pebbles with some large lumps of butter remaining. Stir in egg and vinegar mixture. Mix in water one tablespoon at a time until dough is no longer sticky and forms a ball.\nWrap dough in plastic wrap; refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.\nDivide dough into 2 pieces and roll out to desired thickness on a lightly floured work surface.",
