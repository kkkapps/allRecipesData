    "des": "\"This scrumptious and hearty soup is perfect for those short on time or reluctant to tackle cumbersome fresh pumpkin and garlic prep. It makes a wonderfully satisfying and surprising meal for fall and winter dinner guests. I serve this delectable soup with crusty bread and grilled vegetables; it would also complement a roast.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream of potato soup, water, pumpkin, butter, and cream. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and ginger. Stir until blended, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes.\nRemove from heat, and pour into a tureen. Sprinkle the top with paprika, and top with seasoned croutons.",
