Let rise til double, about 50 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBrush loaves with egg wash.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Make 4 cuts about 1/4 inch deep across top of log.  Place a pan of  hot water in bottom of oven.  Bake bread for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden.   To make a nice crusty bread, bake bread in the afternoon and pop into oven again for 5 minutes before meal.  Makes a very crusty bread!  You would be surprised how much better it is if you heat it that last 5 minutes.   Try it.  I learned this in a bread machine class!",
