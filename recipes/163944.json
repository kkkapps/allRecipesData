    "des": "\"I got the idea for this dressing from my love for Post Cranberry and Almond Cereal - I thought it was a great flavor combination. I like this dressing over a mixed green salad, potato salad (yes, it actually works) and even grilled salmon or warm roast turkey breast and glazed ham steaks at Christmas. I really love the color of this dressing - whatever it touches looks so pretty.\"",
