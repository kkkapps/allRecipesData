    "des": "\"Just like a chili hotdog but with a thin hamburger patty instead! In Des Moines, IA, this is also known as Hamburger Coney Style from Jim's Coney Island.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nMix the ground beef, Worcestershire, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper. Shape into 6 thin patties. Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place the cheese slices on the burgers during the last minute of cooking.\nHeat the can of chili in a saucepan until hot. Cut the hamburger patties in half and put two halves into a hot dog bun, side by side.  Place the pickles in the buns and top with chili.",
