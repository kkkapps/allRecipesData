    "des": "\"After trying and tweaking several different pancake recipes, I'm very happy with this one. The oats add texture, the bananas make them sweet, and the almond meal adds protein and a delicate crispiness. My kids love these pancakes on a Saturday morning, and I always make sure I save some for myself! Serve warm with maple syrup.\"",

Beat milk, banana, and canola oil into the beaten egg; pour into flour mixture and stir until just combined into a lumpy batter.\nPour batter 1/2-cupful at a time onto the hot griddle; cook until edges become crisp and bubbles have formed on the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes and continue cooking until the bottom of the pancakes are browned, 3 to 5 minutes more.",
