Mix together flour, brown sugar, and white sugar, then stir into chocolate mixture. Stir in eggs and vanilla. Fold in pecans, coconut, and 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Pour into pie crust.\nBake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Top should be set, and may crack slightly, but the pie is best if under-baked.",
