Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese with the sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Spread the mixture evenly over the baked crust. Crumble the reserved cake mix mixture over the top.\nBake for an additional 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until filling is set and the topping is lightly toasted.
