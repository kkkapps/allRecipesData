    "des": "\"Forget about ripping open a bag of potato chips and make your own healthier baked potato chips on a stick. These chips have a subtle Mexican flavor, but get creative and use different seasonings that you like. Once you get used to threading the potato spirals onto skewers, these are not only fun, but easy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray.\nSlice each potato into long spirals using a spiralizer fitted with the straight-flat blade. Cut each spiral into 3 shorter pieces.\nThread a skewer through the middle of each potato spiral. Gently push down to fan out spiral.\nSet skewers on the prepared baking sheet; spray generously with cooking spray. Sprinkle taco seasoning on top.\nRoast in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 17 to 18 minutes. Season with sriracha sauce and sea salt.",
