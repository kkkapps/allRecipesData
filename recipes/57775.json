Toss with Italian dressing, and allow to marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator.\nPreheat a grill for medium heat.\nTo assemble the venison wraps, lay a strip of venison on top of a strip of bacon.  Place a teaspoon of cream cheese at one end, and top with a slice of jalapeno.  Roll up and secure with a skewer.  Repeat with remaining ingredients. Season the wraps with desired amount of seasoning salt.\nGrill for 10 minutes, then turn over, and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp.",
