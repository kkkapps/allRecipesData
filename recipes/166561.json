    "des": "\"Fried wontons filled with a mixture of whatever you have on hand are a good place to start. I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and everyone loved them! No special deep fryer is needed, your standard 10 inch frying pan will work. You can dip them in your favorite salsa or salsa and sour cream mixture for a lighter dipping sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and black beans, bring to a simmer, then stir in the tomato and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until the tomatoes are hot and beginning to soften.\nTo make the wontons: Separate and place the wonton wrappers onto your work surface. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling onto the center of each wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nFry the poppers a few at a time until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, and serve within 15 minutes.",
