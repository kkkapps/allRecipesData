    "ins": "Whisk together the vinegar, salt, garlic powder, basil, and red pepper flakes in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the pork chops and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap; marinate in the refrigerator 6 hours to overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat; lightly oil the grate.\nWhile the grill heats, combine the cherries, water, and sugar in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely, 5 to 10 minutes.\nRemove the pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess moisture. Discard the remaining marinade.\nCook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nDrizzle the chutney over the pork chops; garnish with the mint.",
