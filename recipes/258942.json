It has turned into a crowd favorite and everyone has asked me for the recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x9-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.\nCook bacon in a large skillet until almost crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir until just soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss in garlic; cook for 1 minute. Pour off and discard grease. Mix in hominy and pimentos; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add 1 1/2 cups of Cheddar cheese and salt and pepper to taste; stir until cheese is just melted, about 2 minutes. Transfer mixture to the casserole dish and top with remaining Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese is bubbly, about 20 minutes.",
