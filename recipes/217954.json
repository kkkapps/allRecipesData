    "des": "\"Delicious and so easy, it'll become a Christmas morning tradition! Needs no syrup.  Whipped cream and sliced fruit like strawberries and bananas are great on top! Instead of eggnog, you can use whole milk and add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a tablespoon of vanilla.\"",
