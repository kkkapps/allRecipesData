Cook and stir the shallots until they become translucent and tender; stir in garlic and cook until tender and aromatic.\nStir in 1 cup white wine, increase heat to high and bring to a boil.  Once it boils, add the remaining 1/2 cup wine.  Boil for 10 minutes then reduce heat to medium-low.  Season with white pepper to taste.\nWhen sauce is no longer boiling, slowly stir in cream, lemon juice and salt.  Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.",
