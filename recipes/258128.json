    "des": "\"I have young boys and they are, unfortunately, picky eaters. However, when I make this marinara sauce, and then blend it up so no veggies can be picked out, they love it. I also use this for pizza sauce, lasagna, and any recipe that calls for marinara. I hope your family enjoys as much as we do!\"",
