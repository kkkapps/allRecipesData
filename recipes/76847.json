    "des": "\"This is a very mild sauerkraut recipe. It actually doesn't taste much like sauerkraut or I wouldn't like it. It took me 2 years to finally decide to give it a try and boy was it worth it! It is low calorie with vegetables and apple - an interesting blend of flavors. Serve with baked or  mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSeason ribs with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook ribs, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides. Add wine (if using), water, caraway seeds, and brown sugar; stir to dissolve sugar. Stir in drained sauerkraut, apple, and carrots, and transfer to a large casserole dish.\nBake, covered, in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours, adding water as needed to prevent drying out.",
