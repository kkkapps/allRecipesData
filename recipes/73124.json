    "des": "\"This recipe goes together quickly and does not need a lot of time in the slow cooker.  It's a delicious way to add flavor to ground beef and the children love it! The gravy is delightful served over mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion soup mix, bread crumbs, and milk using your hands. Shape into 8 patties.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge the patties in flour just to coat, and quickly brown on both sides in the hot skillet. Place browned patties into the slow cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream of chicken soup, au jus mix, and water. Pour over the meat. Cook on the Low setting for 4 or 5 hours, until ground beef is well done.",
