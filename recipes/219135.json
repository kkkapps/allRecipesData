    "des": "\"Smooth, buttery, butterscotch concoction mean to resemble a drink you'd find in Harry Potter's magical world. It's perfect for a cool, snowy or rainy day and a great alternative to hot chocolate. You could top this with some whipped cream. Substitute butterscotch schnapps for a more adult version. You can also use soy milk in place of the milk if you prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter with the honey in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir the milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and butterscotch topping into the butter mixture; heat until just about to boil and remove from heat. Whisk the cinnamon and hot chocolate powder into the mixture; pour into a mug to serve.",
