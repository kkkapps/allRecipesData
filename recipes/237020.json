    "ins": "Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.\nSeason pork chops evenly with 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper; cook in the hot skillet until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate, retaining drippings in the skillet.\nHeat remaining teaspoon olive oil in the retained drippings; add onions and season with remaining salt. Saute onions until golden brown, about 10 minutes.\nSpread about half the cooked onions and half the sliced apricots into the bottom of a slow cooker crock. Lie pork chops atop the onion and apricots. Layer remaining onion and apricots over the pork chops; add pineapple juice, ginger, thyme, and cinnamon stick.\nCook on Low until the pork is fork-tender, 6 to 8 hours (or on High for 3 to 4 hours). Remove and discard cinnamon stick. Sprinkle cilantro over the mixture.",
