    "ins": "Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle for a 2 pound batch; press Start. The dough can be a bit sticky, so you may want to add a little bit more bread flour as it mixes.\nWhen the dough cycle is complete, turn the risen dough out on a lightly floured surface and divide into twelve equal pieces. Form the pieces into rounds and place on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until golden brown.",
