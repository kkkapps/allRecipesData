    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Place the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nAdd the chopped green onions to the bacon grease; cook and stir for about a minute or until the onions reach your desired tenderness. Pour the onions and bacon grease over the lettuce and toss lightly. Crumble the bacon and add it to the lettuce. Serve immediately.",
