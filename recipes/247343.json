    "des": "\"I was greedy and bought the big box of waffles at Costco\u00c2\u00ae. The kids got tired of them and I just had to come up with a recipe to get rid of them. What do you know, the kids ate this easy- to-make dessert in no time, and the waffles were gone! I have used homemade waffles for this recipe, which works just as well. We have tried adding fresh strawberries, chocolate chips, or raisins on top: delicious! Be creative and add your own toppings!\"",
