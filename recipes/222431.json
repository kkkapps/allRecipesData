    "des": "\"The richness of the avocado makes this dish taste amazing. Feel free to add more or less olive oil for your preferred consistency. For best results refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. Enjoy and feel guilt-free (unless you eat the whole bowl, which might just happen). It is easy to tweak this recipe to anything you like; add cooked chicken, or stir in some tuna, add some more veggies, or take some out that you don't like or have on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook corkscrew-shaped pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and cool.\nMix pasta, tomatoes, apple, carrot, celery, peas, red bell pepper, black olives, and red onion together in a large bowl.\nWhisk avocado, olive oil, lime juice, dill, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder together in a separate bowl until smooth; stir into pasta salad to coat; garnish with Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.",
