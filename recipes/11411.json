    "des": "\"My Grandma Lola used to make these cookies every time we would visit. They are even good the second day. Just pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds!!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium size mixing bowl sift together flour, baking soda, salt and baking powder.\nIn a large mixing bowl cream butter, white and brown sugars together until light and fluffy. Dribble vanilla into the creamed mixture. Beat the eggs, one at a time, into the mixture. Add the sifted ingredients to the creamed mixture. Beat until well mixed.\nPour chocolate chips, wheat germ and oats into the mixture; fold into dough until well combined. Drop the dough by rounded teaspoonful onto an ungreased cookie sheet.\nBake 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges are just slightly brown. The cookies will look undercooked but that is the correct consistency. Cool on a wire rack.",
