    "des": "\"A quick and easy recipe for delicious pickled peppers! My husband loves these, and the amount of garlic can be adjusted depending on personal taste. We use a lot because we're big fans of pickled garlic too. You could also substitute serrano peppers for the jalapenos, cauliflower for the carrots, or add small onions. Pickles will keep approximately 6 weeks in the fridge.\"",
    "ins": "Combine white vinegar and olive oil in a pot; bring to a boil. Add carrots; simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in jalapenos, garlic, peppercorns, coriander, salt, mustard seeds, and thyme; simmer until jalapenos soften, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPour the jalapeno mixture into 2 jars, making sure that the jalapenos are fully submerged in the vinegar mixture. Cool for about 1 hour; cover and refrigerate.",
