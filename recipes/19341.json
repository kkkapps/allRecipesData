    "des": "\"This is a super easy but wonderfully tasty salad recipe I picked up years ago which has become a summer tradition with my family!  The ingredients and proportions are adjustable to personal preference. For added flavor, you can boil the pasta in a mixture of 1 part water and 1 part chicken broth.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse with cool water. Pour into a large dish.\nCombine mushrooms, olives, celery, onion, cheese, corn and green bell pepper with pasta; mix well.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together dressing and mayonnaise; pour dressing over salad and toss again to coat.\nGently mix in flaked chicken; refrigerate for a few hours or serve.",
