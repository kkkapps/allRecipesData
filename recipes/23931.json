    "des": "\"These are very tasty little crackers that use cornmeal and resemble homemade tortilla chips. If desired, top them with coarse salt, chili powder, cumin or garlic powder before baking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x13 inch baking pans.\nIn a small bowl, mix the milk, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce.\nIn a medium bowl, mix the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking soda. Stir in the milk mixture, and blend until a ball of dough has formed.\nOn a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for approximately 5 minutes. Divide into halves. Roll each half onto a baking sheet. Cut into small squares or triangles.\nBake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool slightly before removing from baking sheets.",
