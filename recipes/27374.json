    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPour warm water into a mixing bowl. Stir in yeast, salt, sugar, and oregano. Mix in 1 cup flour, and then stir in remaining flour. Cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to rest for 10  to 15 minutes.\nWhile dough is resting, prepare topping. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until evenly brown. Stir in green onions, and cook for 1 minute. Add eggs to the pan; cook, stirring frequently, until mixture has the consistency of scrambled eggs. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nSpread dough out evenly onto a lightly greased pizza tray, and spread pizza sauce over dough. Top with bacon and eggs, Parmesan cheese, and salami.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown on top.",
