    "des": "\"No Thanksgiving is complete without cranberry sauce. This recipe is very customizable to your family's palate. In this version, I've used honey, orange juice, and crystallized ginger. But I have made it in the past with a sweet white wine and apples, which is also delicious. Using fresh cranberries, the sauce still gets a jelly-like consistency because when  the cranberries pop open during cooking, they release pectin, which is a natural way to make jelly or jams. Once you try this recipe, you'll never go back.\"",
    "ins": "Stir orange zest and juice, honey, crystallized ginger, cinnamon stick, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Stir cranberries into orange juice mixture, cover, and bring to a boil; let boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Simmer cranberry sauce until cranberries have popped, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon stick. If a sweeter sauce is desired, stir in more honey. Serve warm or chilled.",
