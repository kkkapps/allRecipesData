    "des": "\"Paleo raw carrot cake is a spin on a traditional favorite! Made with a carrot, date and walnut base, this delicious cake is topped with a silky cashew maple coconut icing that's surprisingly healthy and good for you. This is what carrot cake dreams are made of! Keep carrot cake bites in a container in the freezer.\"",
    "ins": "Place cashews in a bowl. Cover with water and let soak, 2 to 3 hours. Drain.\nLine the bottom and sides of a loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on both sides.\nPlace dates in the bowl of a food processor; pulse into a paste. Break up paste into smaller chunks to spread it evenly in the bowl. Add carrots, walnuts, coconut flakes, 1/4 cup coconut oil, coconut flour, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg; process until base mixture is well-combined.\nSpread base mixture in the prepared loaf pan. Freeze until slightly firm, about 10 minutes.\nCombine drained cashews, coconut milk, 2 tablespoons coconut oil, maple syrup, and almond extract in the food processor. Blend until a smooth and silky icing forms.\nPour icing over base and spread it evenly across to the edges with a spatula. Sprinkle walnut pieces on top; press them into the icing gently with your fingers.\nReturn loaf pan to the freezer. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight. Lift out of the pan and slice into 16 mini carrot cake bites.",
