Set aside.\nPlace a miniature peanut butter cup upside down on a work surface; top with a dab of frosting. Center a chocolate-covered graham cracker cookie onto the frosting to make a small cap with a mortarboard. Gently press the cookie onto the peanut butter cup.\nPlace a small dab of frosting in the center of the graham cracker cookie and attach a red licorice string as a tassel, letting the tassel drape over the edge of the cookie. Place a candy-coated milk chocolate piece onto the center of the cookie over the end of the tassel to make a button.\nRepeat with remaining candies and cookies to make 50 graduation caps with tassels.",
