    "des": "\"This chicken is a variant on the popular Japanese snack yakitori.  It makes the juiciest chicken I've ever tasted. If you are using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before using so they do not catch on fire.\"",
    "ins": "In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, sherry, chicken broth, ginger, garlic powder and green onions. Bring to a boil, and immediately remove from heat. Set aside.\nPreheat your oven's broiler. Thread chicken pieces onto metal or bamboo skewers. Arrange on a broiler pan that has been coated with cooking spray. Spoon 1 or 2 tablespoons of the sauce over each chicken skewer.\nPlace the pan under the broiler, and broil for about 3 minutes, until browned. Remove from the oven, turn over, and spoon more sauce onto each one. Return to the oven until chicken is cooked through and nicely browned.",
