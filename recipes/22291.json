    "des": "\"Turkey Delight is a delicious way to use everyone's favorite Thanksgiving leftovers in a single dish. Turkey, gravy, potatoes and stuffing form a magnificent holiday quartet. I often prepare the dish on Thanksgiving Day, then cook it a few days later.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes.

Top with mashed potatoes and the remaining gravy.\nBake covered in the preheated oven 45 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.",
