    "des": "\"This is a wonderful variation on traditional cranberry sauce for your holiday dinners. It's very easy to make, and my family insists upon it every Thanksgiving and more! It is also a great base for a glaze on your Holiday Ham. For a summer cranberry salad, simply add sliced strawberries, mango, oranges, pineapple, or whatever strikes your fancy!\"",
