    "des": "\"This is a fast, easy to prepare, and filling meal. Once you try homemade mac and cheese, you'll never want the boxed stuff again. I cook mine in a soup crock.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an oven-proof soup crock or 1 cup baking dish.\nFill a small saucepan with water, and bring to a boil. Stir in the macaroni; boil until cooked but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well, and reserve.\nIn the same saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Stir in the flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and milk; whisk until smooth.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to low, and whisk in 1/3 cup cheese, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.  Stir in the cooked macaroni. Spoon the macaroni and cheese into the prepared dish. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon cheddar cheese.\nBake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted and the macaroni is heated through, about 10 minutes.",
