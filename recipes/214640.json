    "des": "\"Yes, this barbecue sauce actually calls for coffee. The coffee helps to give the sauce a unique flavor which works particularly well on beef, but you just might find yourself putting this sauce on most anything.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together the onions, coffee, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, cider vinegar, hot chilies, chili powder, garlic, and salt in a saucepan until the brown sugar has dissolved. Place over medium heat, bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.\nPour the sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth. Store in glass container in refrigerator.",
