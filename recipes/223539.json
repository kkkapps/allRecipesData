    "des": "\"I am a Canadian who spent 6 winters in Florida, and while there I met a person from New York (Brian). I did the cooking for most parties at the park, including snacks for our golf group which met twice a week after golf. Brian told me about the Push Cart Onions and I tried them with the group. They loved them. You can play with this recipe to suit your taste. Add more or less sugar, maybe a little more hot sauce, etc.\"",
    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions and green bell pepper until onions are slightly browned and soft, 8 to 12 minutes. Mix in ketchup, sugar, chili powder, hot pepper sauce, and cinnamon until thoroughly combined. Pour in water, bring mixture to a boil, and simmer uncovered until onions are tender, about 10 more minutes.",
