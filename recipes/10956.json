    "ins": "Beat egg whites with water until stiff.\nIn a large bowl, beat egg yolks with sugar, salt, and vanilla until creamy.  Fold egg whites into yolks using a wire whisk. Sift flour and anise into the bowl, and gently stir together with the whisk.  Mix will look lumpy.\nPut dough into decorating bag with round large tip, and press 1 inch rounds onto sheet.  Let cookies sit out overnight at room temperature to dry.\nThe next day, cover cookies with a sheet of parchment paper, and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes.  Cookies are done when bottom is light brown, but tops are still almost white.  Cool.\nStore in container for 2 to 3 weeks in a cool place to mellow and to turn soft.  You can add a slice of bread or a piece of apple to  help soften the cookies.",
