    "des": "\"This easy, sweet dip is excellent on a fruit platter.  I usually serve this dip at baby showers because it has a lovely pastel pink color.  The taste can easily be altered by using your choice of extract flavorings.  Also, the dip is thick enough that it can also be used as a tea sandwich filling.  This is my own creation.\"",
