    "ins": "Place bacon into a skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate, allow to cool, and crumble the bacon.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nWhisk eggs and milk in a bowl until smooth.\nHeat vegetable oil in an omelet pan or skillet over medium heat and pour in egg mixture. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom of the skillet evenly with the eggs. Cook until the omelet is barely set but the edges are not hard, 1 to 2 minutes.\nGently flip the omelet over and cook the other side, about 1 more minute.\nPlace omelet onto a broiler-safe baking sheet; top the omelet with crumbled bacon, diced tomato, deli turkey, and Monterey Jack cheese.\nFold the omelet in half to enclose the fillings and place the omelet under the broiler until the cheese bubbles, about 2 minutes.\nPlace omelet onto a serving platter and arrange the tomato slices on the omelet. Pour hollandaise sauce over the omelet and sprinkle with parsley flakes to serve.",
