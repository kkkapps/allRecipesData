    "des": "\"Middle-Eastern style puff pastry pockets filled with cheese. Great served as an appetizer or the traditional Israeli way for breakfast with salad, olives, cheese, and plain yogurt. Could also be filled with leftover mashed potatoes, or a spinach and feta mixture.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nBeat 1 egg in a medium bowl, and mix in the cheese. Season with  parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.\nOn a lightly floured surface, cut each sheet of puff pastry into 6 equal squares to give 12 squares in total. Beat the remaining egg with water in small bowl. Brush edges of each square lightly with egg wash. Place a heaping tablespoon of the cheese mixture in the center of each square. Fold pastry over the filling, and seal edges with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, brush with remaining egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\nBake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve immediately.",
