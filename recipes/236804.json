    "des": "\"You know a potato side dish is going to be good when 75% of the name refers to fat or meat. These super-crusty, oven-fried potato wedges, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsteak fries' as they call them where I'm from, are done with rendered duck fat, and while I'm a big fan of ones done with olive oil and/or butter, these really are better.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nPlace potato wedges in a bowl; sprinkle thyme, cayenne, salt, and black pepper over the top. Drizzle melted duck fat over potatoes and toss to coat.\nTransfer potatoes, skin-side down, to the prepared baking sheet. Season wedges again with salt.\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Turn potatoes onto their sides and bake for 10 minutes. Flip over and cook on the other side until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.",
