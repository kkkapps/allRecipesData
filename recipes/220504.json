    "des": "\"Another old family recipe, handed down mother to daughter. I assume it is Irish, because it was from that side of the family, and it also makes a LOT! Fortunately, it is excellent reheated (and better the next day, too!) My mother always made this with leftover holiday ham, which makes it even more economical. Can be baked in the oven (very slow!) or cooked on the stovetop (my preferred choice).\"",
    "ins": "Grease a heavy pot or Dutch oven.\nLayer about 1/3 of the potatoes into the bottom of the prepared pot.\nSpread 1/2 of the luncheon meat on top.\nSprinkle with about 1/2 of the margarine and about 1/3 of the salt. Repeat the steps once more, then layer the remaining potatoes and margarine on top. Season with salt.\nPour milk over potato mixture and cover.\nHeat pot over medium-high heat until milk begins to bubble, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.",
