    "des": "\"This is a delicious, hearty breakfast bake that can be made the night before. Pretty enough for company, and guests will surely ask you for the recipe! This can be prepared the night before and stored in the fridge. Pull it out 1 to 2 hours prior to cooking to let warm up a bit. Makes 16 squares and fills the pan to the top. It is also a great base recipe; add or change the ingredients to your taste.\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nCut the Anaheim pepper into halves lengthwise; remove and discard the stem, seeds, and ribs. Place the pepper, cut-sides down, onto the prepared baking sheet.\nCook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the pepper has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the blackened pepper into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the pepper to steam as it cools, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins; chop pepper.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nCook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; remove sausage using a slotted spoon to a plate, leaving rendered fat in the skillet.\nReturn skillet to medium-high heat. Saute onion, zucchini, bell pepper, and Anaheim pepper in hot skillet until just tender, about 4 minutes.\nStir eggs, hash browns, Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, and Swiss cheese together in a large bowl; add sausage and sauteed vegetables and stir. Pour egg mixture into prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and mixture is bubbling, about 70 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before slicing.",
