    "des": "\"Asian-style BBQ sauce that can be used for final brushing or dipping. This sauce is mod-friendly and almost impossible to ruin with whatever you add. You can use rice wine vinegar instead of white. Try it with wasabi or horseradish instead of the dry mustard. You can add 2 6-ounce cans of tomato paste for more of a ketchup consistency, or just omit the water. Use this sauce like any other thick BBQ sauce.\"",
