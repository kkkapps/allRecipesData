    "des": "\"My brother, Paul, invented these double stuffed potatoes for a barbecue we had in Mexico.  Mild green chiles, Mexi-corn, sour cream, and Pepper Jack cheese, baked until puffy and golden brown.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPierce each potato several times and rub generously with oil.  Bake until softened, about 45 to 55 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a medium bowl combine sour cream, cheese, corn and chiles.\nWhen the potatoes are cooked, cut a slit in the top of each one and squeeze or scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2 inch thick shell.  Combine the potato flesh with the cheese mixture; mix well.  Spoon the potato mixture back into the shells, and place them on a baking sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden brown.",
