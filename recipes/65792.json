Our family has this every year as a prelude to Thanksgiving dinner, along with a relish tray, to use up those last few minutes while the turkey's browning. Double it and freeze one for New Year's! Serve with an array of crackers.\"",
    "ins": "In a food processor, mix the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, blue cheese, onion, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. Process until well blended. Add olives, and pulse into small chunks.\nShape the mixture into a ball, and roll in the chopped pecans to coat. Wrap in plastic, and chill at least 4 hours in the refrigerator.",
