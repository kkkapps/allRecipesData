    "des": "\"This is so wonderful on a hot summer day (or any time of  year, for that matter). You can have your favorite coffee taste in a refreshing cooler. And it's easy to change a little bit to accommodate your favorite flavors, like by using flavored coffee creamers, or different types of coffee. I like it because, unlike other recipes, it's dairy-free. It may have some unusual ingredients, but trust me, they're necessary to make it all bond together and have the great cooler texture.\"",
