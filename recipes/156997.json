    "des": "\"My best friend who just happens to be Irish made this drink for me one cold night in Chicago and since then, I have been hooked! Warning: it is very potent, just one of these will warm you up and basically make you good for nothing afterwards - what a treat! It is super to drink at night if you have a sore throat. My friend said this is what the Irish drink if they don't feel good but don't wait until you have a cold to try this recipe!\"",
    "ins": "Press cloves into the peel of the lemon slice all the way around. Set aside. Measure the sugar into a wine glass. Place a metal spoon into the glass with the curved side facing upwards. Pour the boiling water over the back of the spoon. This will keep your wine glass from shattering. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Pour in the whiskey and add the lemon slice. Let steep for about 1 minute before drinking.",
