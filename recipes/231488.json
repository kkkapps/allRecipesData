    "des": "\"I got the basics of this recipe from a friend of mine and thought it was a great idea since these little nests can be made ahead, which I love. They are delicious, easy to make, and can be customized to your own tastes. I not only use the recipe as a delicious grab-and-go breakfast, but serve it to guests nestled into some lovely cheese grits, alongside fresh fruits and French toast made on a panini press. Oh, and don't forget the mimosas!\"",

Divide mixture between prepared muffin cups and use your fingers to shape potato mixture into nests with hollows in the middle.\nBake in the preheated oven until hash browns are browned on the edges and cheese has melted, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove hash brown nests.\nReduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhisk eggs and water in a bowl until thoroughly combined; season with salt and black pepper.
