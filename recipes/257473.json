    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.\nHeat 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and bell pepper. Cook until softened, 3 or 4 minutes; stir in garlic. Add white wine and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.\nStir in canned clams, 1/2 of the reserved clam juice, and chicken broth. Arrange fresh clams on the sauce. Bring to a low simmer; reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until clam shells open, 5 or 6 minutes. Discard clams that do not open. Stir in basil pesto and shrimp. Heat through until shrimp are bright pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and chopped basil.\nDistribute linguine among serving bowls; spoon clams, shrimp, and sauce over pasta. Top with shaved Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.",
