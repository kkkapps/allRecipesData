    "des": "\"This is a great marinade for rib, New York, sirloin, t-bone, and rib-eye steak.  The lemon juice tenderizes and the garlic-oyster sauce adds the flavour. Low sodium oyster sauce is recommended, if you can find it.\"",
    "ins": "In a shallow glass dish, combine the beer, garlic, pepper, oyster sauce and lemon juice. Mix well. Rub steaks on both sides with steak seasoning, and place in the marinade. Be sure to coat the steaks well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nRemove steaks from marinade, and discard marinade. Grill steaks for about 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness.",
