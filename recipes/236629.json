    "des": "\"Pressure cooking is making a comeback! This comfort soup is a perfect example of why. It is all-day-cooking-taste with little effort. This is one of my childhood memories of after kindergarten (half-day) at Grandma's house. If you have an abundance of homegrown tomatoes this is a good excuse to freeze them.\"",
    "ins": "Combine tomatoes with juice, chicken broth, and salt together in a pressure cooker. Cover and bring to medium pressure according to manufacturer's instructions for 3 minutes. Carefully choose quick-release to release pressure and remove lid.\nStir baking soda into tomato mixture until no longer bubbling. Add milk, cream, salt, and pepper to tomato mixture. Blend soup with a hand-held blender. Heat soup over medium-low heat, stirring often, until heated through, about 15 minutes.",
