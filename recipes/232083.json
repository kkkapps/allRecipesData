    "des": "\"This is a big pot of chili, great for when you have company; or you can freeze half and serve it again on a cold night when you don't feel like cooking. This is not too spicy for my young kids but flavorful enough to please the adults.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a large soup pot, reduce heat to low, and cook onions in the simmering water until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add ground beef to onions; cook and stir until ground beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 more minutes. Sprinkle beef with salt and black pepper as it cooks. Drain excess grease.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell peppers in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add peppers to meat mixture. Stir vegetable juice cocktail, diced tomatoes, tomato soup, chorizo sausage, green chiles, chili powder, and adobo seasoning into mixture until combined.\nBring chili to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. Cover and continue simmering to blend flavors, about 20 minutes more.",
