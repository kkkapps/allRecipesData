    "des": "\"Straying from bok choy's usual Asian flair, this lovely bright pink salad has a rich feta flavor with a fresh clean finish. The bok choy provides a nice crunch while the beets keep the tones earthy, with the feta and garlic to sharpen the flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the beets, 1/4 of the chopped garlic, and the olive oil on a piece of heavy aluminum foil; fold the foil around the beets into a sealed packet.\nRoast beets in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Let beets cool just until they can be handled, then rub with a paper towel to remove skins. Chop into 1/2-inch cubes; set aside.\nHeat the peanut oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bok choy and the remaining garlic together until bok choy is slightly softened but still crunchy, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in the beets and the feta. Serve warm.",
