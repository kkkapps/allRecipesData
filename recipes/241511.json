After much experimentation, this simple recipe is still the best. These beans are a great base. Add hot sauce and sauteed vegetables for a delicious soup. Add to your favorite burrito or serve any way you like; a meal itself or a perfect side dish. Don't be shy with salt, good beans are salty. \n\nUse whatever beans you like. My favorite beans for this recipe are black, pinto, and canary beans. Recipe is for 6 quart pressure cooker, so adjust if yours is smaller.\"",
