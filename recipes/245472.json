    "ins": "Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil and set aside.\nPeel and dice the sweet potato into 3/4-inch pieces. Add the sweet potatoes to the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the olive oil, paprika, salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Bake the sweet potatoes until they are golden brown and tender, 30-35 minutes.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together tahini, lemon juice, water, miso, shallots and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. The dressing should be a thick texture, similar to mayonnaise. If the dressing seems too thick, add a bit more water to thin. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, combine kale and the dressing. Massage by hand until the kale is thoroughly coated and begins to soften.\nCore the apple and thinly slice. Add the apple slices to the kale and toss gently to combine. Transfer the kale to a serving dish and top with the warm roasted sweet potatoes.",
