    "ins": "Heat the sesame oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.  Cook the garlic and ginger until fragrant and light brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the mango and cook for another minute to soften slightly.  Stir in the curry powder and cilantro; cook for another minute to release the flavor of the curry.\nPour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer.  Stir in the tofu and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.",
