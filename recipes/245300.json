    "des": "\"I love a one-dish baking recipe, to cut down on mess and clean-up! Unlike some gluten-free or grain-free baked goods, these have a pleasant texture as well. Experiment by adding your choice of nuts, flavored chocolate chips, and different flavor extracts. Top with icing if you wish. At Christmas, crushed candy canes and 1 1/2 teaspoons mint extract make for a nice holiday treat.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease one 8-inch cake pan and dust with almond flour.\nWhisk almond flour, honey, walnuts, cocoa powder, eggs, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Pour into prepared pan and smooth top.\nBake in the preheated oven until the center is set and edges pull away from sides of the pan, 20 to 25 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center should be clean or have a few moist crumbs attached.",
