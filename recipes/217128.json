Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the livers are cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat, and let sit for 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves.\nPlace the liver mixture into a food processor, and run the machine; add the butter to the mixture, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the hot pepper sauce, 1 more teaspoon of salt, the black pepper, and cognac to the running machine. Process until smooth; spoon into a crock or serving bowl, cover, and chill until firm.",
