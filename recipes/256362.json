Cool in the pans, about 30 minutes. Invert cakes onto a flat work surface and peel off parchment paper.\nSpread some chocolate frosting over each cake. Spread whipped cream over the chocolate frosting. Press strawberries into the whipped cream; cover with more whipped cream. Stack cake layer carefully.",
