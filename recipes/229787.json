Cook leeks until softened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Divide leeks among muffin cups and top with 2/3 cup of Cheddar cheese.\nBlend fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk, egg, sun-dried tomatoes and thyme in a blender or food processor for about 20 seconds or until tomato is minced.  Pour fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk mixture over cheese in muffin cups and top each with remaining cheese.  Bake 30 minutes or until tops and edges are browned.  Cool in pan for 3 minutes; serve warm or cold.  Top with additional pieces of sun-dried tomato, if desired.",
