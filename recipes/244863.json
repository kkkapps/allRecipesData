    "des": "\"Poblano peppers are stuffed with ground meat and Spanish rice and baked in a tomato-based sauce with a sprinkling of cheese. American comfort food done up Latin-American style. We used boxed Spanish rice, but there are a number of good recipes on this site (Spanish Rice II and Best Spanish Rice) that I have used with good results. Serve with garnishments of choice - shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 2 cups water and butter to a boil in a saucepan; add rice and seasoning packet. Return to a boil, cover saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until most water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff rice using a fork.\nSpray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nBring a pot of water to a boil; cook poblano peppers until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer peppers to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process; drain. Pat peppers dry and place in the prepared baking dish.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Season beef with black pepper. Mix 1/2 cup water, chili powder, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper into ground beef; cook and stir until liquid evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix rice into beef mixture; cook and stir until evenly mixed and all liquid is evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Spoon mixture into the peppers.\nStir tomato soup and about 1 tablespoon water together in a bowl until soup is thinned to a gravy consistency, adding more water if needed. Pour tomato gravy over stuffed peppers; top with mozzarella cheese. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until cheese is slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes more.",
