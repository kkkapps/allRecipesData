    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 16 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.\nStir the flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk the milk, plantains, eggs, oil, and butter together in a separate bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the milk mixture until just combined; do not over mix. Allow the mixture sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour into prepared muffin cups to about 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 18 minutes.",
