    "des": "\"This is such a simple recipe but it has become an annual favorite at our neighborhood block party. It's a huge hit wherever I serve it and my friends make me bring it to every get-together! This is a variation of the popular fruit pizza recipe but I use cookies because the portions are smaller, easier for people to handle and faster to prepare. Serve as soon as possible because the strawberry juice tends to run.\"",
    "ins": "Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl until creamy; refrigerate mixture until firm, about 15 minutes. Spread cream cheese mixture onto each sugar cookie. Cover cream cheese layer with strawberries, leaving a small edge of cream cheese to keep strawberry juice contained. Decorate each cookie with blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.\nWarm chocolate shell topping in a microwave-safe bowl, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Pour chocolate into a plastic freezer bag. Snip one corner off the bag with scissors; pipe chocolate onto cookies. Refrigerate cookies until ready to serve.",
