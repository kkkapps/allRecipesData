    "des": "\"This is a jungle curry recipe, meaning it is very rustic and easy to make. This does not even require you to make a curry paste. Just put all the ingredients in the coconut milk and cook. This version is vegetarian; chicken can be added if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Put the coconut milk and galangal in a pot and bring to a boil. Add the kaffir lime leaves and salt; simmer for 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir the lime juice and fish sauce into the mixture; pour into a bowl and top with the Thai chilies to serve.",
