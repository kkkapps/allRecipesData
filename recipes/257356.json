    "des": "\"These paleo tortillas are soft, pliable, and sturdy enough to be used for wraps or soft taco shells. You can even use them as wrappers for sweet fillings! Use immediately or wrap stack of tortillas in a paper towel and store in a resealable plastic bag in the fridge for a few days. Tortillas will still be soft and pliable right out of the fridge.\"",
