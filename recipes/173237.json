    "des": "\"This wonderful, fresh, summery dish, is very easy to make. I'm relatively new to fennel, but this recipe definitely highlights the wonderful, licorice-y flavor and complements it well with the citrus. This would be a great choice to accompany a fish or chicken dish.\"",
    "ins": "Place the spinach, orange sections, sliced fennel, fennel fronds, almonds, and mint into a large mixing bowl; set aside. Whisk together the olive oil, orange juice, cumin, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad, and toss gently to dress. Serve immediately.",
