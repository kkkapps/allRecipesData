    "des": "\"This is not your bbq slow pulled pork. It really shows off the pork! Just a touch of adobo sauce gives the pork a nice smokiness. Pair with fresh condiments and corn tortillas! Super easy to make and oh so tasty. Serve with corn tortillas and your favorite condiments (i.e. lime, avocado, fresh cilantro, corn salsa, and queso fresco).\"",
    "ins": "Rub the Cajun seasoning into the pork shoulder; place in the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour the pepperoncini with the juice, and the adobo sauce over the pork. Top with the onion, garlic, and cilantro. Pour enough water into the slow cooker to cover the bottom half of the pork shoulder.\nCook on Low until the meat begins to fall apart, 6 to 8 hours. Shred meat with two forks inside the slow cooker before serving.",
