    "des": "\"The first time I went to a bar with friends in Italy, I was very curious when they offered me 'toast' as pub grub. When this panino showed up I understood that Italian toast and American toast is NOT the same thing. Cooked ham, fontina cheese, and giardiniera make up this hot panino that goes well with your favorite Italian beer.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a panino press according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nPlace 1 slice prosciutto and 1 slice fontina cheese onto a slice of bread; repeat with remaining prosciutto, fontina cheese, and slice of bread. Add 1/2 of the giardiniera on top of each cheese layer and top sandwiches with remaining bread slices, creating 2 sandwiches.\nCook each panino in the press until the cheese has melted and the bread has toasted, about 3 minutes. Serve with hot pickled peppers on the side.",
