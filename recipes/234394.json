    "des": "\"A bit unusual but good all the same. You may substitute plumped raisins for the figs if you like. You may also use Splenda\u00c2\u00ae. To prevent crumbling, use finely diced dates or boil whole dates for 10 minutes before chopping. Serve with cream cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan.\nSpread walnuts onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.\nMix dates, figs, butter, and baking soda together in a bowl. Pour boiling water over the date mixture. Let sit for figs to slightly rehydrate, 15 to 20 minutes.\nStir sugar, walnuts, and eggs into date mixture. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into date mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
