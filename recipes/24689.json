    "des": "\"Very easy to prepare at home. It tastes better than most of the supermarket stuff and saves tons of money as well.  Easily modified to your taste.  Have this ready in the freezer for unexpected guests!  Try substituting condensed milk for the honey for a less sweet version.  This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.\"",

Rub the skins from the toasted nuts using a tea towel, then coarsely chop.\nLine a baking sheet with foil.  Spread chopped nuts evenly on foil.  Melt chocolate in a double boiler over simmering water.  Pour chocolate evenly over nuts.  Place in freezer until firm.  Then break into bite-size chunks.\nLine a 8x8 inch dish with foil.\nIn a small bowl, beat egg yolks until light yellow.  Beat in honey.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff.
