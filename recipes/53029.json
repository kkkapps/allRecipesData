    "ins": "Place potatoes in a large bowl, cover with cold  water, and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so. Drain, pat dry, and season with salt.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute bell pepper, poblano pepper, and onion in  butter until soft. Remove from pan, and set aside. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter and bacon fat  in pan, and fry the potatoes until crisp and medium brown. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels.\nPreheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).\nArrange the potatoes in a lightly-buttered, non-stick pan, preferably a deep, slope-sided skillet.  Arrange the onions and peppers over the potatoes, and then spread cheese over the top. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs with water, parsley, and salt and pepper; pour the mixture over the potatoes. Put the skillet in a larger pan with a half inch of water in it.\nBake in preheated oven until eggs set, about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the tortilla, let cool, and loosen edges from the pan. Put a serving plate over the skillet, and flip the tortilla over onto the plate. Cut into small pie-shape wedges. Refrigerate until ready to serve; reheat if desired.",
