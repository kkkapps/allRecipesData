    "des": "\"Sweet potatoes (minus the sweet). These are best served hot! The inside mixture will cool things down so it's edible. Remember real butter. Temperatures are important because they create the textures. I hope you all enjoy! I have turned non-sweet potato eaters into sweet potato lovers with this recipe. If you're not into onions you can use celery.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nMake a long, narrow cut lengthwise down the center of each sweet potato. Wrap each potato in aluminum foil.\nBake potatoes directly on the rack of the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour.\nMash avocado flesh, salt, and pepper together in a bowl with a fork until mostly smooth. Fold onion into avocado mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 45 minutes.\nRemove potatoes from foil and slice open, pushing the two ends of each together to open the potato. Divide 1/2 of the butter between the potato openings. Spoon avocado mixture into each potato and top each with remaining butter.",
