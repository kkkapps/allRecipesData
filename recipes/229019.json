    "des": "\"A family favorite vamp of chili from Grandma Cheryl! You MUST use a large cast-iron pan, or chili will not thicken as fast or as much! Can sub chicken breast for turkey cutlets. Jalapenos and hot sausage are optional, but add the most flavor if you're not scared of a little spice!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWrap the sausages in foil, place them on a baking sheet, and bake for 30 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir turkey in hot oil until evenly browned, about 5 minutes.\nSeason turkey with 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Add onions and garlic to the turkey; continue to cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPour in the white kidney beans and chicken broth. Season with 1 tablespoon cumin and 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.\nMix in the chopped jalapeno and the whole jalapeno peppers, if desired. Remove the sausages from the oven and cut them into bite-sized pieces. Stir the sausage into the chili.\nCook the chili until the whole jalapeno peppers are tender and chili is thick, about 15 minutes more.",
