    "des": "\"In my attempt to find a healthy, yet delicious baked salmon recipe that doesn't include all of the butter and mayonnaise that my favorite recipe contains, and that also doesn't consist of the vinegar-sugar combo that many of the recipes listed contain, I came up with this savory, creamy,and nutty recipe that I fell in love with. I hope that you love it as much as I do!\"",

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.\nMix sour cream, vegetable dip mix, garlic salt, and Creole seasoning together in a bowl.\nArrange salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Spread sour cream mixture over each fillet.\nBake in the preheated oven until fish almost flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 8 minutes; sprinkle macadamia nuts over fillets. Turn on oven's broiler.\nBroil until nuts are browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes more.",
