    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease the foil.\nMix ground beef, onion, crackers, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, and seasoned salt together in a bowl. Transfer beef mixture to the prepared baking sheet and form into a skull-shape, leaving holes for \"eye sockets\" and a \"mouth\". Place hard boiled egg halves into the \"eye sockets\", shaping the beef mixture around them to hold in place.\nMix ketchup, brown sugar, and barbeque sauce together in a bowl until sauce is smooth. Spread 1/2 of the sauce onto the entire beef mixture, including the \"eyes\" and \"mouth\".\nBake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 50 to 60. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).\nArrange the garlic pieces in the mouth for the \"teeth\". Brush the remaining sauce over the meatloaf or serve on the side.",
