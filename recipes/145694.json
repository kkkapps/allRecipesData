    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nCream the sugar and margarine together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each. Stir in the vanilla and flour, and mix well. Spread the batter over the prepared baking sheet to form a rectangle. Use a knife to mark off 12 squares. Use a spoon to make a small well in each square. Place  1 tablespoon pie filling in each well.\nBake in preheated oven until top is light brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on pan, and cut into 12 squares.",
