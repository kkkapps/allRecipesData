    "ins": "Mix the ground beef, ground pork, white rice, minced onion, and eggs together in a large bowl. Form into 1 inch meatballs; set aside.\nPlace the tomatillos and jalapenos in a saucepan and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and simmer until tomatillos have softened and begin to turn a yellow color, about 15 minutes. Drain, then transfer contents of saucepan to a blender along with the quartered onions, garlic, cilantro, green olives, and 1 cup of water. Blend until almost smooth.\nHeat the oil in the saucepan used to cook the tomatillos.  When hot, pour in the tomatillo sauce and bring to a boil, stirring. Pour in 3 cups of water and return to a boil. Season to taste with salt.\nStir in the meatballs. Add water, if needed, to cover completely. Simmer, covered, until meatballs are cooked through and the soup is thick, about 30 minutes.",
