    "des": "\"The only thing better than the taste is the fact that they are FAT FREE! They're a snap to make and the results are fantastic. I'm a health nut, always on a quest to create healthier treats, and these brownies taste as good, if not better, than the 'real thing.' Serve warm with fat-free frozen yogurt or top with fat-free whipped topping for a scrumptious chocolate dessert.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment.\nStir flour, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, sugar, and baking powder together in a bowl. Whisk milk, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir with a fork until just combined into a batter. Spread the batter into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.\nWhisk brown sugar, remaining 1/4 cup cocoa powder, and hot water together in a bowl until the sugar and cocoa dissolve; pour over the batter in the baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 40 minutes; cool brownies slightly in pan before cutting to serve.",
