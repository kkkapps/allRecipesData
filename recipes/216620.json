    "des": "\"This amalgamation of recipes produces a very mild shredded pork taco filling: tasty, but not as intensely Mexican as one might prefer. I suggest using this as a basis and adapting to suit with the addition of various peppers, sauces, spices, etc. The true beauty of this recipe is that it can be made in a pressure cooker in about an hour. Serve in corn or flour tortillas.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the garlic powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Thoroughly rub the spice mixture over the pork.\nPlace the roast in a pressure cooker with the beef broth, bay leaves, and onion over medium-high heat. Seal the cooker, and bring to full pressure; reduce the heat to maintain high pressure, and cook for 45 minutes.\nRemove the pressure cooker from the heat and allow the pressure to drop naturally. Transfer the pork to a serving bowl and shred the meat with forks.",
