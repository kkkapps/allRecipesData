    "ins": "Whisk together 2/3 cup sugar, flour, cocoa, and egg yolks in a saucepan.  Stir in milk.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thick.  I start with a whisk and then use a spoon to stir the custard as it cooks.\nRemove pan from heat, and add vanilla and butter or margarine.  Mix well, and pour filling into a baked, deep dish pie crust.\nIn a mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until peaks form.  Slowly add 1/2 cup sugar, and beat again until stiff peaks form.  Spread on pie.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes, or until meringue browns.  Let pie cool several hours before serving.",
