    "des": "\"Love California roll sushi, but don't have the nori or rolling mat? Try this simple and fast rice salad. It's easy to swap out ingredients to make it to your liking. Try avocado, ahi tuna, smoked fish, or even strips of salami to customize the recipe. Serve sushi with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger.\"",
