    "ins": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, mushrooms, green peppers, and pinch of salt. Saute until vegetables begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes; add minced garlic and cook another minute.\nPush vegetables to one side of skillet. Add the sliced meat to the open area and saute until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes.\nIn a separate saucepan, heat Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional Sauce, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper over medium heat.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nSlice rolls lengthwise and place, opened, on a baking sheet. Toast for 30 seconds under a broiler on low heat, watching them carefully so they don't burn; remove from oven. Rub toasted sides of rolls with cut side of whole garlic clove; brush lightly with olive oil.\nFold cheese slices into meat and onion/pepper mix and stir until cheese begins to melt; distribute among the toasted roll bottoms. Top with a generous spoonful of Ragu(R) sauce; save the rest for dipping if desired.\nSprinkle with fresh basil. Serve immediately.",
