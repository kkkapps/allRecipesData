    "des": "\"These meatballs are great! I came up with them on a whim one night while searching through my pantry trying to answer the age old question, 'What's for dinner?' My family LOVES these! I have also taken them to several BBQ's and they are ALWAYS a big hit! For dinner, I like to serve them with a side of steamed minute rice to go along with the meatballs. I hope you enjoy!\"",
