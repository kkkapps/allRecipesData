    "des": "\"A sweet and salty brine is the secret to this Asian-inspired pork tenderloin. Let the pork tenderloin soak in the brine for 2 to 8 hours to become tender, juicy, and flavorful. Grill and serve the sliced tenderloin with the Asian glaze. Complete the meal with brown rice, glazed carrots, and steamed green vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "To make the brine, mix together the water, 1/2 cup brown sugar, salt, 2 tablespoons ginger, onion, lemon, 5 cloves of garlic, and 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce in a large container. Add the pork tenderloin, cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 8 hours.\nFor the glaze, whisk together 1/2 cup  teriyaki sauce, sweet and sour sauce, hoisin sauce, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons ginger, brown sugar, and orange juice.\nPrepare an outdoor grill for high heat.\nCook the pork tenderloin on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 12 minutes per side. Remove the tenderloin from the grill and cover with foil; allow to rest for 10 minutes. To serve, brush with glaze, and cut into thin slices.",
