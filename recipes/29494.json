    "des": "\"A simple and quick way to prepare the very affordable and versatile tilapia. Recipe could also be used for any mild-flavored firm-fleshed white fish fillets, or even chicken.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat bottom of a medium baking dish with about 1/4 cup olive oil.\nIn a  small bowl, blend remaining olive oil, tomato paste, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper.\nArrange tilapia fillets in the prepared baking dish, skin side up. With a spatula, spread the olive oil and tomato paste mixture over the tilapia, heaping the majority in the centers of the fillets. Arrange onion and green pepper slices on and around the fillets.\nBake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Remove from heat, top each fillet with 1 tablespoon butter, and set oven to broil. Broil 5 to 7 minutes, until butter is melted and lightly brown.",
