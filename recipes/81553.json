    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake empty pie shell for 10 minutes.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef until browned, stirring occasionally to crumble; drain fat. Stir in hot dogs, beans, ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, taco seasoning, and cheese cubes. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.\nSpread beef mixture into baked pie shell. Cut American cheese slices into strips, and make a lattice on top of pie.\nBake for 5 to 10 minute, or until cheese is slightly melted.",
