    "des": "\"This was perfect when the family was down with colds! The zucchini replaces noodles in the soup and no one even realizes it until you tell them. Add black olives, green onions, more leek, and/or cooked chicken in the last 10 minutes of cooking the pho, if desired. Put cilantro and lime on the table so folks can add more to their dishes. Water crackers or hard-crusted dipping bread are nice on the side. And if anyone is suffering from a head cold, just leaning over their hot bowl inhaling the vapors is soothing therapy!\"",
