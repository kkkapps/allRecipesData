    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and grease paper with butter.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.\nBeat white sugar and eggs together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth and color lightens, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and paddle with a rubber spatula. Add pumpkin, oil, and vanilla and beat on low until blended.\nBeat flour mixture into pumpkin mixture on low until flour is just incorporated. Mix butterscotch chips into dough.\nDrop 1/4-cup scoops of dough 2 1/2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Slightly flatten the tops of the dough with a spatula.\nBake the cookies in batches in the preheated oven until tops feel firm and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cookie comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring cookies to wire racks to cool completely. Dust cooled cookies with confectioners' sugar.",
