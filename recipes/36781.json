    "des": "\"Super lemony muffins made with lemon juice and lemon yogurt. A delicious twist on the traditional muffin recipe! For an old-fashioned alternative to the icing, simply dust confectioner's sugar lightly over muffins. Either way, they are delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease muffin tins, or line with paper liners.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the lemon yogurt, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg; stir into the lemon mixture until just blended. Spoon batter into the prepared tins.\nBake for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Allow the muffins to cool for about 15 minutes before removing them from the pan.\nPlace the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Stir in the lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon at a time until the mixture is drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cooled muffins, and allow the icing to set before serving.",
