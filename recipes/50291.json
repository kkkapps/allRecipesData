    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nIn a large roasting pan, combine the onion, celery, carrot, pepper, and garlic. Stir in the beef broth, onion soup mix and water so that the soup mix is dissolved. Season the roast with salt and coarse ground pepper, and place into the roasting pan.\nPlace the uncovered roasting pan into the preheated oven. After 1 hour of roasting, begin basting every 30 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature, and bake until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 130 to 140 degrees F (55 to 60 degrees C) for medium rare, or 145 to 155 degrees F (63 to 68 degrees C)  for medium well. When the temperature has reached 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), you will need to begin checking more often.\nWhen the roast is done, remove the meat to a platter, and set aside. Place the roasting pan full of stuff onto the stove top. Cook over medium heat, mashing the vegetables against the side of the pan with a large spoon. Simmer to reduce the sauce to about half. This may take 20 or 30 minutes depending on the size of pan. Strain the juice over the meat, and let it begin to cool in the juices. When the meat has cooled, wrap and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. Reserve juices in a separate container.\nWhen the roast is cold, unwrap it, and slice against the grain as thinly as possible. An electric meat slicer works best, but a sharp knife or electric carving knife will also work well. Skim the fat from reserved juices, and heat the meat in the juice over low heat. Adjust seasonings to taste before serving.",
