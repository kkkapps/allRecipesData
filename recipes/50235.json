    "des": "\"Wow...A favorite with all my family and friends. I refuse to give any of them the recipe because it is so easy. I love it when they keep asking for it! I often throw all the ingredients into slow cooker and head to work. We all eat when ever we get in the door. The au jus is great! Add beef to lightly toasted buns, and dip away in the au jus.\"",
    "ins": "Place roast in slow cooker. Season with garlic and rosemary and add bay leaves. Pour in soy sauce and water. Cook on Low setting for 6 to 10 hours. Unlike most roasts, the longer it cooks, the better.",
