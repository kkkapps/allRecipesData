    "des": "\"I invented this one day after becoming a huge fan of mangosteen juice. A couple teaspoons of cream of coconut adds a hint of tropical sweetness. Don't use ice. Use frozen fruit to make it a true smoothie. To prepare a virgin margarita, replace the rum with pineapple juice or another fruit juice of your choice.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the margarita mix, mangosteen juice, and rum into a blender or bowl of a food processor. Blend until smooth. Gradually add the frozen fruit, and continue blending. Pour the mixture into four tall glasses and garnish with mango slices.",
