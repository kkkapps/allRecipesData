    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nSift together wheat and all-purpose flours, baking powder, salt, sugar and cinnamon into a large bowl. Rub butter into dry ingredients until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in dates and chocolate chips. Mix in the milk, just until blended and form dough into a ball.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface. Roll into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Dip a round cookie cutter into flour (to prevent sticking) then cut out round scones. Place scones on a greased baking sheet. Brush with milk and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mixture.\nBake in preheated oven until risen and golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.",
