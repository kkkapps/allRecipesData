    "des": "\"These have a lot of oats in them too. This is such a hit in my family. My 16-month old even loves them. I use applesauce instead of butter and cut down on the sugar. You can replace the butterscotch chips with additional chocolate chips if you prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the applesauce, white sugar and brown sugar until well blended. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Gradually stir in the flour and oats, then fold in the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.\nBake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottoms are golden. Cool on wire racks.  Tip: when you take them out, put them on a spread out paper bag. It'll absorb even more grease and it's easy clean-up.",
