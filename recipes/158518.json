    "des": "\"This rich and satisfying soup is the best I've ever created. Hubby is always excited when I make a prime rib because he knows this soup will follow within a day or two. The ribs are sliced from the prime rib before serving and saved just for this recipe. I always buy a prime rib with the bones in because it makes the roast better tasting and the ribs are a bonus not to be missed!\"",
    "ins": "Place the ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the meat is falling from the bones, about 2 hours. Remove the ribs and allow to cool. Trim the meat from the ribs and cut into bite sized pieces; refrigerate. Continue simmering the broth until reduced to 1 cup; refrigerate until the fat congeals to the top.\nSkim and discard the congealed fat. Pour the broth into a saucepan along with the meat trimmings, beef stock, potato, mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with chives to serve.",
