    "des": "\"This is a warm, chewy apple dessert with a brownie-like texture. Served in a cast iron skillet, it's an impressive presentation, perfect for company. Serve with good quality vanilla ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place an 8- or 9-inch cast iron skillet into the oven to preheat. Whisk together the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl; set aside.\nBeat together the eggs, vanilla extract, and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Toss the apples and pecans in the flour mixture, then stir into the egg mixture until combined. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in the preheated skillet, swirling to coat the pan.\nPour the batter into the hot pan, and replace into the oven. Bake until the sides are dry and a toothpick inserted into the center of the brownie comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the skillet 20 minutes before removing and slicing.",
