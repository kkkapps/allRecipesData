    "des": "\"This recipe came from my high school cooking class. Over the years I have tweaked it and retweaked it so many times that I have changed it to a mincemeat cake with either pecans or walnuts. It tastes similar to fruitcake, but without the candied fruit. When the kids ask me to make a fruitcake, this is the one they are referring to. At different times I have added coconut, candied fruitcake fruit, and chopped dried fruit. It has a bit of a fruitcake flavor. If you add extra ingredients and it causes the batter to be too moist, more flour can be added. Up to 1/2 cup flour can be added without changing other ingredients. If you add more flour than that, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat  oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray an angel food tube pan or 2 5x9-inch bread pans with nonstick cooking spray.\nSift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, and salt together into a bowl.\nStir the mincemeat pie filling, sugar, eggs, raisins, maraschino cherries, carrots, pecans, applesauce, canola oil, brandy flavoring, and vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl. Mix about 1/3 of the flour mixture into the mincemeat mixture at a time, stirring 3 or 4 times after each addition. If the batter seems dry, stir in reserved maraschino juice, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until batter is desired consistency. Spoon the batter into prepared cake pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.",
