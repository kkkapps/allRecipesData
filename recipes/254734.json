    "des": "\"Tiramisu with a chocolaty twist. Oreos\u00c2\u00ae are substituted for the traditional lady finger cookies, which are then dunked in booze. Speaking of which, with a cup of liquor/wine in the recipe (the former of which is definitely not cooked off) makes for quite a potent dessert--be aware!\"",
    "ins": "Beat egg yolks in the bowl of a double boiler until fluffy. Beat sugar into egg yolks until incorporated; beat in wine. Heat egg mixture over the double boiler until the cream thickens and small bubbles appear, about 5 minutes.\nStir the mascarpone cheese with a rubber spatula in a bowl until creamy. Pour egg mixture over the cheese; beat until filling is smooth.\nBeat cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form; fold into cheese mixture.\nCombine coffee-flavored liqueur and rum in a small bowl. Dunk enough cookies in the liquor to create a layer across the bottom of a baking pan; arrange cookies in the baking pan to create a cake base. Cover cookies with half of the filling. Dunk a second layer of cookies; arrange on the filling. Top with remaining filling; sprinkle with cocoa powder.\nPlace in the refrigerator until chilled, 3 to 4 hours.",
