    "ins": "Place eggs in a large mixing bowl, and beat until frothy. Gradually beat in the flour and salt to make a soft dough. Roll out the dough to be fairly thin, about 1/8 inch,  and cut into 2 inch by 5 inch strips. Cut a slit down the center of each strip, and twist so one end slides through the slit and makes a loop.\nHeat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep skillet (or use a deep-fat fryer) over medium-high heat, 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCook dough in small batches in preheated oil until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
