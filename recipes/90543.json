    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned. Add garlic and onion, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook and stir just until fragrant. Mix in the green beans, cover and cook to your desired doneness, at least 5 minutes.\nUncover, and stir in the cream and cheese just until everything is coated. Remove from the heat and enjoy.",
