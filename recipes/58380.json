    "des": "\"Rich, buttery soup with pieces of artichoke heart and oyster. If you love oysters or artichokes you can add half-again as much of these ingredients. You can also use 1 pint each heavy cream and half-half for a less rich soup. This soup does not freeze well so don't cook more than you can eat within a few days!\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender, about 10 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, and reduce heat to low. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add the artichokes and oysters, and simmer for 10 more minutes. Finally, stir in the heavy cream and half-and-half cream. Cook until heated through, but do not boil, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.",
