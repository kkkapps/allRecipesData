    "des": "\"It's an assortment of wonderfully interesting flavors that work well together. Surprisingly. I saw a similar recipe on line somewhere (not here) and I took the base and left out the exotic things (I can't identify or get) and then expounded on it. It's origin is Vietnamese. It has a very healthy and light flavor.\"",
    "ins": "In a slow cooker, combine the asparagus, crabmeat, fish sauce, spinach, tofu, oregano and garlic. Fill with enough water to cover by about 2 inches. Cover, and cook on High for 45 minutes, or until you smell the aroma and the spinach has cooked down dramatically.",
