    "des": "\"A beautiful, shiny petit four icing with a hint of butter in the taste. Simple, easily colored, and a bit more opaque than most petit four icings. It can also be used on larger cakes if desired, but the sides of the cake will sometimes get a bit lumpy, so it's not something you'd want to use for large cakes on display. You may add food coloring, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare a double boiler over medium heat; bring 2 inches of water in the lower pot to a simmer. Sift confectioners' sugar and salt into the top of the boiler. Add corn syrup and 1/2 cup warm water; whisk until well blended. Stir with a spatula until icing is completely smooth and an instant-read thermometer registers no higher than 105 degrees F (40 degrees C), about 5 minutes.\nStir butter flavoring, almond extract, and vanilla extract into the icing. Keep stirring until icing takes on a glossy sheen and flows easily off of the spatula, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.",
