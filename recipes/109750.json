    "des": "\"This is a quick, flavorful dish that looks gourmet.  The spread works well with other mild white fish.  Serve with your favorite vegetable and couscous for an easy weeknight meal.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nPlace the orange roughy filets on the broiler pan and squeeze the lemon over the top of the fish.  Broil the filets in the preheated oven for about 6 to 8 minutes.\nCombine parmesan, butter, dijionnaise, garlic, and salt in a small bowl.  Remove the fish from the oven and spread the cheese mixture on top of the filets.  Sprinkle with paprika.  Broil until the topping is lightly browned and the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes.",
