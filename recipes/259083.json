Form lamb mixture into 8 cylinders approximately 1x3 inches in size, using about 3 tablespoons of mixture per cylinder.\nReduce grill heat to medium; transfer lamb to grill and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from grill.\nMix yogurt, tahini, and lemon juice together in a bowl until sauce is uniform.\nSpread 1/4 of the yogurt sauce down the middle of each pita; top with lamb, tomato, feta cheese, and lettuce.",
