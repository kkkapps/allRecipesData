    "des": "\"I developed this recipe from a basic mac-n-cheese recipe, adding pears which go well with the sharp Cheddar. For the sausage, we like Aidell's\u00c2\u00ae Chicken and Apple or Roasted Garlic Gruyere sausages. They are fully cooked and very flavorful! To use as a side dish, leave out the sausage.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 3-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain macaroni and transfer to the prepared casserole dish.\nHeat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onions in the melted butter until partially translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk in flour until paste-like consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Slowly stream in milk, stirring constantly, until flour mixture is incorporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese until completely melted and and sauce has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPour cheese sauce into macaroni; stir to coat. Season with black pepper. Stir in sausage.\nReserve 4 slices of pears; dice remaining pear slices and stir into macaroni mixture. Arrange the reserved slices atop macaroni mixture.\nStir 2 tablespoons melted butter and bread crumbs together in a small bowl; sprinkle over macaroni mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.",
