    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, crumble into bacon bits.\nPreheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.\nCombine the cauliflower, olive oil, garlic, salt, and black pepper in large bowl. Spread the cauliflower on the foil-lined baking sheet, and roast in the preheated oven until the cauliflower is lightly browned, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool.\nPlace the cooled roasted cauliflower, sour cream, and mayonnaise in a large bowl; stir.  Fold in the shredded Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, green onion, chives, pepper sauce, and paprika. Adjust salt and black pepper. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours before serving.",
