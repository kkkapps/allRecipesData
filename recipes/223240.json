    "des": "\"A delicious way to stretch ground beef. This is a traditional Scottish recipe. It's quick and very easy, and my family loves it with mashed potatoes. The combination of beef and oatmeal sounds really weird at first, I know, but it is delicious. Steel-cut oats can be a bit pricey, but one tin will last a long, long time. Leftovers of this are wonderful. I've made sandwiches with it; I've filled tortillas with it; I've wrapped it in puff pastry and made little pies. It's very easy and it's very good! I hope your family likes it as much as mine does.\"",
    "ins": "Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium heat; add onion, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir the ground beef until no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes.\nStir oats into beef mixture to coat in beef drippings. Pour beef stock over beef mixture; bring to a boil, place cover on the skillet, and reduce heat to low. Cook at a simmer until the oats are cooked, about 30 minutes.\nStir Worcestershire sauce through the beef mixture to serve.",
