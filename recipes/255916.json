Stir to combine.\nAdd in garlic, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil. Stir to combine.\nCook for about ten minutes or until broccoli is tender.\nBreak three Eggland's Best eggs over mixture. Do so carefully so that the yolk stays in tact to the membrane.\nPlace skillet in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.\nRemove and garnish with fresh herbs of choice - I used cilantro.",
