It was a popular item at the restaurant, always requested and it is still my family and friends favorite today! I have added my own special touches to make it even better. This can also be served over rice instead of tortillas.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken breasts in a saucepan with enough water just to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until meat shreds easily. Remove chicken from water, shred, and set aside. Reserve water.\nHeat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add onion, and cook until transparent. Add shredded chicken meat, and stir in the picante sauce, and 1/2 cup of the reserved chicken water. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes, or until the sauce is thick. Remove the pan from heat, and sprinkle cheese over the chicken mixture.\nServe over flour tortillas and garnish with sliced olives and sour cream.",
