    "des": "\"I first tried this when I was visiting my sister in West Virginia.  After trying it, I loved it, however I neglected to ask her for the recipe.  10 years later, I have it, and I still love it!  The kids can help make it if you use an air popper (which I did to reduce fat and calories...there's enough in the butter!)  I used my deep dish lasagna pan to cook it in the oven.  You can use a roasting pan or any other large, deep dish pan.  It makes a lot, so either invite your friends or store it in an airtight container for later.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Pop the popcorn using an air popper according to manufacturer's directions. Place into a large mixing bowl, and set aside.\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sugar, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla, and cook until thick and bubbly. Pour over the popcorn, and stir until the popcorn is evenly coated. Spread the popcorn into a large roasting pan.\nBake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, then turn the heat off, and allow the popcorn to stay in the oven 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven, and cool completely before serving.",
