    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill to 350 degrees. Lay out two large sheets of  Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil (long enough to wrap fish).\nSprinkle inside of the trout with kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. Place 3 to 4 lemon slices, sliced leeks and a couple sprigs of fresh dill into each cavity.\nPlace 3 slices of lemon down the middle of each foil sheet and lay the stuffed fish on top and fold the foil up loosely around the fish and seal seems tightly.\nPlace the two packets on the grill and cook until fish is cooked through and flakes easily, 18 to 22 minutes.\nRemove packets from grill, unwrap and season with a little more salt and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, if desired.",
