Top with VELVEETA. Crack egg over VELVEETA in each bowl; place on baking sheet.\nBake 20 to 25 min. or until egg whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but do not become firm, adding tops of rolls, cut-sides up, to baking sheet for the last 5 min.\nSprinkle eggs with chives. Replace tops of rolls. Serve with remaining bacon slices.",
