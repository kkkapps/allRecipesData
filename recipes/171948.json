    "des": "\"Flavorful take on an old bbq standby. Other seasonings can be added as well, depending on preference. I find that chili powder adds a nice kick. Serve right after tossing if you prefer a nice crunchy slaw or let marinade in the fridge for an hour before dishing up. Great with grilled veggies, Mexican style corn on the cob, and smoked chicken breast.\"",
