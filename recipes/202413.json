    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prepare a pizza pan with olive oil and flour.\nHeat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside.\nDust a flat working surface with flour. Roll the pizza dough out to the size of your pizza pan. Place dough on the prepared pan.\nStir the tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; spread evenly over the surface of the dough. Scatter, in order, the chicken, chourico, red onion, banana peppers, pizza cheese, and Parmesan over the tomato sauce mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven on the middle rack until the cheese is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Switch the oven setting to broil and cook another 5 minutes.",
