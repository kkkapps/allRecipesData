    "des": "\"This crust was used by  Elsie Hack to win the 1978 Ohio State Fair pie baking contest. (It was wrapped around an apple pie.) Because the crust is very flaky when baked, it is a bit difficult to roll and handle,  but well worth the effort.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. With a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until pea-sized.\nBeat together egg, vinegar and water.  Mix  liquid with flour mixture, using a fork, until mixture forms a ball (Note: add liquid one tablespoon at a time.  You probably will not use all of it.)\nRoll out on lightly floured pastry cloth with cloth covered roller.\nBrush the crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar before baking.",
