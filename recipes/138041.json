    "des": "\"This delicious, simple recipe that I put together after asking various people what to do with rainbow trout!  The soy sauce can be adjusted to taste.  My family loves this with steamed rice and snow peas.\"",
    "ins": "Rub trout fillets with soy sauce. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar; set aside.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic, ginger, and green onions; cook and stir until golden brown. Add trout fillets and cook until browned and crispy, about 3 minutes. Turn fillets over, and continue cooking until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more.",
