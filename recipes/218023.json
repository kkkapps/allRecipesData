    "des": "\"This cobbler tastes just like your grandma's but has a twist in the topping!  This recipe works great with any other type of fruit as well.  As with any recipe using fresh fruit, you need to taste it first to determine how much sugar needs to be added to it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace the blackberries in a large saucepan with 1 cup of sugar. Dissolve the cornstarch in the cold water, and stir into the berries. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook until bubbly and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour the blackberries into a 9x13-inch baking dish; set aside.\nWhisk the flour with 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a mixing bowl. With a pastry cutter, cut in the cold butter until crumbly. Stir in the pecans, oats, and brown sugar until evenly blended. Stir in the hot water until evenly moistened. Drop the batter over the blackberries by the spoonful.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the berries are bubbly, about 25 minutes.",
