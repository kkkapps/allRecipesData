Not exactly low cal...but full of protein for sure. Tweaked a bit to make it mine. Can you say Keeper? Make your sandwiches with coleslaw if you're from the south! The recipe freezes very well.\"",

Remove the turkey thighs, and shred meat using 2 forks. Discard bones. Return the shredded turkey meat to the slow cooker. To serve, place about 1/2 cup of shredded turkey and sauce onto each potato roll.",
