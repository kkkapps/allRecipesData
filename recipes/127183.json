    "des": "\"This recipe is from Spain.  Sherry or lemon juice is not always used, but either one adds a nice contrast to the richness of the oil and garlic. You can easily substitute squid or scallops for the shrimp.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, and paprika in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and the garlic has turned golden brown, increase heat to high and add the shrimp. Cook until the shrimp turn pink and opaque, about 3 minutes.\nDeglaze the pan with sherry or lemon juice and  season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve garnished with chopped parsley.",
