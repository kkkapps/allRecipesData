Select Dough cycle; press Start. Check dough after 5 minutes of mixing, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water if necessary.\nWhen the cycle is complete, spoon out dough with tablespoon and roll into walnut sized balls.  Place 2 inches apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.\nFlatten balls slightly with the palm of your and make a depression in center with your thumb.  Fill with 1 tablespoon of filling.  Cover and let rise for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven for 13 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned.
