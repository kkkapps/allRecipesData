    "ins": "Run the tomatoes through a food mill to remove the seeds and skins, and place in a large pot over medium heat.  Stir in the bouillon, sugar, salt, bay leaf, basil and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes.  (If you're going to can this mixture, process it now.)\nIn a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.  Whisk in flour all at once to form a roux, cook 1 minute.  Whisk in milk, a little at a time, cooking and stirring constantly until thickened.  Stir into tomato mixture and heat through.",
