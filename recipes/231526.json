    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut ham into 1/4-inch thick slices and tie slices back together in shape of original ham, using kitchen string. Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.\nStir honey and cloves together in a bowl and drizzle honey mixture over ham.\nBake ham in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, basting often with pan drippings.\nMix brown sugar, horseradish, and lemon juice together in a bowl. Baste ham with horseradish glaze, allowing glaze to drip between slices.\nContinue baking until glaze has set, ham has browned, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the sliced ham reads at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 25 to 30 more minutes.",
