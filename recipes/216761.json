    "des": "\"This is my friend Judy's sauerkraut recipe, and in my opinion, it's simply the best.  Great served with crusty rye bread, mashed potatoes, and freshly cooked apples. Combine the kraut with a meat entree and bake in the oven at a low temperature 1 to 2 hours.  Examples of meat entrees that work really well are small pork roasts, tenderloins, or chops, bratwursts, knockwursts, and kielbasa.  Slow cooker temperatures vary, so this may be done sooner than 8 hours.\"",
    "ins": "Place the sauerkraut, bacon drippings, and onion into a slow cooker. Pour in the beef broth, then season with cloves, bay leaf, juniper berries, caraway seed, salt, and sugar. Stir to combine.\nCook on Low 8 hours.",
