Combine shortening with flour mixture using fingers until the mixture is crumbly and resembles cornmeal. Stir milk in gradually until dough is well combined.\nPlace dough on a floured surface; shape into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle about 12 inches wide.\nPut honey and butter into a microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 15 to 20 seconds. Stir.\nSpread 1/2 the honey-butter mixture on the dough surface; roll up like a jellyroll and cut into 12 slices, about 1 inch thick. Arrange biscuits on a baking sheet 1/2-inch apart; spread remaining honey-butter on each.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes.",
