    "des": "\"You won't believe how chocolate-y and moist these brownies are. I like to make them in mini muffin cups with mini foil cupcake liners. Dust them with powdered sugar and you have a decadent treat with the benefit of more protein, more fiber, and fewer fat calories.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBlend black beans and water together in a blender until smooth; pour into a bowl. Stir brownie mix into black bean mixture until batter is smooth; fold in 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the side of the pan comes out clean, 25 to 27 minutes. Cool brownies completely on a wire rack before cutting into squares.",
