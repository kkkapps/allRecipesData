    "ins": "Grease one 2-quart lidded pudding mold.  Sift together the flour, sugar and cinnamon; set aside.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the eggs, butter, mincemeat, cranberry sauce and pumpkin. Add to flour mixture and mix until smooth; pour into pudding mold.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large pot, over medium heat, and fill 1/2 way up with boiling water.  Place the pudding on the rack. Steam for 2 1/2 hours.\nCheck the pan occasionally and add more water if needed. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center. When firm, place the pudding mold on a rack outside of the water for 10 minutes and unmold.\nPrepare a sauce by blending together the sour cream, cream cheese and confectioners sugar. Spoon dollops over warm pudding and serve.",
