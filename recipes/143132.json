    "des": "\"A little lime, salt, and honey go a long way in this dish created out of sheer boredom. One night last summer we were grilling fish and corn, yet again.  When I asked my boyfriend what he wanted as a second side dish, all he said was, 'something different.'  I decided to try a twist on the traditional fruit salad that I grew up eating, and it was a huge hit!  The best thing about this recipe is that most fruits are great with the dressing, so you can use your favorites or whatever is in season.\"",
