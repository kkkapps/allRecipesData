    "des": "\"This tender, extra-flaky crust has lard, brown sugar, vinegar, and egg in it.\"",
    "ins": "Measure flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder into large bowl. Mix thoroughly and cut in lard until dough is the size of tiny peas.\nBreak egg into 8 ounce measuring cup. Beat with a fork, then pour in vinegar. Add enough cold water to reach the top (you will have a total of 1 cup liquid). Pour over flour mixture a little at a time, tossing and stirring with a fork until all liquid is absorbed.\nShape dough into a ball, then divide into four equal portions. Wrap tightly. Can be stored in refrigerator up to 2 weeks, or freezer up to 6 months. Each portion will make 1 double crust pie.",
