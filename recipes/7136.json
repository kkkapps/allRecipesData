    "ins": "Heat milk and butter or margarine over low heat until very warm.\nCombine sugar, salt, yeast, and 1 cup of flour in a large bowl.  Stir in hot milk mixture, and beat with mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.  Beat in 1 more cup of flour, and continue beating for 2 more minutes.   With a wooden spoon, stir in enough flour (about 2 cups) to make a soft dough.\nKnead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary. Cover dough with bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, shred muenster cheese.  Combine with 1 egg and 1 egg yolk.\nOn a lightly floured surface and with a floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 24 x 6 inch rectangle. Spoon the cheese mixture into a log shape lengthwise along the dough.  Fold the dough over the cheese making a 1 inch overlap, and pinch seam to seal.  In a greased 9 inch round cake pan, place roll, seam side down, to make a ring.  Overlap the ends, and pinch to seal.  Cover with a towel.  Let rest 10 minutes.\nBrush loaf with egg white, and garnish with blanched almonds, if desired.  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove bread from pan immediately.  Cool for 15 minutes before slicing into wedges.",
