Remove peppers; discard skins, seeds, and stems. Chop peppers and onion slices roughly.\nPlace peppers, onions, parsley, bread, lemon juice, garlic, and thyme in a blender; pulse until roughly chopped. Drizzle olive oil into running blender until mixture becomes smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt, stir to combine.",
