    "des": "\"This is a traditional Indian sweet, prepared all over India.  It is the standard offering to God, that is cooked as 'prasad' after a 'Pooja'.  This recipe is made using 1 1/4 of any measure(instead of one) by Hindus as they believe using the extra measure will usher in prosperity and happiness.\"",
    "ins": "Soften the saffron threads in  the hot milk; set aside.  Heat oil over medium heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in the semolina.  Cook until toasted and light brown, stirring constantly.\nBring the milk to a boil in a separate saucepan.  Turn heat to medium-low and stir in the semolina and banana; cover and cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the sugar, cover and cook for an additional minute.\nMeanwhile, in a separate pan, heat ghee over medium-high heat.  Add cashews and raisins; cook until the raisins puff.  Pour the raisins into the semolina, mix well, and cook covered for another minute.",
