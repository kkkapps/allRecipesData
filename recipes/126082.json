    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir together the minced garlic, soy sauce, and honey together in a small saucepan.  Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, and chili powder.  Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 15 minutes, then set aside.\nWhile the sauce is simmering, roll the ground moose into meatballs in 2 tablespoon portions.  Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the meatballs in batches until well browned, and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes; drain well.\nPlace the drained meatballs into a baking dish.  Pour on the sauce, and stir until well coated.  Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes so the meatballs absorb some of the sauce.",
