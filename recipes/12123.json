    "des": "\"This is a variation of the traditional Apple Crisp that I dreamed up one day when I didn't have enough apples, and there were pears in the fruit bowl, and leftover toasted walnuts from something else. We love it. Cranberries can be substituted with raisins or dried cherries. Comice pears taste best with this recipe.\"",

Lightly grease an 8 inch baking dish.\nMix the apples, pears, cranberries, 1 tablespoon flour, honey, and lemon juice in the prepared dish.\nIn a bowl, mix 1/2 cup flour, brown sugar, oats, walnuts, and butter to the consistency of coarse crumbs. Sprinkle loosely over the fruit mixture.\nBake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until brown and crisp on top.",
