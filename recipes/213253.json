    "ins": "Place carrots in a large, heavy pot, then layer mushrooms, corn, Savoy cabbage, butternut squash, tomatoes, and water on top. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.\nWhile the soup is coming to a boil, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef and taco seasoning. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add beef to the soup, and reduce heat to medium. Continue simmering until the carrots are tender, about 1 hour.",
