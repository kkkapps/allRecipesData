    "des": "\"Chinese hand-pulled noodles, a tradition from Lanzhou in northwest China, require just 3 ingredients and a little patience to make. Called lamian, you can serve the noodles in your favorite Chinese broth for a delectable and warming meal.\"",
    "ins": "Place flour in a large bowl and gradually mix in water. Mix until dough comes together; knead until smooth, 15 to 20 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.\nKnead dough again for 2 minutes; cover and let rest for 15 minutes.\nKnead dough one more time for 2 minutes. Divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/3-inch-thick sheet. Brush both sides of each sheet with oil. Stack sheet together; cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.\nFill a large saucepan with water and bring to the boil.\nPlace one sheet of dough on a cutting board and slice into 1/8-inch-wide strips. Take one end of a strip in each hand and stretch it until it is 33 inches long. Fold it in thirds and stretch again to the same length; shake and slap against the counter several times to lengthen it to 6 1/2 feet. Drop it into the boiling water. Add 2 to 3 more strips of noodles to the boiling water; cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer drained noodles to a serving bowl.\nRepeat with remaining sheets of dough.",
