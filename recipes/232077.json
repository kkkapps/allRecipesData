    "des": "\"This is a tasty and very easy sandwich to make. It is sort of a cross between a peppers and onion sandwich with sausage and a buffalo chicken cheese steak. You can make it as hot or mild as you like. I use this sandwich as dinner with soup and salad. A very satisfying meal. The amount of blue cheese depends on how messy or not you like your sandwich to be.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a skillet and tilt skillet to coat surface. Cook sausage slices in the heated skillet until nicely browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper to the sausages; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage mixture to a bowl.\nStir blue cheese dressing and hot sauce into the sausage mixture, assuring the sausage slices are coated in sauce.\nMake a bed of spinach in each hoagie roll. Top spinach with the sausage mixture.",
