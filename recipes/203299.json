    "des": "\"I have been trying for years to duplicate my favorite burrito from my favorite south Florida Mexican restaurant.  I started making it in casserole form and was pretty happy with this one, a combination of beans with a sweet and creamy sauce.  I have many variations of this, but this is the basic idea behind it. Serve with a side of chopped lettuce and tomatoes.\n\"",

Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nLine bottom of baking dish with 4 tortillas. To make the honey sauce, whisk together the mustard, sour cream, and 1/3 cup honey in a small bowl. Combine the red pepper, green pepper, garbanzo beans, black beans, and corn in a large bowl. Scoop out 1/2 cup of the bean mixture and reserve for topping.\nStir the chicken, 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, cumin, yellow rice, and honey sauce into the bean mixture. Mix well. Pour mixture into the baking dish. Top with 4 tortillas; sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, and the reserved 1/2 cup bean mixture.\nBake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes.
