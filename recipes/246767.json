    "des": "\"A simple Victoria 2-layer sponge. First cake I ever made. Spread buttercream on one layer, jam on the other, and sandwich them together. I also iced mine with a white marshmallow-type icing and decorated it, but that's not traditional or necessary - you can just sprinkle some sugar on top. I'm not an expert baker and tend not to measure my ingredients exactly so feel free to vary the ingredients.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nBeat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixture until creamy. Sift in flour. Add baking powder and vanilla; beat until well-blended. Add eggs; beat until batter is smooth. Divide batter between two 9-inch nonstick round pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until cake layers rise and turn golden, about 25 minutes. Invert onto wire racks and cool completely, about 30 minutes.",
