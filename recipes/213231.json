    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, crumble the bacon slices, and set aside.\nDrain all but 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings from the skillet, and cook and stir the onion in the skillet until the edges of the onion begin to turn brown. Set the onion aside.\nBring the water to a boil in a saucepan, and sprinkle in the couscous. Remove the pan from the heat, let stand for 5 minutes to absorb the water, then fluff the couscous with a fork. Allow couscous to cool.\nPlace the onion, cooled couscous, carrot, cucumber, red bell pepper, and garbanzos into a salad bowl, and stir lightly to combine.\nIn a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, white balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, curry powder, and salt and pepper until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the dressing over the salad, mix again lightly, and sprinkle with bacon bits.",
