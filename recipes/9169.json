    "des": "\"This recipe was graciously shared with me by a Jamaican friend, many years ago. It makes a delicious sauce, different from any other cranberry sauce I've ever tasted or made.  It does not \"gel\" but you do want to cook it long enough to make a good, thick consistency. You can use 1 tablespoon of excellent quality ground cinnamon instead of the cinnamon stick, if you prefer.  Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.\"",
    "ins": "Place the cranberries, grated orange rind, cinnamon, orange juice, brown sugar and enough water to cover cranberries in a saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat. Immediately turn heat down and simmer for about one hour or until the sauce has thickened. Taste for sweetness and adjust with additional sugar if necessary. You can not overcook, so continue cooking until you have a good thick consistency. Let mixture cool a bit then refrigerate in a covered container.",
