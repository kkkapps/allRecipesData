    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, cream together margarine, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt.  Add to egg mixture, and mix well. Stir in chocolate chips. Instead of just dropping them onto the cookie sheet, I roll the cookies into balls - it makes them all look very uniform and nice!\nBake in preheated oven for 12 to15 minutes, or until light brown. Cool on a wire rack.",
