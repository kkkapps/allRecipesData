    "des": "\"This recipe may sound weird to some people, but no matter who I make it for, they love it! Oh and it is a great time saver. It only takes 3 ingredients! Traditional eggs in a basket get an added touch by making French toast with the bread first, a quick and easy breakfast with extra protein.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk 4 eggs together in a bowl.\nCut 2-inch holes out of the center of each bread slice, reserving the cut-outs.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.\nDip bread into the whisked eggs, covering completely on both sides. Place each piece of dipped bread, 1 at a time, into the hot skillet; immediately crack an egg into the hole of the bread. Cook until egg is over-easy, about 1 minute per side.\nDip the bread cut-outs into the remaining whisked eggs and cook in the hot skillet until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Place the centers back into the center of each piece of bread to complete the top of the \"basket\".",
