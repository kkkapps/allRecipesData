    "des": "\"This is the recipe that my husband's grandmother made for her family, my mother-in-law made for hers, and I have inherited the fun of making this bread for mine.  We particularly like this fresh out of the oven, and then eat it daily for breakfast.  My father-in-law at 86 years old bragged about never having eaten a slice of 'store bought bread.'\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/2 cup warm water.\nBoil one medium peeled potato in 2 cups water with 1 teaspoon salt.  Mash the potato in a medium bowl, while reserving the water. Combine the mashed potato, potato water, 1/3 cup of sugar, shortening or oil, 1 tablespoon salt, and  milk in a large bowl.\nMake sure the milk mixture is warm, and add the yeast.   Stir in 15 cups of whole wheat flour.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for about 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface.  Cover with a damp cloth, and allow to rise until doubled.  Rising time will be about 1 1/2 hours.   Punch down, and knead again for 3 minutes.   Place back in bowl, and allow to rise again until doubled. The second rising period should be about 1 hour.  Punch down.  Form 4 loaves, and place into 9 x 5 inch greased bread pans.  Let dough rise again for 30 - 60 minutes.\nBake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour.",
