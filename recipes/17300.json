    "ins": "In separate bowls, prepare each pudding mix, using only one cup of milk per box. Let stand for about 5 minutes until slightly firm, then fold 1/2 of the whipped topping into each one.\nPlace a layer of graham crackers in the bottom of an 8x8 inch pan. Spread half of the chocolate pudding over them, then layer more graham crackers over the top. Spread half of the vanilla pudding over the crackers, then cover with more crackers. Repeat, alternating the chocolate and vanilla.\nChill at least 6 hours or overnight. This will cause the graham crackers to fluff up and taste like cake. Melt chocolate chips over a double boiler or in the microwave oven, then drizzle over the top. Cut into squares and serve.",
