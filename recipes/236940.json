    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and pour bacon drippings into a glass bowl. Crumble bacon.\nBeat eggs and banana in a bowl with an electric mixer until foamy and smooth. Beat 1 1/2 tablespoons bacon drippings, crumbled bacon pieces, and vanilla extract into egg mixture. Whisk coconut flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into egg mixture until batter is just combined. Let batter rest for 2 minutes.\nHeat a griddle over medium-high heat and lightly grease with bacon drippings. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
