You can also substitute the soda for a pitcher of powdered drink mix and 2 liters of ginger ale.\"",
    "ins": "Scoop all of sherbet into a large punch bowl.  Add pineapple juice and soda on top of the sherbet.  When adding soda the punch will foam, so make sure to stir constantly so the foam can go down. Serve immediately.",
