Generously butter a heavy 2 quart saucepan.\nDistribute popcorn evenly in prepared baking pans.  Place in oven to keep warm.\nIn prepared saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, sugar, gelatin, corn syrup and water.  Heat to 250 to 265 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.\nPour mixture evenly over popcorn and stir until coated.  Return popcorn to oven and bake 5 minutes; stir, then bake 5 minutes more.\nTurn popcorn out onto a large piece of foil.  Let rest until cool enough to handle, then form into balls.  Or let cool completely and break into clusters.  Store in an airtight container, in a cool, dry place.",
