    "des": "\"This is a traditional and simple Danish dish often served as the only item in the meal, along with Danish beer. There are many local Danish variations on the recipe. It hits the spot when you are recovering from a hangover, but does well at other times also, like cold winter evenings. For countless years, it has been a staple in the rural areas of Denmark, much like grits here in the South.\"",
