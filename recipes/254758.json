    "ins": "Pour root beer into a wide pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Stir in sugar until dissolved. Simmer until reduced by 1/3, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat; cool completely, about 30 minutes. Stir root beer flavoring into mixture. Pour root beer mixture into ice pop molds; freeze until firm, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.",
