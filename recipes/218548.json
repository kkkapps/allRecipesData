    "des": "\"The easiest dessert that everybody loves.  I got the idea from my mom and she got it from my grandma. The thing I changed is, I don't use a cake mix. I use items from my pantry, and I add blueberries.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch glass baking dish.\nPour peaches into the prepared dish, and sprinkle the blueberries over the peaches. In a bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, and baking powder until thoroughly combined. With a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour mixture to make a crumble, and spread the crumble mixture over the fruit.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow to cool; filling will thicken as it cools.",
