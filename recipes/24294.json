    "des": "\"This is an easy recipe for rum balls that can be made in a short amount of time and get better with age.  The strength of the rum determines if the kids get any or just the adults.  I've used regular rum, coconut flavored rum and 151 proof rum in this recipe and all work great.\"",

Stir in corn syrup and rum; mix well into a thick dough.\nCoat palms of hand with confectioners' sugar and roll dough into balls no larger than a quarter.  Place on a cookie sheet, foil or wax paper to dry.\nLet balls dry for 1 hour.  Roll in confectioners' sugar and seal in airtight containers.",
