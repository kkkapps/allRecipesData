    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Set a wire rack into a small baking dish.\nWrap each oyster with a slice of bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, paprika, and parsley; set onto wire rack.\nBake in the preheated oven until the bacon is crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately. They aren't as good once they get cold.",
