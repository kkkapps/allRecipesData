    "ins": "Slice the pear in half lengthwise, core, remove the stem, and set each half on a plate with the cut side down. This is the body of the turkey. Cut 2 raisins in half to make 4 eyes, and set the eyes onto the narrower part of the pear. Cut a small slice from one end of the 2 remaining raisins, and stick a raisin below the eyes to make beaks. Press a broken piece of walnut, bumpy side up, into each pear below the beaks to make wattles.\nTrim the dried apricots into 4 feet with 3 fat toes, and place two feet at the bottom of each pear. Arrange apple wedges alternating with grapefruit sections in a fan shape around the top of the turkey, for feathers.",
