    "des": "\"Homemade peach cobbler with fresh-picked peaches baked in a cast iron skillet. Serve with your favorite ice cream, (my husband loves pecan pralines and cream).  I made this recipe up because I was ready to be finished with the peaches! LOL! You can use any baking type dish you like. It was old fashioned and baked nicely in the cast iron skillet.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nStir peaches with lemon juice in a bowl to prevent fruit from browning. Transfer to a cast iron skillet and stir in 1 1/2 cup white sugar, pecans, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Bring to a soft boil, stirring often.\nWhisk self-rising flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl. Stir melted butter into the mixture (batter should resemble cooked oatmeal). Spoon batter over hot peach filling in the skillet; dot topping with 2 tablespoons of butter pieces and sprinkle with raw sugar.\nBake cobbler in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.",
