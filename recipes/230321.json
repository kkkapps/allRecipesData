    "des": "\"Got this recipe from a roommate and have received countless compliments in dinner groups. When I'm cooking for dinner group (a lot of people), sometimes I use a 16-ounce bottle Italian dressing with an 18-ounce jar of apricot jam.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until  rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken breasts on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.\nCombine apricot jam, Italian-style salad dressing, and dried onions together in a bowl. Place browned chicken in a baking dish and pour jam mixture over the chicken; bake for 15 minutes. Add the pineapple, chopped onion and chopped red bell pepper; continue baking until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside, another 15 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.",
