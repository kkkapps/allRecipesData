    "ins": "Mix all-purpose flour, corn flour, and baking soda in a shallow bowl. Stir enough milk into the flour mixture to make a somewhat-thin batter that will stick to the candy bars, but not drip off.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDip the candy bars in the batter to coat.\nCarefully put coated candy bar into hot oil and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.",
