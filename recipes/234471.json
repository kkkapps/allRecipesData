    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.\nPlace bread cubes in the prepared baking dish.\nBeat cream-style corn, milk, eggs, and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until evenly combined; pour over bread cubes. Pour melted butter over bread cube mixture. Place dish on a baking sheet and pour enough water into the baking sheet to make a water bath around baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until pudding is set in the middle, about 1 hour.",
