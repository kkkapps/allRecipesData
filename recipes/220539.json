    "ins": "Combine 4 cups water, wine, 2 tbsp. Old Bay, and 1 tbsp. salt in a 10\" skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat.\nAdd salmon skin side down, turn off the heat, cover, and let salmon cook gently in the hot liquid for 10 minutes.\nUsing a metal spatula, transfer salmon to a plate skin side up and let cool. (The salmon should still be rare in the middle.)\nPeel off and discard salmon skin. Break salmon into small pieces and places pieces in a large bowl.\nAdd the remaining Old Bay and salt along with the bread crumbs, Melt(R), scallions, onions, eggs, and lemon juice. Stir ingredients until just combined and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.\nSpoon some of the salmon mixture into a 1/3-cup measuring cup and gently pack it with your hands. Unmold and press gently with your hand to form a 2\"-wide patty; transfer patty to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Repeat to make 12 patties. Refrigerate patties for at least 1 hour or overnight.\nAdd oil to a 12\" cast-iron skillet until it reaches a depth of 1/2\". Heat over medium-high heat until oil registers 325 degrees  on a deep-fry thermometer. Using a metal spatula, gently transfer half of the patties to skillet and cook, flipping once with the spatula, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer cakes to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat with remaining patties.",
