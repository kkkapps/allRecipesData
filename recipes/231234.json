    "des": "\"This is an elegant twist to an already elegant dish. This baked brie combines the strong but coordinating flavors of brie cheese with pesto sauce and pine nuts. It has a sweet taste and can be eaten alone or served with crackers or baked French bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCut Brie cheese horizontally in half, creating two equal rounds similar to a layered cake. Spread pesto sauce on the cut surface of 1 half; sprinkle pine nuts and brown sugar over pesto layer. Place the other Brie half on top of pesto mixture.\nSeparate crescent rolls and cover entire Brie round with crescent roll dough, sealing all the gaps. Place covered Brie on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until Brie cheese is softened and crescent rolls are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.",
