    "des": "\"I'm always looking to do something new since my wife and daughter turned vegetarian. She brought home some fresh picked portobellos from work so I made them into burgers and had some tomatoes to use up, which I made into bruschetta topping, and thus this burger was born.\"",
    "ins": "Mix roma tomatoes, basil, Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, garlic, olive oil, kosher salt, and black pepper in a bowl and refrigerate to blend flavors, 1 to 2 hours.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nGrill portobello mushrooms with gill sides up on an upper rack of the grill until juicy and hot, about 15 minutes. Spoon tomato mixture into mushroom caps to cover entire cap. Continue grilling until topping is heated through, another 15 to 20 minutes. Top with horseradish Cheddar cheese if desired; grill until cheese has melted, 1 to 2 more minutes. Serve on kaiser rolls.",
