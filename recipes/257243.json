    "des": "\"Hey its Carla Bruno from CarlasCakes! Here is another great recipe I had to share with you. I am obsessed with banana bread and so it my husband, and I am also obsessed with Lotus Cookie Butter! If you don't know what that is yet, I strongly suggest you become familiar because I am telling you, it is the best thing ever! There are lots of different types of cookie butters. However, I love Lotus because it has a caramel taste to it.\"",
