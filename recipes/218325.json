    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nMix the cooked turkey, refried beans, pumpkin puree, and taco seasoning in a bowl. Pour tomato sauce into a blender, and add chipotle pepper and chicken bouillon granules; blend until smooth, about 30 seconds.\nLay a tortilla out onto a work surface, and generously spoon turkey filling in a line down the middle of the tortilla. Fold a top and bottom flap of the tortilla towards the middle, and fold the sides inward to enclose the filling. Lay the enchilada, seam side down, into the baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Pour the sauce over the filled tortillas, and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.",
