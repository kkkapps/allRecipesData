    "des": "\"This scone recipe is quick to make using a food processor and they are every bit as good as fancy bakery scones. You'll love them with tea! Variations: dried cranberries, blueberries, or raisins can be substituted for currants.\"",
    "ins": "Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a food processor. Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles oatmeal. Transfer to a bowl.\nStir cream into flour mixture until just combined. Fold currants into dough. Transfer dough to a sheet of plastic wrap; fold to completely cover dough. Shape dough into a 1-inch thick disk and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon mat.\nUnwrap dough and cut into 8 wedges. Arrange wedges on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.",
