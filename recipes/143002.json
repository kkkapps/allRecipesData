    "ins": "Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Place the potatoes and carrots in the boiling water, and cook until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the peas and corn to the boiling water, and turn off the heat. Wait 1 minute, and drain the vegetables. Cover to keep warm.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onions, and cook until the onions are transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Combine the tomatoes, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, and water with the onions. Stir in the turmeric, chili powder, cumin, coriander, and mustard seed until blended. Season with salt to taste. Add the potatoes, carrots, peas, and corn. Turn the heat to high, and cook the vegetables 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat to medium, and cook another 7 minutes.\nPour the coconut milk into the vegetable mixture. Stir and cook for just 3 minutes to prevent the milk from curdling or separating. Remove from the heat and serve.",
