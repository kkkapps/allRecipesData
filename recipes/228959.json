    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. When cooled, chop the bacon.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSeparate biscuits and pull each biscuit into halves. Press 2 biscuit halves into a muffin cup, molding the dough to the inside to make a dough cup. Repeat with remaining dough to make 12 biscuit cups.\nWhisk eggs and milk together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Spoon each biscuit cup about half full of egg mixture and top with about 1 tablespoon bacon and about 1 1/2 teaspoon Cheddar cheese per biscuit.\nBake in the preheated oven until the biscuit crust is browned, the cheese is melted and bubbling, and the egg center is set, about 20 minutes.",
