    "ins": "To Make Filling: Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until golden. Add the pork and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook the pork, crumbling with a fork, for about 10 minutes. Stir in the rosemary. Remove mixture from skillet with a slotted spoon and remove all but 2 tablespoons of the pork fat.\nLay the chicken breasts flat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon equal amounts of the pork mixture onto each breast, and roll each one up tightly. Secure each roll with 2 toothpicks.\nHeat the skillet with the reserved pork fat over medium high heat until almost smoking. Saute chicken on one side for 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown. Turn over. Turn heat to medium and saute chicken until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.",
