    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil; brush with olive oil.\nSeason chicken breasts with mesquite seasoning and place in the prepared baking dish.\nMix cheese blend, bacon bits, green onions, mayonnaise, and chipotle-flavored hot sauce together in a small bowl. Spread mixture evenly over chicken.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 16 minutes. Turn off oven; leave chicken inside for 2 minutes. Turn on broiler; broil chicken on low until topping is golden, 2 to 3 minutes.",
