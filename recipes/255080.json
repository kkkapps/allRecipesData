    "des": "\"I was looking to try someone else's recipe for pork neck bones, but when I didn't find one I decided to add my own. A Southern keep-you-warm recipe that's great for the fall and winter or making a dollar stretch. My family loves it over rice with collard greens, corn bread, and candied yams.\"",
    "ins": "Place pork neck bones in a large bowl; season with black pepper, adobo seasoning, and thyme. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 1 hour.\nFill a large stockpot halfway with water. Add cooking wine, vinegar, cilantro, basil, onions, green bell peppers, and garlic. Cover and bring to a boil. Add pork neck bones. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.\nStir potatoes into the pot. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until neck bones and potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more.",
