    "ins": "Lay 1 sandwich wrap on a work surface. Spread 1 ounce ricotta cheese over the wrap, covering about 2/3 of the surface and leaving 1 end without ricotta. Top ricotta cheese layer with prosciutto. Spread about 1 tablespoon pesto over prosciutto. Carefully roll the wrap around the filling, starting with the covered end. You may need to tug on the ends of the prosciutto to take up slack. The uncovered end of the bread is to account for this. Repeat with remaining ingredients.\nRefrigerate wraps until chilled, about 1 hour. Slice wraps into 1/2-inch-thick pieces and lay on a bed of Parmesan cheese.",
