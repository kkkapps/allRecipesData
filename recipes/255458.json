Add shallot and garlic; cook and stir until shallot is wilted, about 5 minutes.\nPlace mushrooms, gill side up, into the skillet. Cook, flipping once, until liquid is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Return mushrooms to gill side up.\nArrange green beans around the mushrooms. Pour in wine; simmer until absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low; cover. Cook until mushrooms release their juices and green beans are tender, about 10 minutes.\nTop mushrooms with ham slices; sprinkle evenly with Gruy\u00c3\u00a8re cheese. Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the green beans.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5 minutes.",
