    "des": "\"Sweet 'n smoky bacon eggplant slices baked in crispy little strips. The process is easy... Great to add as a bacon replacement to pretty much everything (BLT, club sandwich, etc). You can break into little pieces and add to a spinach salad, Caesar salad, on baked potatoes, or in soup!\"",
