    "des": "\"This is a fabulous recipe for a light and flavorful pasta dish that's full of veggies. The mixture of anchovies and garlic creates an amazing flavor and aroma, and the crushed red pepper flakes add a nice kick. This recipe can handle as much garlic as you like, so push it to the limit.\"",

Add anchovies and water, cover, and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in green onions, tomatoes, and parsley, cover again, simmering until vegetables are soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.\nWhile the vegetables are cooking, bring a large pot of water and one teaspoon of olive oil to a boil. Add linguine and cook until al dente, about 7 to 8 minutes; drain. Toss with anchovy mixture and crushed red pepper flakes. If desired, season with black pepper. Serve immediately.",
