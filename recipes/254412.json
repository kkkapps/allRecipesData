    "des": "\"I love cheesecake, but sometimes feel guilty about eating it... or even thinking about it. So I decided to replace the cream cheese with Greek yogurt and went with coconut because it's one of my favorite flavors. This one doesn't make me feel as guilty to eat. I top mine with drizzles of dark chocolate and toasted coconut shavings.\"",
