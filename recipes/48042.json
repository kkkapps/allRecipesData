    "des": "\"I like to snack on these muffins, they're good, and they're healthy too. Add more sugar if you want it to be sweeter, since these muffins aren't very sweet. Be careful with the milk, sometimes it can be too moist, but you'll just have to bake it for a longer period of time.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, combine bran and buttermilk. Set aside to soak for 10 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease muffin pan, or use paper liners.\nIn a large bowl, mix together flour, brown sugar and baking soda. Stir in bran mixture and egg whites. Fold in grated apple. Divide batter into 12 muffin cups.\nBake in preheated oven for 16 to 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before removing from the pan.",
