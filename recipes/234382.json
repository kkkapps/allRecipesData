    "des": "\"If you live in Philadelphia, or have visited, you have probably gone to the famous Pat's or Geno's Steaks. When you order, you have to order a 'Whiz Wit' or a 'Whiz Wit-out.' This means a cheese steak with Cheeze Whiz\u00c2\u00ae and with or without fried onions. This is a cheese steak in a dip. Perfect for tailgating or football games and is best served in a slow cooker with cut-up hoagie/sub rolls. Enjoy!\"",
