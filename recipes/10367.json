Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and ginger; stir into the batter to make a soft dough. Add more flour if needed. Cover the bowl and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour, or until firm.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness on a floured surface. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. Place cookies onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cookies appear dry in the center.",
