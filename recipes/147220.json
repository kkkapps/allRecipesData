    "des": "\"This recipe is simplified using boxed cake mix.  It becomes delicately moist and rich, spiked with a hint of coffee-flavored liqueur. It's amazing, with pockets of melted chocolate chips and a ribbon of vanilla cream. Ideal served with whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon, or vanilla bean ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a Bundt pan.\nCombine 1/2 package of vanilla pudding mix with 1 cup of milk in a bowl, and set aside.\nPlace 1/2 package of vanilla pudding mix, cake mix, vegetable oil, eggs, 1 cup of milk, cinnamon, coffee liqueur, and 1 tablespoon instant coffee granules into a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until just combined, about 30 seconds, then beat on high for 2 minutes. Gently fold in the chocolate chips.\nPour half the batter into the prepared cake pan. Spoon the vanilla pudding in an even layer over the top of the batter, sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon of instant coffee granules, and cover with the rest of the batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 5 minutes, and invert onto a plate. Cool for 5 more minutes, and dust with confectioners' sugar.",
