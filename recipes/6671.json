    "ins": "Combine oats, molasses, oil, salt and boiling water. Let cool to about 105 degrees F.\nDissolve the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until creamy. Stir the yeast into oat mixture and mix well. Add whole wheat flour, 2 cups bread flour, and the eggs. Mix until well combined.\nStir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out to a floured counter and knead for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a well-greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 3 regular loaf pans and 4 mini loaf pans.\nTransfer the dough onto a floured surface and divide it into 4 pieces. Shape the dough into loaves and place them in the pans, seam-side down. Let rise until doubled, about 90 minutes. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes.",
