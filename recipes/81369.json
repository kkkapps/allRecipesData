    "des": "\"Juicy, warm chicken breasts baked in a crunchy pecan and garlic flavored coating sit on a bed of crisp romaine lettuce. Dried cranberries and mandarin oranges add a sweetness that is balanced by the tanginess of crumbled blue cheese. Ranch dressing ties the dish together to make a wonderfully light, filling salad.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace the creamy garlic dressing and pecans in separate bowls. Dip each chicken breast in the dressing then in the pecans to coat. Arrange chicken on a baking sheet.\nBake chicken 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until juices run clear. Cool slightly, and cut into strips.\nOn serving plates, arrange equal amounts of the lettuce, mandarin oranges, cranberries, and blue cheese. Top with equal amounts chicken, and serve with Ranch dressing.",
