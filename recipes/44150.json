    "des": "\"Perhaps one of the most celebrated Mexican fish dishes, this snapper recipe comes from the pretty seacoast town for which it was named.  Use red snapper or rockfish.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green pepper, onion, and garlic, and cook until pepper is soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in the white pepper, cinnamon, lime juice, olives, and chiles; cook for 2 more minutes, to blend the flavors. Stir in the tomatoes, and cook until thickened, about 10 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the snapper filets into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour the tomato sauce over the filets, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Stir in the capers just before serving.",
