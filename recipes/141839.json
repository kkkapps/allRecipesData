    "ins": "Grease a shallow, microwave-safe plate or baking dish. Set aside.\nWhisk together the egg and broth in a large bowl. Gradually stir in the flour and oats. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut out cookies using a round cookie cutter. Use a smaller round cookie cutter to cut out the center hole. Place on prepared plate, arranging the cookies on the dish without crowding them.\nCover with a paper towel, and cook in the microwave on high until firm, about 10 minutes. Repeat steps to use up the remaining dough. Cool on a wire rack.",
