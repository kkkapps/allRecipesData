    "des": "\"My grandfather came from Hungary when he was three. My grandmother made this recipe for a taste of home for him. It is Americanized, but still delicious. He added sour cream to his, while we kids we ate it plain. The consistency grandma made was like a casserole or stew rather than a soup.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.\nSeason beef with paprika, black pepper, and seasoned salt. Stir tomato sauce and tomato paste into the beef mixture until smooth. Pour water over the beef; add macaroni and stir.\nBring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer mixture, adding water as needed to maintain your desired consistency, until the macaroni is tender yet firm to the bit, about 20 minutes. Adjust seasoning before serving.",
