    "des": "\"Looking at the mound of carrot pulp from my juicer and then at my 2-1/2-year-old daughter (who loves bread) inspired me to experiment... This muffin is dense, healthy, and can be tweaked to suit your tastes. As is, it is not sweet, but you could certainly add mashed ripe banana or pineapple. Once out of the oven, sprinkle the tops with cinnamon sugar while they are still hot.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.\nMix carrot pulp, applesauce, eggs, and brown sugar together in a bowl.\nMix spelt flour, oats, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and ginger together in a separate bowl.\nCombine carrot pulp and flour mixtures until batter is blended and thick. Fold in walnuts and raisins.\nSpoon batter into the prepared muffin tin. Press down and fill each cup to the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.",
