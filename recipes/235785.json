    "des": "\"I like blended and frozen drinks, so after trying the limited edition Kahlua\u00c2\u00ae pumpkin spice holiday flavor I decided to see what I could come up with. It is delicious! Please use heavy whipping cream. It is available in small pint-sized containers. It is not much, but it adds a necessary creaminess to the drink texture. The pumpkin puree also adds to the pumpkin flavor. Feel free to garnish as desired with additional pumpkin spice, whipped cream, or both. Enjoy!\"",
