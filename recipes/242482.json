    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.\nHeat coconut oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir rice 1 minute. Add coconut milk and stir to combine. Increase heat and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Cover and cook 35 minutes. Cover; remove from heat. Let sit 10 minutes.\nFluff rice with a fork. Stir in the lime zest, lime juice, and salt to taste. Cover and keep warm.\nCut tortillas into 1/4-inch strips. Place strips on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until crisp, about 30 minutes.\nTo char peppers, hold jalapeno pepper with tongs and hold over the flame of a gas stove or directly on the burner of an electric stove, turning about every 30 seconds. Continue until all sides are charred, about 5 minutes. Immediately place pepper in a small ziptop plastic bag and seal shut. Repeat with second pepper. Allow peppers to return to room temperature, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the skin. Cut off stem, remove seeds (if desired), and dice.\nSpray nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium-high heat. Cook and stir corn until it begins to brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer corn to a bowl.\nHeat oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, chili powder, and cumin. Cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in beans and corn and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.\nPlace rice in the bottom of a bowl; top with chicken mixture, chopped tomatoes, and a dollop of sour cream. Serve with tortilla strips.",
