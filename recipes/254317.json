    "des": "\"After a boxed brownie mix languished in my cupboard for some time, I decided to turn it into something I knew my tennis-playing son would eat. This recipe arose from comparing a brownie recipe with a muffin recipe, and adding the differences to the mix. To finish, I simply sprinkled powdered sugar over the tops, but I'm sure other toppings would be great as well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with liners.\nWhisk buttermilk, bananas, and eggs together in a bowl; gradually stir in coconut oil.\nCombine brownie mix, oats, all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in buttermilk mixture. Stir together until batter is just moistened.\nDivide batter among muffin liners, filling each 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pan, 10 to 15 minutes. Move to a rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.",
