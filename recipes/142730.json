    "des": "\"This is great for using up that extra rhubarb! It's a very kicky twist on a Cosmopolitan, and you can use the syrup to add a spark to any of your favorite drinks, from vodka lemonade to margaritas. The syrup makes enough for 12 cocktails, so invite your friends over!\"",
    "ins": "To make the rhubarb syrup, place sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Lower heat to medium, and stir the rhubarb into the syrup. Simmer until rhubarb is softened and stringy, 5 to 7 minutes. Press out the juice with a spoon while straining syrup through cheesecloth or strainer into a glass jar or bottle. Discard rhubarb solids. Cool, and refrigerate syrup until needed.\nTo make a 'Barbtini, combine the vodka, 2 tablespoons rhubarb syrup, and triple sec in a shaker with ice. Shake until the outside of shaker is frosty. Strain into a martini glass.",
