    "ins": "Combine the tomatoes, onion, green chiles, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, salt, and hot sauce in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-low heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the salsa reaches your preferred consistency, about 3 hours. Store in refrigerator until using.",
