    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nRub chicken breast halves with salt and pepper. Place on the prepared grill. Cook 10 to 15 minutes on each side, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from heat, set aside, and keep warm.\nHeat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic for about 1 minute. Mix in ginger and mangos, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, until mangos are tender. Pour in the cider vinegar and white wine. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in cilantro, and remove from heat. Spoon over the grilled chicken to serve.",
