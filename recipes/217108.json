    "des": "\"Inspired by the wonderful spices and flavors used in Moroccan cuisine, this wonderful stew is a hearty one-dish meal. We like to double the recipe and freeze one portion for later. You can also save time, by combining all of these Moroccan spices in bulk and having the mixture on hand to use in this stew recipe, as well as others, like lamb burgers, grilled salmon, and meat rubs. We typically serve the stew with warm bread and a salad.\"",
    "ins": "Combine cinnamon, cumin, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, turmeric, curry powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in the ground lamb. For most flavorful results, allow mixture to rest, refrigerated, overnight.\nMelt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the onion in the butter until soft and just beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix the spiced lamb mixture to the onions. Cook and stir until meat is browned, about 5 minutes.\nPour the beef broth, chicken broth, and consomme into the pot.  Stir in the tomatoes, honey, carrots, sweet potatoes, garbanzo beans, dried apricots and lentils. Bring to boil; reduce heat to low.\nSimmer stew for 30 minutes or until the vegetables and lentils are cooked and tender. Season with black pepper to taste.",
