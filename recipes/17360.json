Cover and microwave on high for 10 minutes, stirring after 5 minutes.\nStir in chocolate until it is melted, then add chicken pieces, coating each piece with mole sauce. Cover and microwave on high for about 30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear (meat will be starting to fall away from the bone).
