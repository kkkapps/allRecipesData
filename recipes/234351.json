    "des": "\"This recipe includes everything you need for a sushi dinner party for about 10 people. It Includes California rolls, Boston Rolls, Lobster rolls, tempura eggplant and avocado rolls, pesto and egg rolls, and shrimp and asparagus rolls (we did not include any raw ingredients, since our people are a bit squeamish and reluctant to eat anything raw). Mix and match the fillings, as desired. Serve with pickled ginger, wasabi paste, and soy sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Remove pot from heat and keep covered for 10 minutes.\nStir 5 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave until vinegar mixture is warmed, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir well. Add vinegar mixture to rice and toss thoroughly to coat each grain of rice; cool completely.\nHeat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook eggs in hot oil until firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate and cut into strips.\nHeat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sake, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry eggplant in oil mixture until softened and lightly charred, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer eggplant to a paper towel-lined plate.\nMix carrot, 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce together in a microwave-safe bowl; microwave until carrot is softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add asparagus and cook until bright green, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and immediately immerse asparagus in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain.\nCut avocado into 8 slices and drizzle lemon juice over slices in a bowl.\nLay nori sheets on a flat work surface, wet hands, and spread 3/4 to 1 cup rice onto each sheet. Press rice into a thin layer, leaving 1/2-inch exposed nori on 1 long side.\nFor California rolls, layer crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and carrot atop one another in a thin strip along the edge opposite the uncovered edge on 3 nori sheets.\nFor eggplant and avocado rolls, layer eggplant and avocado atop one another in a thin strip along the edge opposite the uncovered edge on 3 nori sheets.\nFor pesto and egg rolls, spread pesto in a thin strip along the edge opposite the uncovered edge and top with egg slices on 3 nori sheets.\nFor shrimp and asparagus rolls, layer shrimp and asparagus atop one another in a thin strip along the edge opposite the uncovered edge on 3 nori sheets.\nTransfer 1 prepared nori to a bamboo sushi mat. Use the mat to roll the nori and rice around the filling toward the exposed nori edge, squeezing gently. Wet the exposed nori edge and seal the roll. Slice each roll into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining prepared nori.",
