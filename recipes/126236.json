    "des": "\"This was originally for T-bone steaks but it works just as nicely with deer.  The rub helps minimize the 'gamey' taste and the butter just makes them delicious.\"",

Transfer the butter mixture onto a large piece of plastic wrap, gently wrap and form the butter into a log. Freeze until ready to use.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat.\nMix together the steak seasoning and ancho chile powder in a small bowl. Rub the seasoning blend onto both sides of the venison steaks.\nGrill the steaks to preferred doneness, 5 to 8 minutes per side for medium. Top each steak with a slice of the lemon-cilantro butter to serve.",
