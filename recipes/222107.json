    "des": "\"This will definitely be the biggest hit at the party! This is such an easy appetizer to make and it tastes just like the jalapeno poppers you wish you could make yourself! We use light mayonnaise and light cream cheese, less Parmesan, and added cilantro to make this recipe healthier. But remember, it's only healthier if you don't eat it all by yourself! Serve with sliced sourdough baguettes, tortilla chips or crackers.\"",
