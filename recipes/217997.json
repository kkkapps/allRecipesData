    "des": "\"Yellow squash made easy, and put to the side to keep warm so you can tend to other parts of the dinner. It is easy and delicious. Don't use too much cheese; you want to taste the wonderful flavor of the yellow or summer squash!\"",
    "ins": "Place the squash and onion into a pot, and pour in enough water just to cover. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, and simmer the vegetables until tender, about 10 minutes. Do not stir. Drain the squash and onion in a colander set in the sink.\nGently layer the cooked squash and onions, cubes of butter, and cheese food cubes in a slow cooker. Set the cooker on Low, and cook until the squash are very tender and the butter and cheese have formed a creamy sauce, about 1 hour. Do not stir.",
