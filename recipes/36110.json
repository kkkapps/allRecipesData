    "ins": "Combine ground beef, smoked sausage, onion, celery, and garlic in a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until beef is evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage, tomatoes, water, and rice. Season with garlic salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring once, until rice is tender, 35 to 40 minutes.",
