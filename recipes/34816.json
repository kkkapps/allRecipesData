    "des": "\"A sin-free, delicious, and fruity version of the ever-popular carrot cake. The flax seed meal may be omitted, but it can easily be found in health food stores. This cake is best served chilled because of its moist quality.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly oil a 9x5 inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray.\nWhisk together the egg whites, sugar, milk, applesauce, vanilla, and almond extract in a small bowl; mix until well blended.  In a large bowl, sift together the flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and baking soda.  Mix the egg into the flour; stir until well blended.  Fold in the walnuts, raisins, carrot, and drained pineapple.  Pour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (but not necessarily dry), about 40 minutes.  Set aside to cool for 10 to 20 minutes before refrigerating overnight.",
