    "des": "\"This different pork flavor is delicious served over rice and has always been met with praise.  The spices in the marinade can stain, so I use a metal bowl to do the marinating in (also wear an apron!).  DO TRY!\"",
    "ins": "Place pork into a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix together  the vinegar, cumin, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Pour over the pork, and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Remove pork from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and place in the hot skillet. Cook until nicely browned on the outside. Add orange juice, 1/2 cup water, dried onion, and the reserved marinade. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the pork is fork tender.\nIn a small cup, stir together the flour and 2 tablespoons of water. Stir into the skillet, and simmer uncovered until thickened, 2 to 4 minutes.",
