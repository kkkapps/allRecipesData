Traditionally made with white wine, this recipe uses beer for a robust-flavored taste. Celery and carrot slices and cauliflower florets are also delicious dipped into the creamy cheese mixture.\"",
    "ins": "Toss Emmentaler cheese, Gruyere cheese, cornstarch, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.\nPour beer into a heavy pot over medium-low heat; bring to a simmer until gently warmed, about 5 minutes.\nStir cheese mixture into simmering beer in small amounts, assuring each addition melts fully into the mixture and that the mixture has returned to a simmer before adding the next batch, 10 to 15 minutes total.\nStir mustard into the cheese mixture and remove pot from heat. Taste fondue and adjust seasonings to taste. Pour fondue into a fondue dish. Serve with the baguette.",
