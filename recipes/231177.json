    "des": "\"Breakfasts have always been a challenge for me, so I created this recipe as a quick and portable way to have healthy breakfasts all week. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Feel free to experiment with different dried fruits and flavorings to your taste. I imagine that adding quinoa, hemp protein, flax seed or other nutritional supplements would taste great.\"",
