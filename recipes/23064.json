    "des": "\"This recipe comes from my friend who is a guide in Alaska - it's excellent for sandwiches, on rolls with sharp Cheddar cheese. Yum yum!  Slow cooked in a slow cooker so even the toughest of roasts or stew meats will work; eventually the meat just falls apart! Also good served over hot cooked rice. Delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove from skillet,  crumble and set aside. Brown stew meat in bacon grease for flavor.\nPut onion, sugar, vinegar, cumin, chili powder, garlic, mustard, ketchup, salt and pepper in slow cooker and mix well. Add bacon and venison and stir together.\nCook for a minimum of 8 hours on Low setting. Use a fork to separate the meat into a thick and yummy Sloppy Joe-style barbecue.",
