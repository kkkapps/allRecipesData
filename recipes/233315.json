    "des": "\"This very easy recipe uses two pans and has 'pantry' written all over it. It tastes like what you would expect if Hormel\u00c2\u00ae and Chef Boyardee\u00c2\u00ae shared a kitchen. Perfect for kids. Substitute the cavatappi with any full-bodied pasta, such as bow-tie, wagon-wheel, or mostaccioli.  You can even sneak in some frozen corn for a little tex-mex feel. Top it with cheese when serving.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a large pot; add salt. Pour cavatappi into the boiling water and cook until tender but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes; drain and rinse cavatappi.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened and transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and stir ground beef into onion mixture. Cook and stir until ground beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease and return skillet to heat.\nMix tomato sauce, chili powder, and cumin into ground beef mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato sauce is heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir cavatappi into meat sauce until evenly coated; add black beans and pepper. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.",
