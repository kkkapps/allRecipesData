    "des": "\"Simple rice and salmon dish I thought up on the way home from school today. When I get around to going grocery shopping I will try it with fresh veggies! Not too gourmet, but quick and nutritious.\"",
    "ins": "Rinse the rice. In a saucepan bring the vegetable broth to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the onion, salmon, mixed vegetables, lemon pepper and herb seasoning. Mix thoroughly.  Grease an 11x7 inch baking dish with the olive oil.\nWhen rice is done, mix it in with the salmon mixture. Mix thoroughly. Press into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle the bread crumbs and paprika on top.\nCover with foil and bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes.",
