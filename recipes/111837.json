    "des": "\"A very delicious Finnish flatbread made with wheat and rye flours. Cream of rye cereal can be used in place of the rye flour if coarse ground is not available. This recipe makes 4 to 5 flatbreads.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.\nStir in the salt, whole wheat flour and rye flour. Mix in the bread flour 1 cup at a time until the dough is not sticky. Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl, turning to coat. Set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nPunch down the dough and divide into 4 or 5 portions. Form each one into a ball, and let rise again until doubled, about 20 minutes.\nPlace each ball onto a baking sheet and flatten out into an oval 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Poke holes all over using the tines of a fork. Let  rise again until doubled, 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until browned on the top and bottom. Brush the tops with butter while still warm.",
