    "des": "\"I'm not allergic to gluten but since I feel so much better when I don't eat it I tried many great, healthy, and gluten-free recipes. Everybody asks about this recipe and can't believe it's made from millet and buckwheat; even picky kids like it. It's really easy and healthy, give it a try! You can add flax seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and whatever seeds and nuts you like to this bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Generously grease a loaf pan with butter.\nGrind buckwheat and millet in a food processor until very fine. Add sunflower seeds, chia seeds, baking soda, and salt; pulse in the processor until incorporated. With the processor on, slowly pour buttermilk into buckwheat mixture until a thick dough forms. Stir prunes into dough, transfer dough to prepared loaf pan, and cover the loaf pan with parchment paper.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 390 degrees F (199 degrees C), remove parchment paper from the loaf pan, and continue baking until bread is crusty but still soft on the inside, about 45 minutes more.",
