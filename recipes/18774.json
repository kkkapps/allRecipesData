    "ins": "Season venison steaks with pepper and salt. Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat; skim off solids (the 'milky' substance that forms) and discard. Transfer butter to a large skillet and heat over high heat.\nSaute venison steaks in skillet for about 3 minutes each side, then reduce heat to medium and cook for about 10 minutes each side for rare steaks, 15 minutes each side for medium. Remove from heat and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes before slicing into long strips. Serve immediately.",
