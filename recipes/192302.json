    "des": "\"A great Southern okra dish that allegedly comes from the heart of Acadiana. This vegetable dish is heavy enough to serve as a main dish and makes one pine for the fiddles and chicory coffee.\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter and olive oil over medium heat in a large pot. Cook and stir celery and onions until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the corn kernels and cook for 3 minutes.\nStir in okra, tomatoes, andouille sausage, and Creole seasoning; cover and cook over medium heat until the okra has lost all of its slippery texture, at least 45 minutes. Season with sea salt, black pepper, and more Creole seasoning if necessary. Cook, uncovered, to reduce liquid, about 10 minutes.",
