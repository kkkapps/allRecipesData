Grease and flour a loaf pan.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar.\nIn a 1-cup (or larger) measuring cup combine juice and zest of the orange, butter and enough boiling water to reach 3/4 cup.  Stir into flour mixture.  Fold in egg, walnuts and cranberries.  Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.\nTo make the icing combine confectioners' sugar, butter, orange juice and milk; add more milk if necessary so that the icing is thin and slightly runny.  Drizzle over bread; allow icing to set before slicing.",
