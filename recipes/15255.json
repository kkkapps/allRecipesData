    "ins": "In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, confectioners' sugar and pecans. Make a well in the center and pour in the orange juice concentrate, corn syrup and melted butter. Mix well by hand until dough forms. Roll into 1 inch balls and roll the balls in confectioners' sugar. Store at room temperature in an airtight container. Put a sheet of waxed paper between layers to prevent sticking.",
