    "des": "\"I went to a great restaurant in Savannah one summer and had red beans and rice.  When I came home, I tried to figure out just how they made it.  I haven't figured it out exactly, but this recipe is a pretty good imitation. Serve with hot white rice, fried potatoes, and cornbread if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage and onion and saute until onions are translucent. Add bell pepper, garlic, parsley, paprika, cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Saute all together, stirring occasionally, until bell pepper is a little tender (about 10 minutes).\nDrain and rinse kidney beans. Add all kidney beans, tomatoes and chile peppers. Stir to mix together, reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Add salt to taste while simmering. Serve hot.",
