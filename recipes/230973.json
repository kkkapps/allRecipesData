Season drained beef with taco seasoning.\nPress refrigerated dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread refried beans in an even layer onto the dough. Spread sour cream into a layer atop the refried beans. Sprinkle ground beef evenly over the sour cream; top with salsa and Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly and crust has browned, 25 to 30 minutes.",
