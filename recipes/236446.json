    "des": "\"This is one of my kids' favorite recipes! I could make this five times in a row and they'd never get tired of it. It's easy to make and a real quick, hot meal for those busy nights. I will add cheese on top of the sandwiches or warm the rolls in the oven. I occasionally add mild banana peppers on top for my husband since he is a fan of spicy things.\"",
