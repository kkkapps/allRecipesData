    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDrain one can of the mixed vegetables and pour both cans into a 2 quart casserole dish (one with a lid, preferably).  Pour cream of celery soup over vegetables (use only one can for a drier casserole); gently stir until well mixed.  Spread fried onions over vegetables and then spread the stuffing on top of the onions.  Pour melted butter over stuffing; cover dish with a lid or with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Cool for a few minutes before serving.",
