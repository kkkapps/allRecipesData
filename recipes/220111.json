    "des": "\"This is a spicy sauce similar to etouffee. By adding seafood, it becomes Seafood Creole. Due to the seasoning mix, it is quite spicy. This can be controlled by adjusting the amount of the peppers. I like mine full strength, but for the wife I have to cut the peppers down to 1/8 teaspoon each. This recipe can easily be doubled or quadrupled for large affairs. It goes great with rice, garlic bread, a green salad and a good white wine, such as white Merlot, white Cabernet, Johannisburg Riesling, or Gewurztraminer. Use your favorite firm, white fish fillets in this recipe. Canned diced tomatoes can be used in place of chopping fresh tomatoes.\"",
