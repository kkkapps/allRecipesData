    "des": "\"These lemon marinated, flour/egg coated and deep-fried drumsticks are allowed to 'bloom' in the oil like roses in springtime! These drumsticks look very nice served with this special chile garlic sauce, and they are so tasty!\"",

Refrigerate for another 30 minutes.\nTo Make Sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic until fragrant, then stir in tomato sauce and chile sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, sugar and Worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil. Add water, then stir in cornstarch and cook until thickened. Sprinkle in parsley and remove sauce from heat; set aside.\nHeat 2 quarts oil in a large deep fryer and fry drumsticks one by one; hold drumstick by stick/handle at first and immerse other half in oil to let the chicken 'bloom', then fry the whole thing until cooked through and golden brown. Transfer chicken pieces to paper towelling with a slotted spoon as they are fried, until complete. Finish draining, garnish with parsley sprigs, and serve with reserved sauce.",
