    "des": "\"I always have this in my freezer for when guests pop by. Easy to use in a punch, or just take out what you need by the glass. You can also add vodka, gin or rum; add 1 to 2 cups per bowl of punch and subtract an equal amount of the soda.\"",
    "ins": "Mix rhubarb with water in a large pot and bring to a boil; lower heat to medium-low and simmer until rhubarb becomes mushy, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain juice into a large freezer-proof container. Discard pulp.\nStir sugar, lemon juice, and orange juice concentrate into the rhubarb juice, dissolving sugar, and place in freezer overnight. Stir mixture the next day, then stir every 2 to 3 hours until slushy. If left in freezer unstirred, the punch base will freeze hard; to thaw, microwave, 1 cup at a time, until slushy, 30 seconds to 1 minute.\nMix slushy punch base with lemon-lime soda in a large punch bowl until combined. To serve in individual glasses, mix half punch base with half lemon-lime soda in a large glass.",
