    "des": "\"A never-fail recipe that is a family favorite. Frequent basting during the cooking time is key to a delicious result. We can't help taking several tester bites while waiting for dinner to be ready. Makes great leftovers for sandwiches. A Maritime tradition with home-baked beans and bakery fresh bread. Also fantastic with potato scallop and buttered green beans.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nWhisk beer, brown sugar, and Dijon mustard together in a bowl.\nPlace ham cut side up in a large roasting pan; pour beer mixture over ham.\nBake in the preheated oven until ham begins to brown, about 15 minutes, basting 4 to 5 times.\nReduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cover roasting pan with lid or aluminum foil.\nContinue to bake until ham is heated through, about 90 minutes more, basting frequently.\nRemove lid and bake until ham is well browned, about 15 minutes more. Allow ham to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.",
