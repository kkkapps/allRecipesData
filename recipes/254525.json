    "des": "\"This is a traditional Okinawan dish with Asian bitter melon. I was introduced to it during my time there. I've combined a few different recipes into this one here. You can also add Spam\u00c2\u00ae; it's pretty popular on Okinawa. \n\nPlease note that the bitter melon has a very different taste, but its very good once you get used to it. It's also ridiculously healthy.\"",
    "ins": "Cut tips off melons with a sharp knife; cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out white interior and seeds with a spoon; rinse the melon. Cut into very small pieces. Place in a bowl and generously add kosher salt, mixing until melon is completely covered. Cover and refrigerate until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.\nRinse melon to remove excess salt. Place into a pot filled with water; cover and bring to a boil. Cook until melon has softened slightly, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; drain the melon.\nHeat sesame oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork; season with garlic salt and garlic pepper. Cook and stir until pork is no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Add melon; cook until soft, about 5 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium. Push pork mixture to the edges of the skillet with a spatula. Crack eggs into the center of the skillet; scramble until firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir contents of the skillet together until combined. Season with soy sauce.",
