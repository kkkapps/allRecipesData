    "des": "\"Pork and sauerkraut is the traditional New Year's Day meal here in Pennsylvania Dutch Land. This is my rendition of that holiday meal. \nI usually serve it with mashed potatoes and applesauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nMix sauerkraut, apples, onion, and caraway seeds in a large roasting pan. Stir 1/4 cup apple cider and brown sugar together in a separate bowl; pour over sauerkraut mixture.\nStir Thai seasoning, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a small bowl; rub onto the top and bottom of the roast.\nMake an indentation in the center of the sauerkraut mixture and place the seasoned roast in the indentation. Pour the remaining apple cider around the roast.\nBake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; baste roast with juices. Continue baking roast, basting every 30 minutes, until cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
