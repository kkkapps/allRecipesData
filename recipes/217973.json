    "des": "\"These ice pops are so good!  They're very reminiscent of the strawberry shortcake ice cream bars you can buy with the pink and white cookie bits on the outside.  Feel free to use sugar-free pudding mix.  The number of pops you get will depend on the size of your molds.\"",
    "ins": "Place cookies in blender. Blend on High setting, stopping blender to stir occasionally, until cookies become fine crumbs. Reserve.\nIn clean blender, combine strawberries, sugar, and water. Blend on High setting until smooth.\nCombine pudding mix and milk in a large bowl.  Beat with whisk until thick, about 2 minutes. Stir in cookie crumbs.\nFill ice pop molds 1/3 full of pudding mixture. Layer with strawberry puree to 2/3 full; top evenly with remaining pudding mixture. Place sticks into molds, and freeze overnight. Run molds under hot water if difficult to remove pops.",
