    "des": "\"These little frittatas are so quick and easy, and my husband and kids just gobble them up. Make them in a 24 cup mini-muffin tin. \n\nI first had these at a neighborhood breakfast, and my neighbor added fresh onions and veggies, but this is great for making on nights when there isn't much in the fridge! Honey ham is good in these, as well. They can be served hot or cold and are great as reheated leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Prepare 24-cup mini-muffin pan with cooking spray.\nToss cheese and ham together in a bowl; distribute evenly between the 24 prepared muffin cups.\nBeat eggs, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper together with a whisk in a bowl; pour in equal amounts over ham and cheese in muffin cups.\nBake in preheated oven until tops turn light golden brown, about 12 minutes. Remove frittatas form cups with a spoon.",
