    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion and chicken until the onion is dark brown, and the chicken is golden, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium, and stir in the garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, and clove. Cook and stir until the spices are fragrant and the garlic has softened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garbanzo beans, ketchup, tomato paste, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook 10 minutes. Uncover, and increase heat to medium-high, and allow the sauce to reduce to your desired consistency. Stir in additional water if too thick. Garnish with cilantro to serve.",
