    "des": "\"A true Italian recipe that everyone will enjoy. You can use ready made pizza bread to make this quick...or use your own recipe for a hand tossed pizza, either way, you're sure to enjoy! The escarole does not need to be cooked ahead of time...it cooks right on the pizza. Also, I think with this pizza, the less sauce the better.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLightly brush pizza crust with olive oil. Spread with a thin layer of pizza sauce, and sprinkle with minced garlic. Remove thick stems from escarole, and arrange leaves over pizza. Cover with shredded mozzarella.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.",
