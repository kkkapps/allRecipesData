    "des": "\"Kahlua\u00c2\u00ae, pecan, and chocolate pie; that is the perfect autumn desert. The chocolate chips don't make it too sweet and add just the right texture to a pecan pie. The Kahlua\u00c2\u00ae tastes better if you let the pie sit for a day or two. This is not just your typical pecan pie. You can substitute Kahlua\u00c2\u00ae-flavored coffee syrup for the Kahlua\u00c2\u00ae liqueur, if desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup pecan halves into the bottom of each pie shell.\nWhisk dark corn syrup and eggs together in a bowl. Add sugar, butter, and vanilla extract to corn syrup mixture and whisk until smooth. Stir in coffee-flavored liqueur and chocolate syrup until pie filling is well-mixed. Pour filling into each prepared pie shell, being careful not to disturb the pecans and chocolate chips.\nBake pies in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and filling is puffy set, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.",
