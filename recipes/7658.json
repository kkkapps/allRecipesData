    "des": "\"A puffed fried cake. It can be sprinkled with confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar.\"",
    "ins": "Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.\nIn a large mixing bowl, stir together the eggs and the milk. Add flour mixture to the egg mixture, and beat with a mixer until smooth.  The consistancy should be thin enough to run through a small kitchen funnel.  Test it, and if it is too thick beat in a little more milk; if too thin, beat in a bit more flour.\nIn an eight inch skillet, heat the oil to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).\nPut your finger over the bottom opening of the funnel, and fill the funnel with a generous 1/2 cup of the batter.  Hold the funnel close to the surface of the oil, and release the batter into the oil while making a circular  motion.  Fry until golden brown.  Use tongs and wide spatula to turn the cake over carefully.  Fry the second side one minute.  Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with sifted confectioners' sugar.",
