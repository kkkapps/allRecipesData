    "des": "\"This is my great-grandmother's recipe, great right out of the pot or as leftovers. Each serving is half a pepper plus some of the additional meatballs. Really good served over additional cooked rice.\"",
    "ins": "Mix ground beef, egg, rice, bread crumbs, and onion powder together in a large bowl.\nPack the ground beef mixture into the green bell peppers, eliminating all air pockets. Form the remaining beef mixture into large balls.\nCombine water, tomato sauce, tomato paste, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder in a Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Carefully lower peppers and meatballs into the sauce with a slotted spoon. Bring back to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until beef is cooked through and rice is tender, about 1 hour.\nMix sour cream and flour together in a small bowl. Slowly stir in some of the sauce. Pour into the Dutch oven and mix well. Simmer until flavors combine, 3 to 4 minutes more.",
