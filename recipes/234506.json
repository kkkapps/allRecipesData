    "des": "\"Pork chops with beef broth, onions, and sour cream served with white rice. I tend to make 1 1/2 cups dry rice with 3 cups water in a rice cooker while the pork chops are simmering. Beef broth is good in this, but if you have any leftover French onion soup, try that instead.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops in hot skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side; add onions.\nStir broth, Cajun seasoning, mustard, paprika, and savory together in a bowl; pour over the pork chops and onions.\nPlace a cover on the skillet, bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the pork is slightly pink in the center, 30 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Stir sour cream into the liquid in the pan; continue cooking until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.",
