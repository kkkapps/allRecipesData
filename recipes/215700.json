    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nMix together the honey, lime juice, spiced rum, orange zest, orange juice, ginger, cilantro, salt, black pepper, and cornstarch in a large bowl until the glaze is smooth and the cornstarch is thoroughly blended with the rest of the ingredients. Pour half the glaze into a smaller bowl for basting. Rinse and pat the shrimp dry, and gently stir into the large bowl to thoroughly coat the shrimp with the glaze.\nRemove from the glaze, and discard the used glaze. Thread 5 shrimp onto each skewer, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper.\nGrill the shrimp until bright pink and opaque and the glaze has cooked onto the shrimp, about 4 minutes per side. Baste with additional unused glaze before turning the shrimp over.",
