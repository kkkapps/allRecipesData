Pour soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and water over all. Then distribute the onion and garlic amongst the chops and veggies; top by sprinkling bread crumbs and dry seasonings of your choice over all.\nClose foil around all and seal tightly. Place foil pouch in a 9x13 inch baking dish lines with another sheet of aluminum foil, in case of spilling. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. The pouch provides 'self-basting', so you need only remove from the oven and serve!",
