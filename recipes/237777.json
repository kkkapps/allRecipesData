    "des": "\"Yet another great variation on the ever-popular tailgating and sports-bar snack and very simple and easy to make. I have tried this with several brands of lemon pepper seasonings and found I actually liked the cheapest one the most. It was a tad twangier than the others and was more suited to my liking. I found it at my local food store in the seasoning section. I also tend to lean towards a lemon pepper seasoning that includes a white pepper and less black.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhisk butter and lemon pepper seasoning together in a large bowl.\nPlace onions in the preheated oil and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard onions.\nWorking in batches, cook wings in oil until crispy on the outside and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove wings to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\nToss wings with lemon pepper mixture until completely coated. Return to paper towel-lined plate to drain excess liquid.",
