    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir taco seasoning mix into the beef; transfer to a large bowl, reserving drippings in the skillet.\nCook and stir sweet onion and green onion in the hot drippings until tender, 5 to 7 minutes; add to seasoned ground beef along with cream cheese and salsa. Stir the mixture until the cream cheese melts completely.\nArrange tortillas onto a flat work surface. Spoon even amounts of the beef mixture in a line down the center of each tortilla. Top beef with even portions of the pepperjack cheese. Roll tortillas around the filling and arrange into a baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce evenly over the tortillas; top with olives and remaining cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until cheese melts completely, about 20 minutes.",
