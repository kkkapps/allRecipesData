(It's not as low-cal as hers.)  It's also easy to adjust to your family's fruit preferences. Be sure to drain the fruit very well so the salad is not too soupy.\"",
    "ins": "In a large non-metallic serving bowl, stir together the crushed pineapple, sugar, and ricotta cheese until well blended. Stir in the fruit cocktail, pineapple tidbits, strawberries, apples and nectarines. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. The longer you refrigerate before serving, the better it will taste.",
