    "ins": "Sift flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl.\nBeat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat eggs, one at a time, into butter mixture until completely incorporated. Beat vanilla extract in with the last egg. Mix flour mixture into egg mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips, mixing dough just enough to evenly combine. Wrap dough in plastic and chill overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRoll cookie dough out on a lightly floured surface and cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Arrange cookies about 1 1/2 inch apart on baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
