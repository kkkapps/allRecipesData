    "ins": "Melt 3/4 cup chocolate chips gently in the microwave or over a pot of simmering water (bain marie). Set aside to cool.\nSift flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl, and stir together.\nBeat the butter and sugar together until thick and creamy. Beat in eggs one by one. Add cooled melted chocolate and vanilla extract. Continue beating until ingredients are well mixed.\nFold dry ingredients and 2 1/4 cups chocolate chips into the mix and stir until combined.\nScoop cookie with a 1 tablespoon scoop (if the mix is soft you can pop it in the fridge to stiffen up and this will make it easier to scoop).\nBake at 350 degrees F for 8 to 9 minutes. Take care not to overbake as these cookies should be almost brownie-like.\nOnce baked, pop a marshmallow on top and put it back in the oven on broil for 1-2 minutes for a lovely toasted effect.",
