    "des": "\"A moist, delicious Greek treat. You can alter the sugar depending on your sweet tooth. When adding the milk to the semolina don't get to close, the steam may burn you. Oh, and the smell is awful but the result is delicious. Sprinkle with cinnamon and decorate with walnuts or slivered almonds.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine water, milk, sugar and cinnamon. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. Remove cinnamon stick.\nIn another saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Allow it to bubble, but not to brown. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the semolina, a little at a time, until mixture is thick and smooth. Allow it to brown slightly, then stir in the milk mixture, a little at a time. Continue to stir until mixture has progressed from creamy to thick.\nPlace halva in a gelatin mold or glass dish. Serve warm or cold.",
