    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate or 2-quart casserole dish.\nHeat broth in the microwave or on stovetop until hot, but not boiling. Pour broth over matzo pieces in a large bowl; let soak until matzo absorbs broth, about 15 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Cook and stir onion, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in the hot oil until browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until wilted and browned, 6 to 8 minutes.\nStir mushroom mixture and parsley into matzo mixture. Beat eggs with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl until blended; stir into matzo mixture and pour into prepared pie plate.\nBake in the preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.",
