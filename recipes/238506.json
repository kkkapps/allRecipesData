    "des": "\"I was in Santa Monica a few years ago, where I ordered a chicken Parmesan that featured a garlic, rosemary, and Marsala-spiked sauce. I loved the subtle sweetness the wine added to the tomato. For whatever reason, I thought of those flavors while brainstorming a quick skirt steak marinade, and this is what happened. Skirt steak is always great on the grill and doesn't need much help, but I love how this came out.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk Marsala wine, ketchup, garlic, kosher salt, rosemary, and black pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add skirt steak and turn to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove steak from marinade, shake off excess, and discard marinade.\nCook steak on the preheated grill until meat shines, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer meat to a plate and let rest at least 5 minutes before slicing against the grain.",
