    "des": "\"Yes, it is gloriously Southern -- as I am, and a family favorite! It's made with dark corn syrup, peanut butter and whole peanuts and looks like pumpkin pie, but don't be fooled!   This pie is simple and delicious for those who like peanut butter.  It is a great recipe to serve guests as it is an unexpected taste treat! Serve with whipped topping or ice cream if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, combine  sugar, salt, corn syrup, peanut butter and eggs with electric mixer. Stir in peanuts by hand. Pour filling into pie crust.\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. (Center of filling may be slightly soft but will become firm as pie cools.)",
