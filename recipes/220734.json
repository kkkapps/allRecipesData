    "des": "\"These burgers are so easy to make and so good! The sour cream and salsa dip is the perfect addition to these. Serve patties warm with sour cream and salsa dip in a pita with fresh greens, or however you desire. The burgers themselves are vegan, just exclude the sour cream dip. Enjoy!\"",
