    "des": "\"Marinated flank steak cooked on the BBQ. The most tender and flavorful steak! You may want to add a pinch of salt if you are using light soy sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the flank steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove flank steak from the marinade; shake to remove excess moisture. Discard remaining marinade.\nCook steak on the grill until beginning to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Slice against the grain of the meat to serve.",
