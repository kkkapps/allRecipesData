    "des": "\"This is my go-to unexpected side for Thanksgiving and other pot-lucks. Aside from being gorgeous, it holds up well when made ahead, tastes great at room temp, and appeals to lots of eaters because it's vegan, paleo, gluten-free, and low-carb friendly. The only thing that takes time is deconstructing the Brussels sprouts. The salad keeps in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\"",
    "ins": "Cut cores out of Brussels sprouts using a paring knife. Peel layers apart to separate individual leaves; place leaves in a large bowl.\nWhisk maple syrup, olive oil, Dijon mustard, and apple cider vinegar together in a small bowl. Drizzle over Brussels sprout leaves; add cranberries and toss to coat. Add almonds and toss again before serving.",
