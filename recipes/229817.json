    "des": "\"Beautiful fall colors and amazing flavors make this a favorite at any holiday gathering. Stir in milk and sour cream for a creamier texture if desired. The beets should not mash all the way. It should be orange-ish with streaks and dots of red from the beets. The name alone will convince your picky eaters to try this, and the taste will make them want more!\"",
