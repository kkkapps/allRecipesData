    "ins": "In a large bowl, layer the tomatoes, bell peppers and onion, seasoning each layer with salt as you go. Keep making layers until you run out of vegetables. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours.\nPour the vegetables into a colander and rinse off the salt under running water. Put them into a pot with a lid, and stir in the vinegar, brown sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, white sugar, whole cloves, and corn syrup. Bring to a boil, and then simmer over medium heat, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. The tomatoes will start to turn pale.\nWhen the vegetables are very soft, press them through a sieve, being sure to find all of the cloves and remove them. Cool the sauce and store in the refrigerator.",
