    "ins": "Stir together the lime juice, chili oil, and sea salt in a mixing bowl until the salt dissolves. Cut the shrimp through the back vein nearly through to the other side, leaving the two sides attached.  Toss the shrimp in the marinade, cover, and refrigerate 4 hours. Soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes.\nMake the raspberry dipping sauce by bringing the raspberry vinegar, sugar, and raspberries to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until the raspberries have lost their form and turned into a sauce. Scrape the raspberry mixture into a fine mesh strainer, and allow any excess liquid to drip away. Discard the liquid, and place the pulp into a small bowl. Stir in the minced jalapeno peppers to complete the dipping sauce.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nRemove the shrimp from the marinade, and thread one onto each soaked skewer. Wiggle the skewer through the shrimp so that the tails are pointing upwards. These should look like lollipops. Place the skewers onto a broiler pan.\nCook in the preheated oven until the shrimp start to look pink and a little toasty, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Serve with the raspberry dipping sauce.",
