    "des": "\"A not-too-sweet Christmas cookie that goes great with cup of hot coffee or a glass of cold milk. One of Santa's favorites! These are great to make at the beginning of December and then simply bake in the oven when something sweet is quickly needed at the last minute during the holidays. Dough can be kept in refrigerator for a couple of weeks before baking.\"",
    "ins": "Beat brown sugar, butter, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended, then beat in the vanilla extract with the last egg.\nMix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Fold pecans and candied cherries into dough. Shape dough into 1 1/2-inch rolls on a piece of waxed paper. Seal waxed paper on the ends with tape; refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSlice cookies to about 1/4-inch thickness and arrange on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.",
