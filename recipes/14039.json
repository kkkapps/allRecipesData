Press dough onto the bottom and side of the pie plate to fill in any gaps.\nIn a medium bowl stir together the soup mix, half and half cream and eggs. Stir the cheese and  cooked vegetables into the egg mixture until blended. Pour into the prepared crust. Fold the points of dough that are hanging over the edge back in over the filling.\nBake the quiche for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.",
