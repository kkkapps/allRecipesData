    "ins": "Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with aluminum foil.\nMelt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until smooth, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).  Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Using a spatula, quickly spread the melted chocolate evenly in the prepared pan until the bottom of the pan is covered. Sprinkle the crushed candy evenly over the chocolate, and pat lightly with a clean spatula to help the candy settle into the chocolate.\nMelt the red confectioner's coating, if using, in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until smooth, 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Spoon the melted coating into a resealable plastic bag; snip off a very small corner of the bag, and use to drizzle coating over the bark.\nPlace the pan in the refrigerator or freezer until hardened, about 30 minutes. Remove from pan; peel off foil.  Break into small pieces to serve.",
