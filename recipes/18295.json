    "des": "\"Bursting with juicy beef and tender rice: the best stuffed peppers around. The addition of sour cream is part of the pleasure.\"",
    "ins": "Cut the tops off the peppers and remove seeds and stems. Set aside.\nPlace rice in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then drain water. In a large bowl, mix together rice, ground beef, egg, onion, salt, and pepper.\nStuff each pepper with an equal amount of beef mixture, then place peppers in a pot large enough to hold them in a single layer. Pour tomato juice into pot. Cover pot and simmer over low heat for 90 minutes, until ground beef is fully cooked and rice is tender.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together sour cream and flour. Whisk in 1 cup of tomato juice from pot, then pour mixture back into pot. Allow to simmer an additional 5 minutes, then serve peppers with juice spooned over top.",
