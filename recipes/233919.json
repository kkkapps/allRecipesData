Stir potatoes into sausage mixture and pour in enough water to cover mixture; add bay leaves.\nSimmer sausage-potato mixture over low heat until potatoes are tender and flavors of soup have blended, 1 to 2 hours.\nCombine flour and butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until mixture is smooth and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Whisk milk into flour-butter mixture until thickened; season with salt. Stir flour-butter mixture into soup until well combined. Remove and discard bay leaves before serving.",
