    "des": "\"This is good on a cold winter night or when you have a cold.  In order to make this just right you need to make the noodles ahead of time so that they can dry before putting them in the soup.  You can make them the night before and store in an air tight container and place in the freezer.\"",
    "ins": "Mix eggs and milk together until well beaten and then add salt and flour.  Dough should be stiff.  On a floured surface roll dough out really thin, 1/8 of an inch.  Let dry 30 minutes and then cut into thin slices.  Place on wax paper and let air dry.\nIn a large stock pot add chicken broth, celery, onion, baby carrots, and garlic.  Fill stock pot, 2 inches from the top with water.  Simmer until vegetables are tender, about 2 hours.\nAdd chicken and corn.  Season with salt, pepper, seasoning salt and chicken bouillon granules.  Simmer for 30 minutes, checking to see if water level has decreased.  Add water if needed.\nBring to a boil, add noodles, stirring often.  Noodles should be done in 20 minutes.  Serve hot.",
