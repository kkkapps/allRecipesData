    "des": "\"Comforting tapioca pudding is usually infused with vanilla. I had some rose water on hand and thought I'd try it instead. The result was too delicious to keep to myself! I use goat's milk since I'm allergic to cow's milk, but feel free to use 2% cow's milk if you prefer it.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan, stir together the sugar, tapioca, goat's milk, and egg. Set aside for 5 minutes for the tapioca to soak.\nPlace the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.\nRemove from heat and stir in the rose water.\nLadle the pudding into 4 small individual dessert dishes. Cover each dish with a piece of plastic wrap, pushing the wrap down onto the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Let the puddings cool slightly on the countertop, about 5 minutes.\nChill in refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.",
