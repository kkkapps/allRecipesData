    "des": "\"My children love spice cookies at any time. I think most children love them.  I am enclosing a recipe that moms and dads can have their children help with during the baking at Christmas.  Every child keeps their special memories of every day with the family and I sure remember mine from when I was a little girl.\"",
    "ins": "Beat the sugar, molasses, butter or margarine, and oil together. Add 2 cups of the flour and the baking soda, cloves, ginger, and cinnamon. Mix in the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough is stiff. Flatten into disks and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nOn a lightly floured surface roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thick and use cookie cutters to cut into desired shapes. Place cookies on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes.",
