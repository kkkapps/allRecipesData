    "des": "\"For a gourmet meal this is very easy to prepare.  Leftovers reheat well the next day too!  Instead of using fresh shrimp like the recipe originally called (took too long the first time I did it) we now use frozen, raw, peeled and it tastes the exact same, but with 1/4 of the time! This is great over rice and served with French bread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly saute shrimp until they turn pink, but are not cooked through; remove from skillet and set aside.  Add the bell peppers, onion, garlic, fennel seeds, and thyme; cook until the onion softens, about 8 minutes.\nStir in white wine, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the flavors blend, about 10 minutes.  Add the shrimp, and simmer until they are cooked and turn opaque, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the basil, and season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.",
