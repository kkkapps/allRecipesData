Line a baking pan with aluminum foil; coat with cooking spray.\nCombine mayonnaise and paprika in a bowl; mix well.\nMix panko and garlic powder together in another bowl.\nSpread mayonnaise-paprika mixture on each chicken thigh; press into panko mixture to coat. Place in the prepared baking pan; spritz thighs with cooking spray.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
