    "des": "\"Yummy burgers that are very simple and quick to prepare and can be topped with just about any kind of cheese. Works very will with a Foreman\u00c2\u00ae grill. Also works well if you want to make the patties and refrigerate them for a few hours before cooking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nMix egg, garlic, salt, and mushrooms in a bowl. Add ground beef and mix until combined; divide into three patties.\nCook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 5 to 7 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
