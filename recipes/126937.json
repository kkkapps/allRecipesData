    "des": "\"A popular Jamaican appetizer. Just stamp them out in the kitchen, take some for the road and go! Saltcod can be prepared the day before for a quicker cook time. These are also good served with a spicy dipping sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Soak the cod in cold water overnight to rehydrate it and remove excess salt (or see Cook's Note).\nRemove any bones and skin. Flake and shred the fish into small pieces and set aside.\nSift flour, baking powder, and pepper into a large bowl. Add the diced tomatoes, green onions, and flaked cod. Pour in 1/2 cup water and stir until everything is blended.\nHeat 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, drop rounded spoonfuls of batter into the skillet. Fry on each side until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.",
