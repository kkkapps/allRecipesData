    "des": "\"Super quick prep and your family will love it! My children are dairy-intolerant; I have found that coconut milk is an excellent substitute for milk and cream and gives any dish a wonderful flavor. This recipe is gluten-free and dairy-free. It is also wonderful served over rice.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCombine coconut milk, beef broth, portobello mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and sea salt in a 9x13-inch casserole dish; mix well. Add beef tips; stir until well-coated.\nBake in the preheated oven until beef is tender and sauce has thickened, about 1 hour.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Serve beef tips and sauce over pasta.",
