(You'll have a generous 1/3 cup.) Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.\nTransfer rum and ginger mixture to a blender with pineapple and coconut milk and blend until smooth. Pour into 12 (3-ounce) ice pop molds, dividing evenly. Cover molds, insert sticks, and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours and up to 2 weeks.",
