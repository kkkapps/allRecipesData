    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the flour and cream just until blended. You should have a sticky dough. Use a large spoon to scrape the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough once or twice, then pat or roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into circles using a biscuit cutter. Place on a baking sheet, spacing 1/2 inch apart. If you like drop biscuits, you can skip the this part and just drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until the bottoms and tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
