Adding your own personalized message allows you to create great favors for any occasion! Alternatively, I have rolled these into tube-like cigar shapes and filled them with icing for other occasions which have been a crowd pleaser!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets, or line with parchment paper. Have fortunes ready to go on small strips of paper.\nIn a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites and sugar on high speed of an electric mixer until frothy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low, and stir in melted butter, vanilla, almond extract, water and flour one at a time, mixing well after each. Consistency should resemble pancake batter.  Spoon the batter into 3 inch circles on the prepared baking sheets. Leave room between for spreading.\nBake for 5 to 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges begin to brown slightly. Quickly remove one at a time, place a message in the center, and fold in half. Fold the ends of the half together into a horse shoe shape. If they spring open, place them in a muffin tin to cool until set.",
