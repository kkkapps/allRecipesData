Repeat sifting process 2 more times.\nBeat sugar and shortening together until smooth and creamy. Add flour mixture, buttermilk, eggs, lemon extract, vanilla extract, and butter extract; beat until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared tube pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 75 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
