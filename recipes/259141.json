    "des": "\"I love shrimp toast from the Chinese restaurants. Some restaurants make them really well and some do not. I love to cook and wanted to give it a try. I set out my search for a good tasting recipe. After trying several, I came up with my own! My recipe will knock your socks off! I have to stop myself from eating them before I finish my batch.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay bread slices on a tray.\nCombine egg, celery, parsley, soy sauce, rice vinegar, cornstarch, salt, sesame oil, garlic powder, baking powder, black pepper, five-spice powder, and red pepper flakes in a bowl. Mix well.\nPlace shrimp, water chestnuts, green onions, garlic, and ginger in a food processor. Pulse into a chunky paste. Stir into the egg mixture until combined.\nPlace a generous dollop of the shrimp paste on each piece of bread; spread evenly towards the crusts using the back of a spoon. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top, pressing them into the paste. Cut each bread slice into 2 to 4 triangles.\nFry bread slices, paste side-down, in the preheated oil, until edges are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn bread over and fry until other side is crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel-lined tray to drain. Serve with sweet chili sauce.",
