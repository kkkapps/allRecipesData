    "ins": "Mix graham crackers, 1/3 cup sugar, and butter in a bowl; press half the graham cracker mixture into the bottom of 9x13-inch baking dish.\nCombine boiling water and lemon gelatin in another bowl. Mix lemon juice and lemon zest in a measuring cup and add enough water to make 1 cup; stir lemon juice mixture and 1 cup sugar into gelatin mixture until sugar is dissolved. Refrigerate and allow mixture to partially set, about 30 minutes.\nBeat evaporated milk in a cold glass or metal bowl until medium peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the milk should curl over slightly. Fold gelatin mixture into whipped milk until evenly mixed.\nPour gelatin mixture into prepared crust and sprinkle remaining graham cracker mixture on top. Chill at least 3 hours before serving.",
