    "des": "\"Pao de Queijo is a traditional peasants' bread from Minas-Gerais state in Brazil, but is now a delight countrywide. Last time I visited Brazil I was surprised to find cheese bread at the airport, offered along with American-brand pizza, though with a Brazilian brand that reminds us of this old Mineira tradition. (Minas-Gerais means the general mines, as this part of Brazil was the first where rich mines of gold, diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones were found. It is also where one of the world's richest iron ore deposits are located.)\"",
