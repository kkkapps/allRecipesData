    "des": "\"If you like the taste of Japanese dishes, you will love it. Very crispy, and my friends like it too. You can buy joshinko (rice flour), katakuriko (potato starch), and sesame oil at asian market. If you live in large city, you may find them at American grocery store. Joshinko and katakuriko taste nothing different from regular flour, but they really help to make crispy fried chicken. Do not use sweet soy sauce or too salty soy sauce.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together eggs, salt, pepper, sugar, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, and bouillon. Add chicken pieces, and stir to coat.  Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nRemove bowl from refrigerator, add potato starch and rice flour to meat, and mix well.\nIn a large skillet or deep fryer, heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Place chicken in hot oil, and fry until golden brown. Cook meat in batches to maintain oil temperature. Drain briefly on paper towels. Serve hot.",
