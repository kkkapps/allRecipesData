    "des": "\"This is an easy and sumptuous recipe of eggplant layered with tomatoes and onions, then smothered with sour cream. It bakes up to yield a delicious sauce.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine the lemon juice and water. Place the eggplant slices into the lemon water to soak while you bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Drain and rinse the eggplant slices, then place them into the boiling water. Cook for 8 minutes, or until barely tender. Drain.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Layer the eggplant slices, tomatoes and onion in the dish, sprinkling each layer with a little flour as you go. In a medium bowl, stir together the sour cream, garlic, salt and pepper. Spread this over the top of the casserole. Sprinkle generously with paprika.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is nicely browned and there is a bubbly sauce.",
