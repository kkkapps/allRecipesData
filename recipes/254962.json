    "des": "\"Jamaican goat curry that will have you coming back for more. The meat is so tender it melts in your mouth. You can adjust the heat by using more or less of the Scotch bonnet pepper. You never knew how good goat could be! Serve with white rice or rice with peas.\"",
    "ins": "Combine goat meat and vinegar in a large bowl; cover with water. Let stand, about 5 minutes. Drain, massaging the meat.\nMix onion, 6 tablespoons curry powder, Scotch bonnet peppers, garlic, allspice berries, salt, pepper, and thyme together in a bowl to make a spice rub. Rub into goat meat until coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nScrape spice rub off the goat meat, reserving it in a bowl.\nHeat oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add remaining 2 tablespoons curry powder; stir until dark and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add goat meat; cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.\nStir reserved spice rub, potatoes, and carrots into the saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, adding more water as needed, until goat meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Discard allspice berries. Season with salt and pepper.",
