    "ins": "Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.\nPreheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees Celsius).\nArrange almonds on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, watching carefully and stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool.\nIn a bowl, mix together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, green onions, crumbled bacon, dill weed, and black pepper until well blended. Form mixture into a pinecone shape, and carefully place on a serving dish.\nBeginning at the top of the \"pinecone\" with the points facing upward, press cooled almonds gently into cheese, each point slightly overlapping the bottom of the almond above. If desired, press a few pine nuts randomly between some of the almonds. Serve with crackers for spreading.",
