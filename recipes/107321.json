Made using bread and your choice of filling, hobo pies are quick, cheap, easy, fun, and very adaptable to everyone's needs!  Hobo Pie irons are available at camping or outdoors stores.\"",
    "ins": "Spray a hobo pie toaster with nonstick cooking spray.  Evenly spread one side of each slice of bread with softened butter.  Lay a slice of bread, butter side down, into the toaster.  Spoon on pie filling, and top with second slice of bread, butter side up.\nClose up toaster, and cook over a hot campfire, turning occasionally, until the pie is hot and golden brown, about 4 minutes.",
