    "des": "\"They say smell is the sense most closely linked to memory recall, and that was certainly the case while making these garlicky, buttery bay scallops on toast. As waves of the wonderful aromas wafted up from the pan, they brought back a flood of vivid memories of my first kitchen job.\"",

Cook for 30 seconds without stirring.\nToss scallops in pan and stir in garlic. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nStir wine and lemon juice into scallops, bring to a boil, and cook for about 30 seconds.\nStir parsley and cold butter into scallops and remove from heat. When butter melts, stir in salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.\nSpoon scallops over buttered toast and serve immediately.",
