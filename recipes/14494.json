    "des": "\"In addition to his duties as Associate Artistic Director for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Tim is head chef for staff BBQ's. The secret to his magic is a sweet teriyaki that is a wonderful marinade and basting sauce. Use for everything from salmon to chicken to eggplant. It even works for tofu. This recipe makes enough for a whole salmon.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan, combine ginger, garlic, and 1 cup vermouth. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook until ginger and garlic are tender.\nStir in remaining vermouth, soy sauce, honey, and oyster sauce. Bring to a low boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes to 1 hour; longer is better, but 15 minutes will do in a pinch. Watch carefully to be sure that the mixture does not foam and boil over.\nRemove marinade from heat, and taste. The sauce should be sweet, not salty. If necessary, add up to 1 more cup of honey. Cool to room temperature. Marinade can be refrigerated for 4 to 5 days.",
