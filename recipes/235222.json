    "des": "\"This is one of my family's favorite sweets, passed down from Aunt Sheryl. They're like a hello dolly or magic bar rolled up into a ball! My kids help me make them, especially if I let them eat a couple while they're still warm! We make them several times during the holidays and throughout the year, and they usually bring in quite a bit of money in our student ministry's dessert auction at church!\"",
