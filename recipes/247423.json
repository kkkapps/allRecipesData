    "des": "\"If you are like me, lactose intolerant, finding a recipe for ice cream can be difficult. This is one I make often, using matcha green tea for flavoring, but you should feel free to do your own thing. For the sake of this recipe, however, I'll be using the green tea as the flavoring.\"",
    "ins": "Combine silken tofu, sugar, and salt in a blender; blend until tofu is the consistency of thick cream. Add almond milk and matcha powder; stir with a spoon until well-blended.\nPour mixture into your ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's instructions, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a lidded container.\nFreeze at least 30 minutes before serving.",
