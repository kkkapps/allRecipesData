    "des": "\"Using a variation of the Yummy Cheese Ball recipe found on this site by TABKAT, this ghoulishly good cheese ball has become a part of our family's Halloween tradition! It's as much fun to make as it is to eat! This recipe is even better if allowed to stay refrigerated for a day or two before decorating and serving. Serve with buttery crackers or fresh veggies.\"",
    "ins": "Cook and turn bacon in batches in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, cool, and chop bacon into small pieces.\nStir cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, diced green onion, and bacon pieces together in a bowl until well combined. Form cheese mixture into two balls, wrap each with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up to 3 days.\nRemove cheese balls from refrigerator 1 hour prior to decorating. Decorate cheese balls using red cabbage for hair, green olives for eyes, pepperoncini for nose, red pepper for mouth, black olives for toes, red pepper for toe nails, and reserved green onion tops for ears.",
