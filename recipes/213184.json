    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet. Combine tomatoes, feta, arugula, and garlic in a small bowl.\nArrange mushroom caps, stem side up, on the prepared baking sheet.  Drizzle each with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast in preheated oven until mushrooms begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven.\nSprinkle caps with Parmesan cheese; divide tomato mixture evenly between each mushroom cap. Season with salt and pepper; drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Top each mushroom with 2 slices of fontina cheese.\nReturn to oven until cheese is melted, but tomato mixture is still cool in the center, about 3 minutes.",
