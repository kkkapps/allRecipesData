    "des": "\"This is a great quiche recipe - high in protein, which we need every day, especially as vegetarians. It is quick and relatively easy to make. All good cooks can adapt this recipe to their own requirements and availability of certain ingredients - but it tastes the best using the ones I have suggested here. If the ingredients are organic, they will be that much better.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower; cover and steam until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool to room temperature.\nBlend cauliflower, mushrooms, and green onions in a blender under chopped, yet still chunky.\nSeparate egg yolks and egg whites into 2 separate bowls. Beat egg whites in a bowl using an electric mixer until medium peaks form.\nCombine half-and-half, butter, and flour together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until white sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly.\nStir white sauce, Parmesan cheese, cauliflower mixture, egg yolks, turmeric, salt, pepper, and curry powder together in a bowl; gently fold in egg whites using a spatula or wide knife. Pour egg mixture into a glass baking dish. Sprinkle paprika over egg mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes.",
