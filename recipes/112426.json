Cook and stir until the mixture forms a thick sauce, about 10 minutes.\nCombine the sauce, the mashed parsnips, and the bread crumbs. Season the mixture to taste with salt and pepper; form mixture into patties.\nHeat oil in a large, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry patties, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; serve hot.",
