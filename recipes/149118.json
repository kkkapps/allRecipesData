    "des": "\"I love mushroom barley soup and I was originally making one that took about 3 hours to cook.  This one is so simple and easy and takes a third of the time.  If you like mushroom barley soup, you will really like this.  It's perfect for a cold winter night.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic; cook and stir until onions are tender and transparent. Stir in mushrooms and continue to cook for a few minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and add barley. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until barley is tender, about 50 minutes. Season with salt and pepper before serving.",
