Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nProcess 2 cups flour, butter, and 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar in a food processor until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; press into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges of the crust are golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. Cool crust to room temperature.\nBeat white sugar, eggs, 1/4 cup flour, lemon juice, baking powder, and lemon zest together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy; pour onto the cooled crust.\nBake in the oven until custard is set, 25 to 28 minutes.
