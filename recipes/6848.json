    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 9x5 inch loaf pans.\nSift together the flour, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon and sugar in a large mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center.  Beat together the eggs and oil and pour them into the well. Stir just enough to moisten the ingredients. Fold in the strawberries and nuts. Pour mixture into prepared pans; fill containers no more than half full.\nBake in a preheated oven about 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool 20 to 30 minutes before removing from pans. Move to a rack to cool completely before slicing.",
