Along with the chocolate come the simple additions of milk and seltzer water. The magic of this drink is how it produces such a rich, yet refreshing chocolate beverage.\"",
    "ins": "Pour chocolate syrup into a large glass. Pour milk on top of chocolate syrup; stir until completely incorporated and smooth, about 30 seconds.\nSlowly pour seltzer water into chocolate mixture, stirring constantly. Mixture will foam and bubble. Serve immediately.",
