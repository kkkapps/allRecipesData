    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDissolve bouillon in 1 tablespoon water. In a medium bowl combine the rice, butter/margarine, onion and 2 cups water. Mix well and pour mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nPlace thighs on top of rice mixture and season to taste. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes (depends on the size of the thighs).",
