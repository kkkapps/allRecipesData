    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nHeat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook beef in Dutch oven until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.\nMix brown sugar, salt, mustard, and black pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the roast. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and onion in the Dutch oven around the roast. Pour vinegar and water over the vegetables.\nPlace a cover on the Dutch oven and put in preheated oven. Cook until the roast is hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).",
