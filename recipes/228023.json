    "des": "\"I searched everywhere for a hearty breakfast muffin and had to invent my own in order to make it tasty and whole-wheat without loads of sugar or exotic ingredients. 100% whole-wheat. Almost no fat and very little sugar. But chocolatey and delicious. This is a very dense muffin that literally could replace a meal (if nuts are added).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.\nMix mashed bananas and brown sugar together in a large bowl. Add eggs, olive oil, and vanilla extract; mix well.\nMix flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture. Fold chocolate chips and walnuts into batter. Distribute batter into the muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.",
