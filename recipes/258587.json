    "des": "\"Mofongo is a fried plantain-based dish from Puerto Rico. It is typically made with fried green plantains mashed together in a pilon (which consists of a wooden mortar and pestle), with broth, garlic, olive oil, and pork cracklings or bits of bacon. \nThis version is completely vegan. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it!\"",
    "ins": "Fill a 1-quart pot with water; boil plantains with a pinch of salt until easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.\nMash plantains with tomato sauce, cilantro, sofrito, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, and sazon in a mortar or glass bowl. Incorporate the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and enough vegetable broth to ensure that mofongo sticks together but is dry enough to easily slip out of a container. Season with salt and pepper.\nServe mofongo on top of the remaining 5 tablespoons vegetable broth in a bowl.",
