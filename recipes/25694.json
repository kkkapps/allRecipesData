    "des": "\"I make lots of cream soups and this is a good 'basic' recipe. I originally made this in 1990 and always make some modifications - we like lots of garlic as reflected in this recipe!! I also add or substitute other vegetables, i.e., broccoli and spinach. I also use potatoes for thickening rather than cream to keep the fat down.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over medium heat, melt butter.  Stir in onion and garlic and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in potatoes and carrots and cook 5 minutes more.  Pour in chicken broth and bring to a boil.  Stir in cauliflower, cover, reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, 10 to 20 minutes.  Remove from heat.\nPuree in batches in a blender or food processor, or in the pot using an immersion blender.  Return to low heat and stir in milk, salt, pepper, nutmeg and sherry.  Heat through.  Serve garnished with parsley.",
