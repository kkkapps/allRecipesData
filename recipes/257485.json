    "des": "\"This mochiko chicken is my daughter's favorite thing in the whole wide world. If you have never eaten mochiko chicken then you don't know what you been missing. This is a staple in many potlucks, tailgating and family gatherings. Mochiko is a Japanese sweet flour that makes a light batter. I make this for my family of 8 once a month. I have to triple the recipe and there is never leftovers.\"",

Whisk into the flour mixture to form a smooth batter.\nStir chicken strips gently into the batter. Marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.\nFill a deep saucepan with 1 1/2 inch oil; heat over medium heat. Fry chicken strips in batches in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes.",
