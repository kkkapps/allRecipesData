    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Move oven rack to position slightly above middle of oven. Generously grease a 13x9-inch baking dish.\nMix cornmeal, bread crumbs, salt, paprika, dill, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Pour milk into a separate bowl.\nDip orange roughy pieces into milk and then press into bread crumbs to coat on all sides. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place breaded orange roughy into prepared baking dish in a single layer while breading the rest. Drizzle butter over the breaded fish pieces.\nBake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with fork, about 10 minutes.",
