    "ins": "Mix brown and white sugar with the milk in large pot; bring mixture to a boil. Stir in peanut butter, reduce heat to medium, and bring the mixture back to boil (stirring constantly). Remove the pot from heat when a drop of the mixture forms a ball in a glass of cold water.\nStir margarine and vanilla into the mixture; stir vigorously until the fudge hardens. (Always stir in same direction.) Pour fudge onto buttered plates or waxed paper.  Let cool and cut into 1-inch pieces.",
