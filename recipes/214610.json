    "des": "\"I'm not a fan of ground beef, but I like the flavor of sloppy joes. This recipe incorporates the flavor of the classic sandwich with the lean cut of flank steak and the ease of a slow cooker.\"",
    "ins": "Sprinkle the beef flank steak with steak seasoning on both sides. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until the oil shimmers, and place the flank steak into the hot oil. Quickly brown the steak on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Set the beef aside.\nStir brown sugar, onion, red bell pepper, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce, and tomato paste together in a slow cooker until the brown sugar dissolves. Place the flank steak into the slow cooker, immersing it in the sauce. Set the cooker on on High and cook 4 hours, or set on Low and cook 8 hours.\nTo serve, shred the meat with 2 forks, or remove the meat, chop, and return to the sauce. Toast buns, and serve the sloppied steak on the toasted buns.",
