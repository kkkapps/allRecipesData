    "des": "\"This cake is more of a confection than a cake. It makes a beautiful, festive presentation. This recipe came to our family from a dear lady, Mrs. Barrows, in Corpus Christi in 1948. She shared this family recipe with my mother. Remember to leave all the fruits and nuts whole. Slice the cake thin. The slices are beautiful because you slice into the whole fruit and nuts.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 3 - 8x4 inch loaf pans and line them with parchment or waxed paper.\nBeat eggs, salt and vanilla together until very light and lemon colored. Stir in sugar, 1 cup flour and baking powder.\nPlace cherries, nuts, and dates into a large bowl. Dust with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Then stir in  sugar mixture. There is very little batter which makes this a very stiff mixture. Mix with hands.\nPress batter into prepared loaf pans. Bake for 1 hour.",
