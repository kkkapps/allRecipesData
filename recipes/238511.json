    "des": "\"Using vinaigrette as a sauce for grilled meats is one of my favorite 'cheats' of all time. They take minutes to whisk together, there's absolutely no culinary finesse required, and the combinations of oils, vinegar, and flavorings are limitless. How about balsamic vinaigrette on some grilled skirt steak? Maybe mustard dressing on some pork chops? How could grilled chicken drizzled with Greek dressing and feta cheese not be awesome?\"",
    "ins": "Whisk tarragon, 1/2 bunch mint, yogurt, 1 tablespoon olive oil, garlic, cumin, and 1 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl; pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add lamb steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nWhisk 1/4 cup olive oil, sherry vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons chopped mint and stir to combine vinaigrette.\nRemove steaks from marinade and scrape off all herbs and garlic; discard marinade. Drizzle steaks with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\nCook steaks on the preheated grill until browned on the outside and slightly pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a plate, drizzle 1/2 of the vinaigrette over the steaks, cover the steaks with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Transfer steaks to individual plates and drizzle remaining vinaigrette over each.",
