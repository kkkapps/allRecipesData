    "des": "\"This recipe was given to me for a 4th of July celebration. It has an unusual crust. Garnish with whipped cream, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nOn a flat surface, place one sheet of phyllo dough. Brush it with melted butter, and cover with another piece of phyllo. Repeat until all 8 sheets are used. Using kitchen scissors, cut layered phyllo into a 12- to 13-inch circle. Carefully press circle into a greased 9-inch pie plate; gently fan edges. Bake in preheated oven until edges are just golden, 6 to 8 minutes; cool slightly on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs until well combined. Fold in 1 cup of blueberries. Pour filling into prepared crust.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until set, 40 to 50 minutes. To prevent the crust from over-browning, gently cover pie with foil for the last 25 minutes of baking. Cool completely on a wire rack.\nIn a small bowl, beat jelly until smooth; spread over cheese filling. Arrange 1 cup blueberries on top in a star pattern.",
