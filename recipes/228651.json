    "des": "\"This magical macaroni dish will make a disappearing act on the dinner table. I've not only served it up as a main dish during the week, but I've served it as a side dish on the Thanksgiving table. It's got ham and cheese, but I think the secret ingredients are the half-and-half and eggs. Don't forget to cook the noodles with the chicken bouillon cubes for a really flavorful noodle. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.\nDissolve chicken bouillon cubes in water in a large pot; bring to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.\nLayer about half the macaroni in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; top with about half the diced smoked ham. Repeat layers.\nWhisk eggs, half-and-half, salt, and white pepper together in a bowl; pour over the noodle and ham layers. Top everything with Cheddar cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and browning around the edges, about 35 minutes.",
