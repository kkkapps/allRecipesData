I have lived in Florida my entire life and have found many Northerners fall in love with these peanuts the very first time they taste them. If you have never had peanuts from a roadside stand in Florida, then try these and you will taste what us Floridians love!\"",
    "ins": "Place peanuts, salt, pickles with brine, jalapenos, and crab boil in a large pot. Pour in water to cover the peanuts; stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until soft, at least 4 hours, adding water as needed to keep peanuts covered. Scoop peanuts out of the pot with a slotted spoon and serve hot.",
