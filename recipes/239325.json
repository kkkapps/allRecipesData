    "ins": "Toss apple, pear, peach, banana, and kiwi fruit together in a large bowl. Gently stir raspberries and blueberries into the fruit mixture. Sprinkle mint over the fruit and stir so each bit of fruit has at least a few specks of mint on it. Drizzle lime juice and triple sec over the salad and stir.",
