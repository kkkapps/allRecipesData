    "des": "\"A very easy-to-make granola recipe that is delicious and the best snack ever. All the girls at my office eat this with yogurt every day. It's awesome! If you don't have some of the dry ingredients, just add more of what you do have. Walnuts are a fine substitute for pecans. You can also try dried blueberries instead of or with the cranberries.\"",
