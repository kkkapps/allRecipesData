    "des": "\"If you are looking for a less greasy alternative, grill the meat instead of frying.  Serve with blue cheese dressing.  You can also use thighs in this recipe. Using thighs is less wasteful - no bones, no tips to throw away.  Just good eating! Serve these wings with blue cheese dressing.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer or large heavy pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCut off tips, and separate each wing at the joint. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nPlace half of the wings in the deep fryer. When the wings are golden brown and crisp, remove them and drain well. Salt wings to taste. Add remaining wings and repeat frying process. Once wings have drained a bit, place them in a large mixing bowl.\nMelt butter or margarine in a small saucepan. Mix in hot sauce and vinegar. Pour melted sauce over the cooked wings, and mix to coat the wings with sauce.",
