    "ins": "Combine panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a food processor; blend until finely crushed. Put panko mixture in a bowl.\nWhisk eggs and milk in a separate bowl to make an egg wash. Place flour in a bowl.\nCoat chicken pieces in flour; dip them into egg wash. Press into panko mixture to coat, shaking off excess.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken in batches, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 to 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
