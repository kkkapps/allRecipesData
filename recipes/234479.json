Add egg and vanilla to creamed butter mixture and mix until smooth.\nWhisk oats, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until just incorporated. Carefully fold chocolate bars into dough. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.",
