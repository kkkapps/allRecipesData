Crumble bacon.\nWhisk red wine vinegar, seasoned rice vinegar, anchovies, and white pepper together in a bowl until dressing is evenly mixed.\nHeat olive oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is transparent, 5 to 10 minutes. Lower heat to medium. Add spinach, working in batches, to onion mixture, tossing and mixing until spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes.\nTransfer spinach mixture to a serving bowl; top with egg slices and bacon.\nPour dressing into the wok; bring to just under a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour dressing over spinach mixture; sprinkle with green onions and Asiago cheese.",
