    "ins": "In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine sugar, corn syrup, vanilla extract and water.  Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar.  Heat to 250 to 265 degrees F (121 to 129 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball.\nMeanwhile, beat egg whites until stiff; slowly add gelatin while beating until stiff peaks form.  Continue beating and pour syrup mixture in a thin stream over the egg mixture.  Beat until mixture thickens and losses its gloss.  Stir in pecans.\nDrop by teaspoonfuls onto wax paper.  Cool; store in airtight containers.",
