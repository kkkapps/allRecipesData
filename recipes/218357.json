    "des": "\"All true patriots love this thick, tender meat sandwich. For anyone who loves meat and America. This is a serious recipe my great great grandfather William Abersworth created while exploring the California coast in the late 1800's. Best served with a side of curly fries.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nCut a slit down the center of a loaf of bread, and use a spoon to scoop out the interior, leaving a pocket in the loaf. Line the pocket with 2 slices of processed cheese food. Divide the cooked bacon slices in 4, and stuff each bread loaf with 1/4 of the bacon.\nPlace sliced roast beef and ham onto microwave-safe plates, and top slices with a pat of butter. Cook in microwave oven set on High until the butter has melted, about 30 seconds. Lightly stuff each loaf with 1/4 of the buttered meat slices. Top with sliced American cheese, and stuff a couple of pats of butter into the top of each loaf.\nUse remaining butter to spread over the outside of each loaf. Generously drizzle dollops of Dijon mustard and mayonnaise over the top of the stuffing.\nPlace loaves on a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until the bread is toasted and the filling is hot and melted, about 30 minutes. Watch carefully to avoid burning bread.\nHeat the gravy to a simmer over low heat; remove sandwiches from oven, slice into serving portions, and top each serving with a generous helping of hot gravy.",
