    "des": "\"This is AMAZING! Very popular, simple dish made in Egyptian households. Once you make it, it will become a favorite for sure. When finished, you should have super tender beef with a thick oniony sauce. The onions will have cooked down to a thick rich sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Combine beef, butter, and canola in a large saucepan; cook and stir beef over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onions, chicken bouillon, bay leaf, salt, and pepper to beef; pour in water. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until beef is tender and onions have reduced into a thick sauce, at least 2 hours.",
