    "ins": "In a large stockpot, cover sweet potatoes with 1 inch of water; boil for 20 minutes, or until fork tender.  Drain, allow to cool and remove skins.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or butter one 2 quart casserole dish.\nPlace potatoes in a mixing bowl and with an electric mixer, beat on low speed until potatoes begin to break up. Increase speed to medium high and blend until smooth.\nReduce speed to low and add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, eggs and salt. Mix well.\nAllow any potato 'fibers' to remain on the beater and remove. Pour sweet potato mixture into the casserole dish.\nPrepare the topping in a small bowl by whisking together the brown sugar, flour, butter and pecans. Sprinkle mixture over potato mixture and bake for 40 minutes.",
