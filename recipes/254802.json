    "des": "\"I've done a lot of experimenting with flourless pancakes and came up with this version recently. So far these are my favorite! They taste best with maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream on top if you have some handy. My kids like to use cookie cutters to make shapes out of these pancakes before they gobble them up. Enjoy!\"",
