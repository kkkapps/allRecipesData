    "des": "\"This is a fast, simple, easy recipe great for when you need to throw something together on a weeknight. You can use either pork steaks or pork chops with this. They stay moist and are super flavorful with soy and teriyaki being the main ingredients. I like to serve this over jasmine rice. We use the leftover sauce on top. I also make a side of green beans mixed with soy sauce and sesame seeds. It's a meal even my 4-year-old loves!\"",
    "ins": "Mix together soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, aji mirin, garlic, and ginger in a large resealable plastic bag. Place pork steaks into marinade, knead several times to coat meat, and squeeze out air. Seal bag and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove pork steaks from marinade and discard used marinade. Place pork steaks into a large baking dish and cover dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; uncover dish and bake until juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest steak reads at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 10 more minutes.",
