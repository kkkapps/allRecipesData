    "des": "\"This is a hearty all-in-one-meal soup which contains vegetables, meat, and pasta. Served with mozzarella-garlic bread, makes a great meal on a cold winter day.  This is a variation of a soup made with beef.  I like venison because it is non-fat. Garnish with your favorite cheese.\"",

Bring to a boil, and then simmer for about 30 minutes.\nStir in beans, carrots, and zucchini.  Simmer soup for 90 minutes.\nAdd pasta, and cook until tender. Top individual servings with grated cheese, and serve.",
