    "des": "\"I first tasted this tea in a popular Italian restaurant in my college hometown of Kailua. I have been craving it ever since, and have experimented with a few proportions. Add more tea leaves for a stronger tea, but do not steep longer or the tea will end up tasting bitter. (If it does, add a pinch of baking soda.)  Always make something to your liking! This is also great to serve at showers.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the barely boiling hot water into a large pitcher, and add the tea bags. Steep the tea 2 to 4 minutes. Remove the tea bags, and pour in the ice water. Pour in the pineapple juice. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 1 1/2 hours.\nPour the tea over ice, garnish with pineapple spears, and serve.",
