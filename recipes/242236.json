Measure 1 cup smashed mango, reserving the rest for the glaze.\nBeat 1 cup smashed mango, cake mix, eggs, water, vegetable oil, and lime zest together in a bowl using an electric mixer for 2 minutes; pour into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool cake in pan for 5 minutes. Invert cake onto a wire rack to cool completely.\nCombine butter, lime juice, about 1 tablespoon reserved juice from mango, and rum together in a bowl.
