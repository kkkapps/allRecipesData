    "ins": "Place potatoes in a saucepan, fill with water to cover the potatoes, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the potatoes until tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow potatoes to cool.\nWhile potatoes are cooking, combine olive oil, butter, balsamic vinegar, garlic, rosemary, sage, thyme, savory, sea salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir with a fork to combine well.\nPreheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPlace the potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, and lightly press down on the potatoes to partially crush them. Spoon the oil-herb mixture over each potato.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges of the potatoes are beginning to crisp, about 25 minutes. Cool for about 5 minutes before serving.",
