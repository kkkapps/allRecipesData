    "des": "\"This hearty slow cooker dinner will fill your kitchen with a delicious aroma and isn't that same old chicken and cream-of-something slow cooker meal. Serve it with a crisp green salad and a loaf of crunchy bread for a stick-to-your-ribs dinner. This tastes better the longer it cooks, so letting it cook on Low for an entire work day will only improve the taste.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the sausage until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes.\nStir in the onion; cook and stir until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.\nRemove the sausages, and cut them into 1 1/2-inch to 2-inch pieces.\nPour the beef stock, tomatoes, tomato puree, and hot sauce into the skillet with the onion and bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom.\nPlace the carrots into a slow cooker, followed by the garbanzo beans and kidney beans.\nArrange the sausage pieces on top.\nPour the sauce from the skillet into the slow cooker.\nCook on Low for 4 to 6 hours.",
