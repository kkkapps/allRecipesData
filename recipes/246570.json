    "des": "\"Two different types of peas, along with radishes and a dill vinaigrette, give this salad a fresh spring flavor.  Vary the mix of peas as you wish; maybe you like snow peas better than sugar snaps? And if you're really feeling frisky, add some pea shoots!\"",
    "ins": "Remove strings from sugar snap peas. Cut each snap pea or snow pea pod diagonally into thirds.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add wheat berries, reduce heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still chewy, about 1 hour. Stir in sugar snaps and frozen peas and cook 1 minute. Drain wheat berry mixture in a large colander and rinse under cold water. Drain well. Transfer wheat berry mixture to a large bowl and let cool, about 30 minutes. Stir in green onions and radishes.\nWhisk together lemon juice, mustard, salt, and sugar until sugar is dissolved. Whisk in oil. Pour dressing over salad and toss well. Add dill and toss to combine.",
