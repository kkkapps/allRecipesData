    "des": "\"This spectacular pastry Christmas tree is easier to make than you might think. Just follow this step-by-step recipe! Indulgent Nutella\u00c2\u00ae chocolate hazelnut spread is sandwiched between two layers of puff pasty, scored in all the right places then twisted to form tree branches. Ideal for Christmas parties and delicious washed down with some festive mulled wine.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with coconut oil.\nCut puff pastry in half; roll into two 11x13-inch sheets on a lightly floured surface.\nPlace 1 puff pastry sheet on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly score puff pastry into the shape of a triangle with a wide base. Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread over the triangle in a thin layer with the back of a spoon.\nRoll up the second sheet of puff pastry and place on the tip of the triangle; roll down to cover the chocolate spread. Score top puff pastry sheet into a triangle; cut out carefully to avoid tearing aluminum foil. Pull away excess pastry.\nCut away 2 strips at the bottom of the triangle to form the base of a tree trunk. Score 2 lines down the middle of the triangle to form a tree trunk that is narrower at the top and gets wider towards the base. Using the trunk as a guide, cut branches into the sides of the triangle.\nTwist the branches away from you, trying to get in 2 turns on the lower branches. Continue moving up the tree, twisting away from you as you go.\nCut a small star out of the excess pastry; place on top of the tree. Brush the star and tree with beaten egg.\nBake in the preheated oven until puffy and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Slide onto a serving plate, using a piece of parchment paper if needed.",
