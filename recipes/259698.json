    "ins": "Mix barbeque sauce, honey, and ranch dressing together in a large bowl. Dip wings in the sauce until coated. Transfer wings to a 6-quart slow cooker; pour any remaining sauce on top. Cook on High until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
