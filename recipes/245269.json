    "des": "\"Naturally sweetened by honey, this delectable treat is definitely a must-have! Amaranth flour gives it a special nutty taste, but please note this is not a crunchy cookie: it'll turn out cake-like, with a soft-dough texture. It's easy to make and adds simple pleasure to life! Serve them with milk or simple enjoy them on their own!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat butter and honey together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture, beating on low speed after each addition. Add crushed corn flakes, baking powder, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt; mix well to combine.\nBeat amaranth flour and whole wheat flour into corn flakes mixture, 1 cup at a time, on low speed, until a semi-soft dough forms. Test the dough by rolling a small piece into a ball; add more flour if it sticks to your fingers.\nRoll dough into tablespoon-size balls using your hands. Flatten slightly and press one side into sprinkles. Place cookies 1-inch apart on baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until top is slightly golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack to cool completely.",
