    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook shell pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 12 minutes; drain.\nHeat an oven-safe Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef with the onion soup mix in the pot until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir tomato sauce, whole kernel corn, and cream-style corn into the beef; add drained shell pasta and stir.\nTransfer Dutch oven to the preheated oven and bake for 23 minutes. Stir casserole, top with cheese, and continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.",
