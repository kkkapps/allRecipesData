    "des": "\"This is a basic garlic oil that can be used as a dipping sauce for bread, the oil half of an Italian vinaigrette, or as the base for Mediterranean-style cooking. If you use it for the latter, though, you may want to omit the herbs and add the extra-virgin olive oil unless your pan is non-stick or you do not mind burned little flecks of oregano and parsley.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Pour olive oil into skillet gradually, sliding skillet away from burner if oil begins to splatter. Add garlic; cook until sizzling but not brown, about 1 minute. Turn off heat, leaving skillet on burner. Stir in extra-virgin olive oil, basil, and oregano. Transfer to container and store in refrigerator until flavors blend, 8 hours to overnight.",
