    "des": "\"My favorite way to dazzle in a hurry, these shrimp take minutes to make. Full of flavor, they take the center stage at any meal, but I am also known to throw them in a fresh garden salad as well. I do tend to always use the largest shrimp I can get my hands on, they seem to have the best flavor to them! Once complete, feel free to serve immediately over pasta, with warm crusty bread and a garden salad, or with a rice dish. This one compliments them all!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; cook and stir the garlic in the oil until translucent. Sprinkle the red pepper flakes and paprika into the oil. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Pour the lemon juice over the shrimp; allow to cook until the shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 1 to 2 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium-low; add the basil and toss lightly. Season with salt and pepper to serve.",
