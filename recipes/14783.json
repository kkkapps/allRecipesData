Note: This recipe makes about 3 1/2 quarts sauce, enough for 4 pounds of spaghetti; since you may not need such a large quantity of spaghetti, freeze extra sauce in half-pint, pint or quart freezer jars and use as needed. Or give the sauce as a gift to a special friend, co-worker, relative or neighbor!\"",
