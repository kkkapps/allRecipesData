    "des": "\"Pork chops are rolled around apple and cheese before cooking on the stovetop. This is a great autumn dish that is wonderful served with brown rice.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, toss together the Cheddar cheese and apple. Lay out the pork chops and spread a thin layer of the cheese mixture on top of each one. Roll them up and secure with toothpicks.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly brown the outsides of the chops, then pour in the vinegar and water. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for about 30 minutes.\nMix the flour with a small amount of the liquid from the chops. Stir into the skillet until completely dissolved, then simmer for a few minutes, stirring constantly, to make a quick gravy.",
