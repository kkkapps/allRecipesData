    "des": "\"Zesty and sweet, this unique pasta salad melds the flavors of barbeque chicken, pasta, and freshly diced vegetables for a delicious summer meal.  Can also be made without the chicken or with less, for a side dish.\"",
    "ins": "Place the chicken breasts into a saucepan over medium-low heat, and pour in 1 cup of barbeque sauce. Simmer the chicken until the meat is no longer pink inside, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool, and dice chicken meat.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the shell pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Rinse pasta with cold water until chilled, and drain again thoroughly.\nIn a large salad bowl, whisk 1 cup of barbeque sauce with mayonnaise until thoroughly combined. Mix in the cumin, then stir in cooked chicken. Place cooked pasta, jicama, red and orange bell peppers, corn, cilantro, black beans, jalapeno peppers, and red onion into the salad bowl, and gently fold to combine with the dressing. Serve warm or chilled.",
