    "des": "\"I got this recipe from another 'blue ribbon junkie' friend of mine years ago. It is very firm and very fine textured. It is the only cake I use when doing cake sculpting, and works very well in the 2 piece cake molds. The lowest ribbon it has ever worn, when entered into baking competitions is a Blue Ribbon, and it has gotten as high as Best of Show at a State Fair.\"",

Continue beating and add 7 eggs, one at a time; beating well after each egg\nIn a separate bowl, mix together flour and cornstarch.  Beat half of the flour mixture into the egg and sugar mixture.\nBeat in 1/2 cup whipping cream, and then beat in the remainder of the flour mixture.
