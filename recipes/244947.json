    "ins": "Place chicken in a single layer in a large pot and add enough chicken stock to cover; season with paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper. Bring stock to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. Shred chicken.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Arrange noodles on a sheet of aluminum foil or parchment paper and spray with cooking spray to prevent sticking.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir celery and onion until just starting to soften, about 5 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine onion mixture and shredded chicken in a bowl; add about 1/3 the buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese and mix well.\nMix ricotta cheese, blue cheese dressing, and remaining buffalo wing sauce in a separate bowl; season with salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Stir egg into mixture.\nSpread a layer of ricotta mixture in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with a layer of 3 noodles. Spread 1/4 of the remaining ricotta mixture over noodle layer; top with 1/3 the chicken mixture, and 1/4 the mozzarella cheese. Layer 3 lasagna noodles over cheese layer and repeat layering 2 times more ending with a layer of ricotta mixture and mozzarella cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until cooked through and top is lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Cool lasagna at least 20 minutes before cutting.",
