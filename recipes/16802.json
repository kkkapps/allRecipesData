Cook wings on the preheated grill until they are very crispy. Turn the wings frequently as they will burn easily.\nWhile the wings are grilling, in a large bowl, combine both hot sauces with garlic powder, Parmesan cheese and melted butter.\nWhen the wings are finished cooking, place them in the large bowl of hot sauce mixture and stir until they are coated.",
