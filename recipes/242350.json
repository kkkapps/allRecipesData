    "des": "\"I made this using rhubarb and raspberries from the garden. You could use different fruit, and substitute toasted hazelnuts for macadamia nuts or leave out the nuts and chocolate for something more traditional. Serve with ice cream, cream, or custard. I used single cream spiked with vanilla and a tablespoon of sugar.\"",
