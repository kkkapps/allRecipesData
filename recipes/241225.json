    "des": "\"I've practiced with coconut flour in many dishes. Don't let the unconventional type of flour fool you, it is very easy to work with! I've decided to share this, since not many others have submitted a Paleo-friendly crepe recipe. I strive to inspire, especially now that Valentine's Day is up here soon. Treat your lover with breakfast in bed with these amazing dessert-like crepes! Add Nutella\u00c2\u00ae, bananas, or anything you want to your heart's content! These are super easy and healthier than the conventional crepe. Great for those that are looking for more fiber and in a Paleo diet.\"",
    "ins": "Beat egg whites, almond milk, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; add coconut flour, baking powder, and sea salt and continue to beat until no clumps remain. Let the mixture sit for 8 minutes.\nHeat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour about 1/3 of the batter into the pan. Tilt the pan so the batter covers the bottom of the skillet to all sides. Cook until the edges begin to slightly lift and the bottom is slightly browned, about 2 minutes; flip and cook until the other side is browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.",
