    "des": "\"This is my friend Jennifer's recipe that she uses a lot for any function that requires food. Everyone loves these so much that I asked for the recipe. The key to making these taste so good is to cook them so the cheese melts but the rolls do not get toasted. These are also good using roast beef and Havarti cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpray a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nSlice each roll almost all the way through, but keeping the top attached. Arrange rolls on prepared baking sheet.\nStir honey mustard dressing into melted butter until well blended.\nBrush butter mixture inside each roll using a pastry brush, making sure to get the top and bottom.\nPlace a layer of Swiss cheese and ham into each roll.\nClose each roll and brush the top with butter mixture. Sprinkle the top of each roll with sesame seeds.\nBake rolls in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 5 to 6 minutes.",
