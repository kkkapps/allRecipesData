    "des": "\"Delightfully spicy finger food. It's a great appetizer for parties. I actually won a chili pepper cooking contest with this. A food processor is useful for chopping the peppers, onion and garlic. For the frozen mixed vegetables, I prefer a bag containing corn, beans and red peppers. Bon appetit!\"",
