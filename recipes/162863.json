    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil.\nBrush the mushroom on both sides with olive oil and place gill-side up onto the baking sheet. Drizzle with any remaining olive oil, and the red wine vinegar. Sprinkle with sliced garlic and shallot; season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with the piece of roasted red pepper, and wrap the foil tightly around the mushroom.\nBake in preheated oven until the mushroom is tender, about 30 minutes.\nToss the arugula with Romano cheese and salad dressing. Place onto a plate and top with the hot mushroom and pepper. Dig in!",
