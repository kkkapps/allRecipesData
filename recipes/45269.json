Transfer to a large mixing bowl, and set aside.\nIn a skillet, cook garlic in 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat until lightly browned. Transfer to a small bowl. Stir  in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the vinegar, sugar, oregano, and basil until well blended and sugar is dissolved. Pour over the eggplant, and toss to coat.
