It has been a go-to recipe for my family for all these years and I thought I should share it with my cooking community.\"",

Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.\nCombine 1/2 cup water, olive oil, honey, and salt in a separate bowl; add 1 cup flour and mix well. Mix yeast mixture into flour mixture. Add remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough is well combined.\nKnead dough on a floured work surface until dough is soft, smooth, and elastic, about 8 minutes. Roll dough into 4 calzone shapes.",
