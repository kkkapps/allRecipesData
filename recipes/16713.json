    "des": "\"These are wonderful vegetarian meatballs with a sweet and sour sauce.  They're simple to make and they disappear very quickly.  Make these for Christmas holiday parties. If you don't have veggie burger patties, you may use TVP, textured vegetable protein, that's available at most health food stores.\"",
