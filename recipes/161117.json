    "des": "\"My good friend Lin gave me a recipe for beef in oyster sauce, I misread the amount of black pepper called for in her recipe, and the result was fantastic! I especially like the recipe because no soy sauce is used. My husband likes to eat them with the leftover sliced uncooked onion to bring out the sweetness of the oyster sauce.\"",
