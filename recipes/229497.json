    "des": "\"This is a low-fat favorite in my household. The bok choy and shiitake complement each other perfectly. Best of all, it's fast and easy to make! If you are watching your sodium intake, use low-sodium soy sauce. I also like to use the sauce from this dish as a dip for boiled eggs. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Pour soy sauce and mushroom stock into a large skillet over high heat; whisk in miso paste and oyster sauce until dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Add bok choy and mushrooms; bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover skillet, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.",
