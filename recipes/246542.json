    "des": "\"This is a great recipe for fresh asparagus. Very simple and kids as well as adults love it. The buttered bread on top gives it just enough crunch, and the cheese it what makes the kids ask for seconds.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 1/2 inch water to a boil in a saucepan. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.\nSpread a thin layer of butter onto each bread slice. Cut bread into cubes.\nStir cream of mushroom soup, processed cheese food, and 2/3 of buttered bread cubes together in a bowl; stir in asparagus. Transfer asparagus mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with remaining bread cubes.\nBake in the preheated oven until bread is golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
