    "des": "\"Garlic-studded, herb-rubbed pork shoulder is such a great cut of meat. I cooked it in a pan without liquid, without covering it, and without cooking it at a really low temperature. I didn't want it to be falling apart and wet; I wanted it to be solid, chewy and crusty.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCut about 6 holes per side into pork roast with a sharp knife and insert garlic clove halves into the holes. Rub roast with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season all sides of roast with kosher salt and a generous amount of black pepper, Italian seasoning, rosemary, and cayenne pepper. Place into a roasting pan.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Turn off the oven with roast inside and leave it to rest for 1 hour. Refrigerate meat overnight.\nCut cold pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices. If any garlic appears on the cut surface of the meat, pick it out so it doesn't burn. Season slices with salt.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat and sear pork slices in the hot oil until browned and crusty, about 10 minutes per side.\nToss lettuce with tomatoes in a bowl and drizzle with red wine vinegar; toss again to coat.\nHeat beans in a saucepan over low heat. Layer about 1/3 cup white beans into a large, shallow soup plate; top beans with a slice of pork shoulder and about 1/4 cup lettuce mixture.",
