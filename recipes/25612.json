    "des": "\"This is one of the best pound cakes I've ever tasted. It's simple to make, starting with a store bought mix.  I often take one to work where it quickly disappears.  I also use this recipe at Christmas time to make 6 small loaves for gifts, which take about 15 minutes less.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and lemon extract. Beat in water and sour cream. Beat in the cake mix and flour. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for 60 to 80 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.",
