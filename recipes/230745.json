    "des": "\"Easy barbecue chicken and potato dish. I prepare this on Sunday morning, and it is ready when we get home from church. It is hearty, and we never have leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nArrange chicken breasts, potatoes, and onion in a large baking dish.\nMix ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, margarine, lemon juice, dry mustard, salt, paprika, chili powder, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve brown sugar and salt. Pour the sauce over chicken and vegetables. Cover dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink, the juices run clear, and the sauce has thickened, about 2 hours. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
