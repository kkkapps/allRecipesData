    "des": "\"Potatoes are coated in a spicy mixture of corn flour and Cajun seasoning then deep fried until crispy.  Very simple and really crunchy.   I like mine extra spicy so I soak my cut potatoes in hot sauce for a few seconds before shaking them in the dry batter.\"",
    "ins": "Place cut potatoes into a large bowl of cold water. Soak for 10 minutes.  In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the corn flour, corn meal, and Cajun seasoning.  Shake the bag to blend. Drain the potatoes, but leave them wet. Place the fries in the plastic bag with the seasoning, and shake to coat.\nHeat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCook fries in hot oil for 7 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the fryer to paper towels to drain. Season with a small amount of salt.",
