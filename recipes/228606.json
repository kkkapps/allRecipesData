    "des": "\"This is a great recipe for any meat marinade. Also a wonderful stir fry sauce. Marinate your choice of meat or vegetables for 4 to 24 hours; grill to your liking. Can be refrigerated for 2 weeks. The better quality soy sauce you use, the better your final product will be. Sauce can always be thinned with water if desired.\"",
