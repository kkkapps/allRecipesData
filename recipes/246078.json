    "des": "\"This is a Kerala (Southern India) rendition of coconut rice. It's a tad sweeter than regular rice which cuts through much of the spice found in an accompaniment of a spicy curry such as chicken curry.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 1 cup coconut water to a boil in a saucepan. Add basmati rice and salt, cover, and reduce heat to simmer. Stir occasionally, adding more coconut water as needed, until rice is soft but not mushy, about 15 minutes.\nRemove rice from heat, stir in cilantro and butter, and cover again. Let stand until coconut water is absorbed and flavors have blended, about 5 minutes more.",
