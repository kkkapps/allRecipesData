You can use left over potatoes from last night's supper or just throw a potato in the microwave for 5 minutes, cool, and add butter and a little salt (no pepper please). The powdered sugar and peanut butter filling goes so well together. The potatoes help the candy hold it's shape and give it substance.\"",
