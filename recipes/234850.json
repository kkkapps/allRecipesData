    "des": "\"This is a combination of several pork recipes. The lemon/lime juice makes it absolutely divine, and the apples and bacon complements the tenderloin beautifully. Serve with wild rice, corn, or zucchini patties.\"",
    "ins": "Season pork tenderloins with salt and black pepper.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tenderloins in hot oil until browned on each side, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat and cool.\nPreheat oven to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C).\nStir juice from 1/2 lemon, sage, and lemon zest together in a bowl until a paste forms; spread paste over each tenderloin.\nWrap bacon strips around each tenderloin and place in a baking dish. Scatter apples around tenderloins and drizzle juice of 2 lemons over meat and apples.\nCook pork in the preheated oven until apples are tender and pork is slightly pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
