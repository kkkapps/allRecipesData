    "ins": "Place the beaten eggs in a wide, shallow bowl, and set aside. Place the grated Romano cheese in a wide, shallow dish, and set aside.\nSpread the goat cheese onto one side of each slice of bread. Sandwich two tomato slices between two pieces of bread, then dip both sides into the beaten egg. Allow the excess to drip off, then press the sandwiches into the grated Romano cheese, coating well on each side; set aside. Repeat to make 4 sandwiches.\nHeat a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook the sandwiches until golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes per side.",
