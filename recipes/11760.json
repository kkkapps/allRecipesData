    "des": "\"An easier version of an Italian favorite, using instant mashed potatoes.  This recipe can easily be double, tripled, etc.  I make multiple batches, and freeze. To freeze, put on cookie sheets until frozen, and then put into plastic bags.  Serve with your favorite spaghetti sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Place potato flakes in a medium-size bowl.  Pour in boiling water; stir until blended.  Let cool.\nStir in egg, salt, and pepper.  Blend in enough flour to make a fairly stiff dough. Turn dough out on a well floured board.  Knead lightly.\nDivide dough in half. Shape each half into a long thin roll, the thickness of a breadstick.  With a knife dipped in flour, cut into bite-size pieces.\nPlace a few gnocchi in boiling water. As the gnocchi rise to the top of the pot, remove them with a slotted spoon.  Repeat until all are cooked.",
