    "des": "\"Marzipan can be a great cover for a cake, or cut out fun shapes to decorate cakes, cookies, or eat alone.  You will need a little frosting to glue the marzipan to a cookie or cake and it can make for a yummy treat.  It is especially yummy on a cake with cream and a little bit of your choice of jam between the layers!\"",
    "ins": "Break the almond paste into small pieces over a medium bowl. Add 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar, and work it in with your hands until incorporated. It will be crumbly. Add another 3/4 cup of sugar, and work it in really well. Pour in the corn syrup, and work it in until evenly blended. Spread remaining sugar out on a clean work surface, and knead the dough until smooth and uniform, 3 to 5 minutes. If the dough seems too sticky, knead in more sugar. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about an hour. It should have the consistency of modeling dough.\nBreak off small pieces of marzipan to color, kneading in color thoroughly until you arrive at the desired color. Then blend the colored pieces into larger portions of dough. Dust a work surface and rolling pin with confectioners' sugar, and roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using small cookie cutters to make candies.",
