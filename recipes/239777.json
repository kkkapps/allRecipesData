Drain carrots, reserving 1/4 cup of the orange juice.\nReturn carrots and reserved juice to the pan and place over medium heat. Stir honey, apricot preserves, Dijon mustard, butter, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper with the carrots and juice; cook and stir until sugar dissolves completely and the carrots are glazed and tender, about 10 minutes.",
