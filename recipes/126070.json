    "des": "\"A venison spin on a classic dish my mother used to make.  A wonderful dish. This is an oven dish, though a slow cooker or stovetop cooking can be done with this dish. It's wonderful served over rice or noodles.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nToss venison cubes with flour to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons of canola oil to smoking in a large skillet. Add venison, and cook until well browned, then remove and set aside. Pour in remaining 1 tablespoon of canola oil; when hot, add mushrooms and cook until softened then stir in onion and cook until softened.\nStir in the reserved venison, then add tomato sauce, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Pour into a casserole dish, cover, and bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.\nStir in sour cream and continue cooking until venison is tender, about 30 minutes longer.",
