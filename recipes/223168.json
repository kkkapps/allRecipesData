    "des": "\"Super simple yet delicious and beautiful, this grape tomato salad rounds out any meal adding loads of bright red color and tantalizing flavor. Sweetened rice vinegar adds a bit of sugar and acid, and the olive oil helps the body to absorb the lycopene in the tomatoes. Hint: replace the oregano with another dried spice that compliments your meal.\"",
    "ins": "Mix tomatoes, olive oil, rice vinegar, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Crumble oregano between fingers to release flavor and add to the tomatoes; stir to coat. Season with salt. Let flavors marinate before serving, 5 minutes or up to an hour.",
