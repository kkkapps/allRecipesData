    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, and melted butter until well blended. Reserve 1/2 cup of crumb mixture for the top of pie. Press remaining crumb mixture into a 9-inch pie plate.\nIn the top of a double boiler, mix the egg yolks, 1/2 cup white sugar, the cornstarch and salt. Very slowly and gradually and while stirring constantly, add the milk. Continue to stir until the mixture come to a boil or the mixture becomes thick and smooth. Pour into pie crust.\nIn a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/4 cup white sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pie, covering completely. Sprinkle reserved crumb mixture over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven for 5 to 10 minutes, or until meringue is golden brown in spots.
