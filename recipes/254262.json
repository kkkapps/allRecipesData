    "des": "\"If you have ever wanted to make great authentic Japanese noodle house ramen, this recipe is for you. Great for singles with some cooking experience and a great everyday meal. Might take longer than the overall time without cooking experience. I rarely measure the amount of each ingredient due to the high number of small measurements used to save time.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and let cool.\nPour sesame oil into a large skillet. Add pork slices. Cover pork with half the olive oil, sesame seeds, basil, and sage. Flip and cover pork with remaining olive oil, sesame seeds, basil, and sage.\nCook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Add ramen noodles; cook for 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.\nStir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into the noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a bowl.\nPeel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Top noodles with egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.",
