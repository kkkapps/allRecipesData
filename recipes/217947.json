    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, garam masala, curry powder, and salt into the onion and garlic; cook together until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the potatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and raisins to the pot. Pour enough water over the mixture to cover; bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.\nAdd the chickpeas and kale to the pot; simmer until the kale wilts, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro over the stew and immediately remove the pot from the heat.",
