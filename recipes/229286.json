Fold in raspberries and white chocolate chips; spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.\nMix 5 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon raspberry extract in a bowl. Use a pastry cutter to chop 2 tablespoons butter into mixture until it resembles a coarse crumble; sprinkle over muffins.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 21 minutes.",
