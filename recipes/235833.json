    "des": "\"This cool, easy, yummy pie with the combination of chocolate and mint always goes fast! It's perfect for Christmas or New Year's and a great way to get rid of those leftover candy canes. Variations include adding instant coffee instead of peppermint sticks for a mocha flavor, adding 3 tablespoons creme de menthe and 2 tablespoons creme de cocoa for a grasshopper pie, or adding Dutch chocolate mix for a double chocolate pie.\"",
    "ins": "Mix cookie crumbs and butter together in a bowl; press into a pie plate. Refrigerate pie crust until chilled, at least 30 minutes.\nHeat marshmallows and milk together in a saucepan over medium-low heat until melted and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool. Fold crushed peppermint candy into marshmallow mixture.\nBeat cream in a glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until medium peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed should curl over slightly. Fold whipped cream into marshmallow mixture; pour into pie crust. Chill until set, at least 2 hours.",
