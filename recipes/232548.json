    "des": "\"I had never had chicken corn soup until I moved to south central Pennsylvania. It is often found at local fairs and festivals and is now my favorite comfort food. This is a quick and easy version that shaves quite a bit of time and effort from the traditional method but tastes pretty close to the real thing.\"",
    "ins": "Pour chicken broth into a large soup pot and place over medium heat. Add chicken and any accumulated juices from the chicken to the broth. Stir corn, dry soup mix, and chicken soup base into broth mixture. Simmer soup for 20 minutes. Add noodles to soup and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.",
