    "ins": "Stir baking mix, milk, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until batter is smooth; fold in banana and chocolate chips until just combined.\nHeat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle a few drops water in skillet; they will dance and disappear when skillet is ready.\nSpoon just under 1/4 cup batter into the pan; cook until bubbles appear on the top of each pancake and bottom is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip each pancake and cook until bottom is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
