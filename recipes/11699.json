    "ins": "Scrub mussels and pull off beards, cutting them at the base with a paring knife.  Discard those that do not close when you handle them and any with broken shells.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve.\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet place 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, onion, garlic, parsley, bay leaf, thyme and wine.  Bring to a boil and lower heat; cook for 2 minutes.  Add mussels; cover and cook just until they open, 3 to 4 minutes.  Do not overcook.\nDivide pasta into 4 bowls and spoon mussels over noodles.\nStrain mussel liquid, and return to pot.  Add remaining butter or margarine and heat until it melts.  Pour over mussels and serve.",
