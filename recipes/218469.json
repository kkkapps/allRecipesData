    "des": "\"My kids and the rest of their rowing team love these wraps. At their regattas, which last from sun-up to sun-down, we moms have to feed over 100 people (50 'starving' teenagers and their families). We assemble the wraps outside on portable tables and mix the coleslaw in a huge 20 gallon storage container! Several moms form an assembly line to build the wraps. We then roll them in paper and store them in coolers for lunch and snacking all day long. They hold up well and the leftovers are still good the next day!\"",
    "ins": "Combine the cabbage, carrots, 1/2 cup salad dressing, and cider vinegar in a large bowl.\nSpread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon salad dressing (optional). Line each wrap with one lettuce leaf and arrange 3 ounces of turkey down the center of the lettuce. Place 2 cheese slices on top of the turkey. Top with 3/4 cup of the cabbage mixture.\nFold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges.  Roll the wrap up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Wrap in paper sandwich wrappers or plastic wrap, and store in refrigerator until serving. Before serving, cut each wrap in half across the middle with a slightly diagonal cut.",
