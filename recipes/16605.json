In a large skillet over medium low heat, combine the meat with 2 cups reserved broth and allow to simmer.\nIn a separate skillet over medium heat, combine the cornmeal, milk, corn, tomatoes and eggs. Stir well and add the chili powder, cayenne pepper and salt. Let cook for 20 minutes, stirring often. Add broth as needed if mixture gets too thick. Combine this mixture with the pork in a 9x13 inch baking dish, mixing together well.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)  for 30 to 45 minutes.",
