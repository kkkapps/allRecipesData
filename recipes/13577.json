    "des": "\"This is my favorite recipe to make for the holidays.  It tastes too good to be this easy.  If you don't make your own dough, simply use dough mix or refrigerated crusts - it will taste just as delicious.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together cherry pie filling, cranberry sauce, raisins, cornstarch and ginger.\nMake pie-crust dough, substituting orange juice for water.  Divide dough 55 % / 45 %.  Roll larger piece to 1 1/2 inches larger than 9-inch pie pan.  Place crust in pie plate leaving one inch overhang, and brush with egg white.  Spoon cherry filling into pie crust.\nRoll second crust to 12-inch round.  Cut into 14 strips to make a lattice top.  Moisten edge of bottom crust with water.  Place 7 strips across pie.  Do not seal ends.  Fold every other strip back halfway from center.  Place center cross strip on pie and replace folded part of strips.  Now fold back alternate strips. Place second cross strip in place.  Repeat to weave cross strips into lattice. Seal ends.  Turn bottom crust edge up over ends of strips.  Pinch to seal.   Make high fluted edge.  Brush pastry with milk, and sprinkle lightly with sugar.\nBake at 400 degrees C (205 degrees C) for 50 minutes, or until fruit begins to bubble and crust is golden brown.  Cool pie slightly on wire rack.",
