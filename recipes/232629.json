    "des": "\"Good for lunch or dinner, this warm-weather pasta salad is a complete meal when served over a bed of lettuce with a side of fresh sliced garden tomatoes and warm garlic breadsticks. I usually add more curry powder than the recipe calls for.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook chicken breasts in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Rinse chicken in cold water to cool, cut into small chunks, and refrigerate to cool completely.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook shell pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until cool; drain.\nStir mayonnaise, yogurt, and curry powder together in a large bowl. Add cold chicken, cold pasta, peas, radish slices, and green onion slices; stir to combine.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving.",
