    "des": "\"When we had our restaurant, one of our specials on Thursday night was polenta and chicken. We always had polenta left over and Dad would complain about the waste. I came up with this idea and boy did it take off! Johnny would grill a slice of polenta on the grill and then add sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and onions and then top it with a little sauce and mozzarella.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil on a griddle or large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, sausage, and mushrooms until sausage is fully cooked and onions are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from griddle.\nPlace polenta on the same hot griddle; cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes per side. Layer polenta with vegetable-sausage mixture, spaghetti sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Cook on griddle until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 minutes.",
