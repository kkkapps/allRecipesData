    "des": "\"Easy applesauce recipe that uses the spicy cinnamon flavor of Red Hots\u00c2\u00ae. The color is fun too! Your family will love it. Depending on the sweetness of the apples, consider adding less sugar or none at all. Enjoy right away or freeze for up to 6 months.\"",
    "ins": "Combine apples and water in a large pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir cinnamon candies and sugar into the apples and water; return mixture to a simmer and cook until the candies melt, about 15 minutes. Remove pot from heat and set aside until the mixture cools, about 15 minutes.\nMash apples with a potato masher until no large chunks remain. Alternately, you can blend the mixture with an immersion blender to get a smoother applesauce.",
