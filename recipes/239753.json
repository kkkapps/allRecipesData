Soak each sandwich in the milk mixture until the bread is moistened, about 15 seconds per side.\nPrepare a nonstick pan with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.\nCook sandwiches in the hot pan until browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip sandwiches and continue cooking until other side is browned, about 1 minute more.",
