    "des": "\"This recipe is a major hit, always. \n\nIf you want to use regular flour instead of the gluten-free, it will work very well. I did it that way for 30 years before we went gluten-free. Serve warm or at room temperature. I serve it with vanilla kefir from Grace Harbor Farms\u00c2\u00ae on the top.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMelt butter in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add sugar and rhubarb; cook until rhubarb is soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.\nMix gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add yogurt, coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract; stir thoroughly until batter is combined.\nDrop cake batter over rhubarb mixture in the skillet. Spread it out gently until mostly smooth.\nBake in the preheated oven until top is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.\nRun a knife around the edges, place a plate on top and carefully invert cake onto the plate.",
