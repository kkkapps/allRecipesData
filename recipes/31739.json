    "ins": "Place the onions, egg substitute, and flour into separate shallow bowls. In another shallow bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, cayenne, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes.\nHeat oil in a heavy skillet or deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Dip rings of onion into flour, then into the egg substitute, and then into the bread crumb mixture, shaking off any excess after each dip. Carefully drop each onion ring into the hot oil, and fry for about 30 seconds on each side, or until golden. Remove from hot oil to paper towels to drain. Serve hot with lots of ketchup.",
