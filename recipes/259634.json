    "ins": "Combine tuna, mayonnaise, chopped egg, onion, pickle chips, and salt in a bowl to make tuna-egg salad.\nPlace tomatoes on a flat work surface. Cut slits from the top towards the bottom to make partial wedges. Fill tomatoes with tuna salad.\nDip banana slices in lemon juice. Thread a toothpick through a banana slice, pineapple chunk, and strawberry. Repeat assembling kebabs with the remaining fruit.\nCut 1 carrot and 1 cucumber into 3/4-inch circles. Cut each carrot slice into the shape of a tulip using a small knife. Trim cucumber slices into leaves. Thread a leaf through a toothpick; insert a tulip on top. Repeat with the remaining leaves and tulips.\nCut the other carrot and cucumber into 1/2-inch slices. Cut out mini carrot and cucumber flowers using a mini flower-shaped vegetable cutter.\nPlace the hot egg in a heart-shaped egg mold; close the lid slowly and tightly. Soak the mold in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes. Remove egg and drain on a paper towel.\nArrange tuna-egg salad, fruit kebabs, tulips, carrot and cucumber cut-outs, and heart-shaped eggs in a bento box.",
