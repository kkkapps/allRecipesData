    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSlice open the dates, and stuff each with about 1/2 teaspoon goat cheese. Top each date with a pecan, using the goat cheese to hold the pecans in place. Wrap each date with 1/2 slice bacon.\nArrange the wrapped dates on a baking sheet. Bake 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bacon is crisp and evenly brown.\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, mix the balsamic vinegar and sugar until thickened. Pour over the dates to serve.",
