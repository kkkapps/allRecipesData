    "des": "\"Be warned that this recipe is for pumpkin lovers only! I use my homemade pumpkin puree that I make each autumn and freeze in 2-cup increments, but canned solid-pack pumpkin should work just fine. If you find the pumpkin flavor too intense, try adding a frozen banana. You can play around with the flavors easily by adding some vanilla extract or pumpkin or apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon. My 5-year old and 1-year old love it as the recipe is written. Another option is to not freeze the pumpkin and heat everything through to a simmer for a hot drink.\"",
    "ins": "Place the pumpkin puree in a freezer bag; store in freezer for at least 24 hours.\nHeat the bag of pumpkin puree in the microwave on HIGH to soften, 1 to 2 minutes.\nPour the milk into a blender. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, and pumpkin; blend until smooth.",
