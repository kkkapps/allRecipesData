    "des": "\"The recipe lists chicken thighs, but you can use any bone-in chicken pieces you like. You have got to taste this dish to believe it! It's my personal favorite, and I don't even like chicken! I know it doesn't sound too great, but you owe it to yourself to taste this tangy-sweet pineapple-chicken dish. Serve over cooked white rice if desired. (Note: You can vary the amount of chicken to taste. The less you use, the stronger the flavor).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nArrange chicken pieces in a single layer in a well greased 9x13 inch baking dish. In a small bowl mix together the ginger, paprika, onion powder and garlic salt. Add the vinegar and mix well. Divide this mixture. Brush 1/2 over the chicken pieces and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.\nTurn the chicken pieces, baste with the remaining 1/2 of the vinegar mixture and bake for 15 minutes longer. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the ketchup, soy sauce, pineapple and brown sugar. When chicken baking time is up, spoon the pineapple/soy mixture over the chicken. Bake for another 30 minutes. Serve while still hot.",
