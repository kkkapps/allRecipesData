    "des": "\"In southern Maryland we eat a lot of crab. This is an interesting way to use any leftover crab meat (we pick our own). I don't remember where I got this recipe. You can also use a good quality canned pasteurized crab meat. Either way, this recipe will wow your guests.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-1/2 quart baking dish.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and cook about 5 minutes (reduce heat if mixture begins to brown). Slowly whisk in the hot milk and heat until mixture reaches a low boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and allow to cool at least 5 minutes (otherwise eggs will cook when added to the mixture).\nStir the beaten egg yolks into the cooled sauce. Blend in the mayonnaise. Add the crabmeat and season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and Old Bay(R) seasoning if using. Gently fold in the beaten egg whites. Pour into prepared baking dish. Dust with paprika.\nBake until browned and puffy, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.",
