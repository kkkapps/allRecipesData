    "des": "\"A hearty vegetarian breakfast or brunch casserole. I made it up in a pinch during a brunch party, and it was the only dish that was finished! I like to use a dense buttermilk bread for this recipe, and a thick blue cheese dressing.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salad dressing and melted butter. Season with salt, pepper, garlic, thyme and savory.\nPlace enough slices of bread into the prepared baking dish to cover the bottom. Spread the thawed broccoli over the bread. Pour half of the egg mixture over. Make another layer of bread slices, and pour the remaining egg mixture over. Cover with shredded Cheddar cheese.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the strata is golden brown and puffy. Let stand for a few minutes before cutting into squares to serve.",
