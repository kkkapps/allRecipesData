    "des": "\"We make this for Halloween every year at my son's request! It's like spaghetti using bow-tie pasta! It is mixed together with mozzarella cheese cubes and baked in the oven. The bow-tie pasta is the bats and the stringy, gooey mozzarella cheese is the cobwebs!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water, bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Boil pasta, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well.\nCook and stir ground beef and onion in a large skillet until beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Stir in pasta sauce and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to simmer.\nStir cooked pasta and half of the mozzarella cheese into the sauce; toss to combine.  Transfer to a 2-quart baking dish. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until lightly browned and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.",
