    "des": "\"'This cheesy chicken casserole gets its vibrant color from frozen vegetables and its unique flavor from crumbled bacon,' reports Debbie Vannette of Zeeland, Michigan. 'The biscuit-topped dish has become a regular at our dinner table since my sister-in-law shared it with us after the birth of our son.'\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine the vegetables, chicken, soup, milk, 1 cup cheese and bacon if desired. Pour into an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 400 for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in another bowl, combine biscuit mix and milk. Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto chicken mixture. Bake, uncovered, for 20-22 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Top with onions and remaining cheese. Bake 3-4 minutes longer or until the cheese is melted.",
