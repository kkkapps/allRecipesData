    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nStir the 2 tablespoons of rosemary, garlic powder, and onion salt together in a bowl. Add the softened butter to the herb mixture; mix to combine. Spread the butter mixture evenly onto the cut sides of the bread loaf; top with the blue cheese slices. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet.\nPlace the bread under the broiler until the cheese is slightly melted, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle with additional rosemary if desired.",
