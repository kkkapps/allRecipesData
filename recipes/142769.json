    "ins": "Stir together the hot sauce, brown sugar, butter, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3 to 4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well blended. Remove from heat, and set aside.\nCoat a casserole dish with olive oil. Poke holes in the salmon with a fork, then place into the dish. Pour reserved sauce over the fish, top with green onions, and season with salt and pepper. Marinate for 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).\nBake salmon in preheated oven, uncovered, until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.",
