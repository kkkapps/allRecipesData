    "des": "\"The flavors of the broccoli and sweet potatoes compliment each other wonderfully in this recipe! I wasn't sure if steaming the sweet potatoes was necessary or not.  It might be okay to skip that step.  However, I wasn't sure if they would get tender enough by just cooking them in oil, so I went ahead and did it and it turned out great!\"",
    "ins": "Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place the diced sweet potatoes into a saucepan, and pour in 1/4-inch of water. Cover, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Steam until the sweet potatoes are just slightly tender, about 10 minutes. While the potatoes are steaming, heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion and broccoli until the onion is tender, about 10 minutes.\nOnce the potatoes have finished steaming, add them to the broccoli mixture, and season with garlic powder. Continue cooking until the potatoes have cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes. Stir the broccoli mixture together with the cooked quinoa and almonds. Season to taste with soy sauce if desired to serve.",
