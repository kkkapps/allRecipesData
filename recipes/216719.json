    "des": "\"A quick, budget-friendly soup that is great for using up extra vegetables in your cabinet or fridge. Serving this with crusty bread makes a great warming meal in wintertime. Add beef or chicken in with the vegetables for a heartier meal option.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion, potatoes, celery, and garlic in the melted butter until the onion and celery are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour the water over the vegetable mixture; stir the chicken bouillon into the liquid until dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil; cook at a boil until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 5 minutes.\nStir the cabbage into the boiling liquid. Reduce heat to medium. Add the tomatoes with juices, ketchup, hot sauce, and Italian seasoning; stir to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer until the flavors have a chance to mix, about 15 minutes.",
