    "ins": "Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.\nPour olive oil into a shallow bowl.\nRinse scallops under cold water, then dip into the olive oil.\nPress scallops into bread crumb mixture. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded scallops onto a plate while breading the rest.\nPlace the scallops in the refrigerator to allow the breading to set, 20 to 30 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nBrush the scallops lightly with more olive oil.\nGrill on the preheated grill until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes.",
