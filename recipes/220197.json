    "des": "\"A quick, easy, and flavorful fresh pasta dish that showcases the summer's garden bounty! This recipe came about in an effort to use up a few more of those wonderful home-grown tomatoes and fresh basil. Everything was on hand and was easy to throw together. For garlic lovers, the second time I made this dish I used a garlic-infused olive oil; amazing! A crisp green salad is the perfect accompaniment. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook angel hair pasta at a boil until tender but still slightly firm, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water for later use. Transfer the drained pasta to a large serving bowl.\nPlace tomatoes in a bowl; season with sea salt and black pepper.\nPour 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil over the tomato mixture and gently toss; set aside.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat.\nCook and stir sliced shallot in the hot oil until just becoming translucent, 1 to 2 minutes.\nStir garlic into the shallot; continue cooking and stirring 1 minute more. Remove the skillet from heat.\nAssemble the dish by adding the tomato mixture, the shallot and garlic mixture, and the prosciutto to the pasta; toss to combine. Use the reserved water from cooking the pasta to make it easier to mix.\nTop the pasta dish with basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese to serve.",
