    "des": "\"This tortilla sundae is served with a mango-strawberry-apple 'salsa.' The base is a corn tortilla fried in oil and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. The sweet tortilla shells can be fried the day before serving, as long as they are wrapped in foil or stored in a tin. Keeping color in mind, you can substitute other fruits in the salsa.\"",
    "ins": "In a 10-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat to 370 degrees or until a tortilla strip dropped in sizzles vigorously. Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside. Using tongs, slide one tortilla into the oil. Fry, turning once, until it stops sizzling and turns golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove and set on paper towels lining a large wire rack set over a shallow pan. Sprinkle liberally with cinnamon sugar. Repeat with one tortilla at a time, then the tortilla strips. (Can be stored in foil or a large tin overnight.)\nUp to 4 hours ahead, mix next 7 ingredients for salsa; refrigerate until ready to serve.\nPut 3 small scoops of sorbet or ice cream on each tortilla. Top with fruit, garnish with tortilla strips and serve immediately.",
