    "ins": "Beat the eggs and milk together in a small bowl; set aside. Stir the bread crumbs, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip the chicken breasts into the egg mixture and press into the bread crumbs, shaking off the excess bread crumbs. Cook the chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nRemove the chicken breasts from the pan, set aside, and keep warm. Pour the white wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Increase temperature to medium-high and stir in the flour. Cook and stir until the wine has reduced to half its original volume, about 1 minute. Whisk in the cream and garlic and bring to a simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper; cook and stir until thickened, about 8 minutes. Stir in the prosciutto, spinach, and mozzarella cheese; cook and stir until the cheese has melted and the spinach has wilted. Pour the sauce over the chicken breasts to serve.",
