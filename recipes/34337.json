    "des": "\"This recipe makes a very rich peach cobbler.  The crust is very sweet and cookie-like.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.  Definitely not for those watching their weight!\"",

Scatter the butter over the peaches, then sprinkle the brown sugar evenly on top. Set aside. Mix flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir the oil into the beaten eggs, then stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients. Spoon the batter over the peaches, then sprinkle cinnamon on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until the crust is lightly browned, about 45 minutes.",
