    "ins": "Place the milk, egg, salt, sugar, butter, flour, and yeast into a bread machine in that order. Start the machine's Dough cycle.\nOnce the dough cycle has completed, remove the dough from the bread machine to a lightly floured surface. Cover with a large mixing bowl, and let rest 10 to 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 10 balls, then flatten, and gently stretch into 8x6-inch ovals (a beaver tail shape.)\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCook the dough one or two at a time in the hot oil until lightly browned on each side, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar to serve.",
