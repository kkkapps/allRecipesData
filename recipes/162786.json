    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish, and set aside.\nTear the doughnuts into bite-size pieces, and place them in a large bowl. Pour in the sweetened condensed milk, eggs, peaches with juice, cinnamon, and salt, and mix. Spoon the mixture into the greased baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.\nWhile the cobbler is baking, make a glaze by combining the melted butter, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Stir until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the baked cobbler.",
