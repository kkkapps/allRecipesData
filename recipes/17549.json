Mix until smooth and well blended, then fold in the white chocolate chips. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until cake springs back to the touch. Allow cake to cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. When cake is cool, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.",
