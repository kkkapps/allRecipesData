    "des": "\"I love this homemade sangria that my Grandfather taught me to make when I was young wife. He told me he had learn to make when he was working down in Mexico in his younger days. It is easy but it does takes time to cure between steps. We have had mango sangria, peach-mango sangria, or pear-pineapple sangria. You can garnish with blueberries, mint leaves, or fresh peach slices if you would like.\"",
