Feel free to season this with whatever you use for either chili or scrambled eggs, Tabasco\u00c2\u00ae, salsa, green chili, or what-not. This goes great with tortillas and cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs until no longer moist, about 3 minutes. Pour chili into the skillet; stir. Continue cooking until the chili is hot, about 5 minutes.",
