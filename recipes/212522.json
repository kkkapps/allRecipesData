    "ins": "Heat the oil in a shallow skillet over medium heat; fry the chana dal in the hot oil for about 5 minutes. Stir the red chile peppers, garlic, curry leaves, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds into the dal and continue cooking until the spices are roasted and fragrant, about 3 minutes more. Spread the mixture onto some newspaper to cool to room temperature; grind into a find powder. Season with salt. The powder will keep in an airtight container on the shelf for a few months.",
