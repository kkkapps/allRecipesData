    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRub olive oil generously over all sides of prime rib roast. Grind rosemary with coffee beans in a spice grinder and sprinkle the mixture over the roast. Sprinkle lemon pepper and black pepper over the meat, followed by garlic powder and onion powder. Place roast into a large roasting pan and cover with non-stick aluminum foil.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Uncover and continue roasting until meat is browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast reads at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 more minutes. Let roast rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.",
