    "des": "\"In my efforts to use the abundance of zucchini in my garden I concocted this little cookie.  I prefer my oatmeal cookies to have a little jazz, so if you are not a fan of ground cloves, they can be omitted.  It's a not too sweet cake-like cookie that is perfect with your cup of coffee or tea.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.\nStir together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl; set aside. Beat the butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add the egg and the vanilla extract.  Mix in the flour mixture and oats until just incorporated.\nWring the zucchini in a clean towel to remove any excess moisture. Stir the zucchini and raisins into the dough; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls 2-inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 14 to 16 minutes or until the bottom edges turn golden brown.",
