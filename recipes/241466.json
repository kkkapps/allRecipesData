Spread potatoes into the bottom of a 13x8-inch cake pan; top with diced kielbasa and diced egg. Season mixture with pepper.\nStir sour cream and milk together in a bowl and pour over the ingredients in the cake pan. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over sour cream layer.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the casserole is hot in the middle, about 30 minutes.",
