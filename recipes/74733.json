    "ins": "Combine the rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until rice is tender. Drain, if necessary, and cool.\nWhile the rice is cooling, place golden raisins in a bowl, and fill with enough hot water to cover. Let soak for 20 minutes to plump. Drain.\nIn a medium bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form. Fold in curry powder, lemon juice, salt and pepper. In a separate bowl, stir together the brown rice, asparagus, red pepper, apples, and raisins. Fold into the curry cream, and chill until serving.",
