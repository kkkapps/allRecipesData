    "des": "\"A very simple yet delicious way to wrap freshly cooked white asparagus in ham slices. You need as many ham slices as asparagus spears. This dish is traditionally served with new potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Peel asparagus spears from top to bottom with a vegetable peeler, starting below the tips. Cut off woody ends with a knife.\nPlace asparagus spears in a large, wide saucepan and pour in enough lightly salted water to just cover. Bring water to a boil; add 1 tablespoon butter and sugar. Reduce heat; simmer until spears are tender and easily pierced with a knife, 15 to 25 minutes. Drain well.\nMelt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a small pot over low heat.\nWrap each asparagus spear with a slice of ham. Arrange on a serving plate; drizzle melted butter on top.",
