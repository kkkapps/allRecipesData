    "des": "\"Chicken breasts boiled gently, then seasoned and simmered with a yogurt curry sauce. Creamy taste without a creamy waist! This chicken will be very moist and tender. Can be served over brown rice with a green salad or with avocado slices, pear slices and crumbled feta cheese on top.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken and water in a medium saucepan and simmer over medium low heat for about 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.\nWhen water is almost reduced, season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. In a small bowl, combine yogurt and curry powder and mix together. Stir this mixture into saucepan until all chicken pieces are coated, then simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through and marinate.",
