    "des": "\"Tasty high-protein, low-carb breakfast idea. Easy to make and I like making my own sausage because I know what's in it! These will keep and re-heat well. Make them on Sunday and eat them as a quick 'grab-and-go' during the week.\"",
    "ins": "Stir salt, sage, black pepper, turmeric, and marjoram together in a bowl. Place pork in a separate bowl. Sprinkle salt mixture evenly over pork and stir to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter eight 8-ounce ramekins.\nDivide sausage mixture into 8 balls. Press each ball into a ramekin, creating a well in the center of each. Crack an egg into each sausage well.\nBake in the preheated oven until sausage is cooked through and eggs are set, 30 to 40 minutes.",
