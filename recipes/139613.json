Add artichokes, and toss until coated with oil. Pour in saffron water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the artichokes are tender, about 8 minutes.\nUncover the artichokes and increase heat to medium-high. Add the figs, almonds, vinegar, and paprika. Cook and stir until all of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat, recover, and allow to stand for 5 minutes before serving.",
