Pour marinade over tenderloins, seal, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.\nPrepare the grill for indirect heat.\nLightly oil grill grate. Remove meat from marinade, and discard liquid. Grill for 15 to 25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
