    "des": "\"A sweet but spicy BBQ Sauce. Just thick enough to slab on any meat over the grill or in the oven. The whole family enjoyed the stickiness and flavor. Brush sauce onto meat of your choice. Sweet, but a touch of hotness, too. I found this to be very enjoyable on ribs. Was able to do a 8-rib rack, but it can do another one; I just like it thick. This would be enough for 12 chicken quarters. Very easy.\"",
