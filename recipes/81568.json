    "ins": "In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, mint, and garlic.  Refrigerate.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef and onions until meat is browned, stirring occasionally to crumble; drain fat. Stir in 1 cup water, carrot, salt, black pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin; simmer uncovered for 30 minutes or until water evaporates.\nLay out wonton wrappers on aluminum foil.  Mound two large spoonfuls of beef mixture in the center of one wrapper.  Dip a finger in water and trace it around all four edges.  Lay a second wonton wrapper on top of the first, and press on all edges to seal. Roll up the edges to create a round, hat-shaped ravioli. Repeat, making 13 ravioli.\nPlace ravioli in steamer and steam 40 minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix together the yellow split peas, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon coriander, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, chicken bouillon, and 1 1/2 cups of water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes, or until it reaches a thick slurry-like consistency.\nMeanwhile, in the large skillet, mix remaining beef mixture with 2 tablespoons water, tomato paste, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Simmer over low heat until liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.\nTo serve, spread yogurt on a serving plate.  Top with ravioli, and top again with split pea mixture. Finally, top with tomato and beef mixture.  Serve immediately.",
