Remove from heat and add bread mixture to sour cream mixture; stir.\nStuff each bread crust with sour cream-spinach mixture and place loaves crust-side down on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and tops begin to brown, about 30 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before slicing.",
