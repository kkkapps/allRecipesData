    "des": "\"Very easy recipe to make, and a wonderful twist to an ordinary perogy.  These cheese filled perogies taste great just boiled or fried with a little butter.  Eat them with sour cream and you will have a wonderful dinner. You can easily double or triple the recipe and place extras in the freezer.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix together the cottage cheese, egg yolks, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Set aside.\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and baking powder. Pour in the vegetable oil and cold water, and mix or knead into a smooth dough.\nRoll dough out on a lightly floured surface, and cut into 3 inch circles using a glass, can, or cookie cutter. Place a spoonful of the cottage cheese filling onto each circle. Fold in half, and pinch the edges together to seal.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the perogies into the water, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they float. Remove from water with a slotted spoon, and place on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet to drain excess water.",
