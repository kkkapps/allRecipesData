Pour 1/2 of the batter into the bundt pan.\nMeasure 1/2 of the remaining batter into a small bowl and stir in the strawberry extract and food color (as much as you want to make a pretty, dark pink color). Carefully pour this into the pan.\nStir 1/4 cup chocolate syrup into the remaining batter and carefully pour this into the pan on top of the strawberry batter.\nBake for about 40 minutes in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven. Cool 15 minutes.\nRemove from pan and drizzle chocolate glaze over the top.\nTo make chocolate glaze: Mix together confectioners' sugar and 3 tablespoons chocolate syrup until smooth. If necessary, a few drops of water or a small amount of additional confectioners' sugar may be added until the desired consistency is obtained. Drizzle over top of the bundt cake.",
