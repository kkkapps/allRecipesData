    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a medium saucepan lightly salted water to a boil; add chicken breasts and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and gently simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 15 minutes. Drain.\nLet chicken cool until it can be easily handled. Shred chicken with your hands; return to empty sauce pan. Stir barbeque sauce, parsley, and garlic into chicken.\nLay 4 tortillas on a baking sheet. Evening spread chicken mixture among the 4 tortillas, leaving a 1-inch border around the outer edge. Top each tortilla with 1/4 tomatoes and 1/4 Cheddar cheese. Place another tortilla atop each filled tortilla.\nBake quesadillas in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve.",
