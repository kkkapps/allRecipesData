    "des": "\"Perfect for a summer afternoon BBQ. Sliced jarred mango in the produce section works fine in this recipe as fresh mango can sometimes be hard to find and are hard to handle. All measurements are to taste and can be adjusted per individual preference.\"",
    "ins": "Stir the shrimp, mango, and green onion together in a bowl; set aside.\nWhisk the lime juice, honey, and cayenne pepper together in a separate bowl until blended, making sure to scrape along bottom of bowl as needed to incorporate honey; pour over the shrimp mixture.

Top each bread slice with a slice of Brie cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until slightly browned and the Brie cheese is soft and melted, about 5 minutes. Top each slice with 1 tablespoon of the shrimp mixture to serve.",
