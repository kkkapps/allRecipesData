    "des": "\"Since my stepmother is allergic to tomatoes, I needed a good barbeque sauce that has no tomato. So here I am depending on the rhubarb to give me that tang. Makes a unique sauce. Add the liquid smoke flavoring if you aren't grilling with real smoke.\"",
    "ins": "Combine rhubarb, soda, apple cider vinegar, sweet onion, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, cinnamon, allspice, salt, black pepper, cloves, ground chipotle, garlic powder, and liquid smoke in a saucepan; bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until rhubarb and onion are very soft, about 45 minutes, stirring often.\nPour the sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and pulse a few times to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches if necessary until sauce is smooth.",
