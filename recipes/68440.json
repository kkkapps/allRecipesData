    "des": "\"This recipe is something I will whip together on nights when spaghetti just won't cut it, but time is a commodity worth more than gold. There are only two in my family, but that just means plenty of yummy leftovers. Serve this chili with cheese on top and a thick slice of homemade sourdough bread and you've got a winner. The measurements are approximations since I'm more of a shake and dab type of cook, but this is generally right. This gives more kick than you might think, so be lenient with the pepper flakes if you are serving kids!\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground beef, and cook until evenly browned. Stir occasionally to crumble. Season the beef with chili powder, onion flakes, cumin, paprika, garlic and red pepper flakes, and mix well.\nPour in the tomatoes, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for at least 30 minutes, or longer for thicker chili. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
