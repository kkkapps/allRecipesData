    "ins": "Proof yeast in warm water.\nPlace the butter or margarine and buttermilk in a small saucepan.  Heat slowly until butter or margarine has melted.  Cool to lukewarm.\nPlace sugar, salt, baking soda, buttermilk mixture, and yeast in large mixing bowl.  Add 3 cups flour one cup at a time, and mix with the dough hook attachment of an electric mixer.  Gradually add the remaining flour while continuing to mix.   When dough is not sticky, turn out on a lightly floured surface.  Knead for several minutes, until the dough is soft and smooth. Place in a greased bowl, and turn once.  Allow to rise until doubled in size.\nPunch down the dough.  Divide, and shape into 2 loaves.  Place in two well greased  8 x 4 inch bread pans.  Allow to rise until dough has risen one inch above pans.\nBake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 30 to 35 minutes.  Loaves are done when nicely brown and hollow sounding when thumped.",
