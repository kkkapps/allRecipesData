    "des": "\"This recipe is the culmination of much experimentation in my kitchen. I have omitted black tea, as I am not fond of caffeine. The resulting tea follows in the tradition sprung up on the west coast, particularly the SF bay area, where a fondness for strong spices seems to be most favored, savored and brewed. Add enough soy milk or cows milk to suit your taste.\"",
