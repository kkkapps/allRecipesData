    "des": "\"Annam parvanam is probably the most common Naivedyam item in South India. I like to add some more flavor and richness to this traditional parvanam by adding some fresh coconut to it. You can use sugar instead of jaggery, but I like using a bit of both. Feel free to experiment with this dessert. I like to serve this cold.\"",
    "ins": "Place the rice in a bowl and cover with a few inches of cold water; let soak for 1 hour. Drain in a sieve.\nBring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan; stir the rice, coconut, white sugar, jaggery, and cardamom into the milk. Reduce heat to low and cook until the rice is tender and the mixture is thick and creamy, 30 to 45 minutes.\nHeat the ghee in a small skillet over medium heat. Fry the cashews and raisins in the ghee until the cashews are lightly browned and the raisins plump; stir the mixture into the rice. Eat right away, or better, chill in the refrigerator for a few hours and serve. If the kheer gets too thick, thin it out with some milk.",
