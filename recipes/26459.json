    "des": "\"This is a quick and interesting recipe to prepare posole for unexpected guests or to take to a potluck party.  My husband loves it.  I have played around with this recipe A LOT.  You can use 1 (10 ounce) package of frozen corn instead of hominy, or delete the chilies or olives.  I prepare mine depending on whether children are going to eat it or not.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over medium heat, combine oil, onion, garlic, oregano and cumin.  Cook, covered, 5 minutes, until onions are tender.\nStir in broth, hominy, chile peppers and olives.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium.  Stir chicken into pot.  Cover and cook until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes.",
