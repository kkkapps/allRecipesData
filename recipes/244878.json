    "des": "\"This recipe was shared with me by a health-conscious African missionary who uses these wraps as a substitute for pasta/bread in his meals. There are the most healthy, delicious wraps you will ever taste! Use as tortillas or as a pasta/bread substitute in any meal. Fill with stew, meat, taco fillings, whatever is for dinner/lunch that would normally be served over/with pasta or bread.\"",
    "ins": "Place cauliflower in a pot and cover halfway with water; bring to a boil and cook until completely mushy, 15 to 20 minutes. Mash cauliflower with a hand blender or potato masher until the consistency of mashed potatoes.\nMix eggs, psyllium husks, and salt into mashed cauliflower until smooth and fully incorporated. Let mixture sit for 20 minutes.\nSeparate mixture into balls smaller than tennis balls and larger than golf balls. The dough will be sticky. Roll each ball on a work surface coated in coconut flour until wraps are thin.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat. Place wraps in the hot skillet and cook until crisp and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Cool wraps on a wire rack.",
