    "ins": "Grease a 9x13 inch pan.\nIn a medium saucepan combine sugar, cream and butter.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.\nStir in marshmallow creme and white chocolate chips; mix well.  Reserve 2 separate 1/2 cups of mixture and set aside.\nTo one of the reserved 1/2 cups mixture add red food coloring until desired shade of red is achieved.  To the other 1/2 cup of mixture add green food coloring until desired shade of green is achieved.\nPour white mixture into prepared pan.  Pour dots of both the red and green mixtures across the top.  Using a toothpick or knife, swirl colors throughout the white.\nChill for 2 hours and cut into 2 inch squares.",
