    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nHeat the butter and garlic in a skillet over medium heat until the butter begins to bubble. Stir in the shrimp, and cook until they just turn pink, about 3 minutes. Place one shrimp into each mushroom cap, and place into a small baking dish. Spoon the garlic butter into the mushroom caps, and sprinkle each with a pinch of mozzarella cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the mushrooms are tender and the cheese is golden and bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes.",
