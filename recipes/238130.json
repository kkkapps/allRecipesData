    "des": "\"Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully. We are talking about bacon, cheese, and onions after all, so it wasn't that big of a shock. The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk well rewarded.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; remove from heat. Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings.\nWhisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Add drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar to flour mixture; whisk until batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.\nCombine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; whisk until chile powder is completely dissolved.\nHeat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes to plate and top with maple syrup.",
