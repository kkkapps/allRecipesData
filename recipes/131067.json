    "des": "\"I've experimented with these a lot and have finally found a combination that comes out as stiff as gelatin desserts but are completely vegan.  Works well as a substitute for gelatin in other recipes or just as treats on it's own. Half of a cup of chilled juice can be replaced with your favorite liquor to make a cocktail.\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve the cornstarch in the water in a small cup or bowl and set aside. In a saucepan, combine 1 1/2  cups of cherry juice and agar-agar powder. Let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Set heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 1 minute.\nRemove from the heat and stir in the remaining juice along with the cornstarch mixture until no longer cloudy. Pour into small serving cups and refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.",
