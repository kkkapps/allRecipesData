    "des": "\"This is a simple sweet and sour sauce with nice depth of flavor. You can use it for marinating chicken and pork or for a dipping sauce. Goes great with meatballs for something a little different. For a zesty kick, add some bottled hot pepper sauce.\"",

Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Return mixture to saucepan and bring to a simmer.\nWhisk cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water together in a bowl until smooth; stir into the sauce. Increase heat to medium. Cook and stir sauce until thick, 2 to 3 minutes.",
