    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the top and bottom of a broiler pan with cooking spray.\nLayer sweet potatoes, potatoes, and onion slices in the bottom of the broiler pan.\nPlace chicken, breast side down, on a work surface. Cut along both sides of the backbone with kitchen shears from top to bottom; remove backbone. Flip chicken and splay it open. Press firmly onto breasts with your hands to break the breast-bone.\nBrush olive oil over chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Place on the broiler pan top.\nRoast in the preheated oven until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.\nLet cool before slicing, about 10 minutes. Serve with potato and onion mixture.",
