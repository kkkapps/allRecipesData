    "ins": "Carefully cut lobster tails down the center using scissors, making a wide enough incision for the meat to \"flower\" out during cooking. De-vein the meat, if desired.\nCombine wine, cherry tomatoes, butter, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and salt in a large pot; add lobster tails. Bring heat to medium and steam lobster tails for 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon garlic powder and continue steaming until meat is cooked through and tender, about 3 minutes more.",
