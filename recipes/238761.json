    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper.\nBeat the butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition just until combined. Beat in the vanilla. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour and the pecans. Cover and chill about 1 hour or until the dough is easy to handle.\nCombine 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl.\nShape dough into 1 1/2-inch balls. Roll the balls in the sugar mixture to coat. Arrange 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten the dough balls slightly.\nBake 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are firm and bottoms are very light brown. Let cool on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes. Slide the parchment paper with baked cookies on it to wire racks and let cool completely. Once cooled, slide the parchment paper onto a work surface.\nSpread Cinnamon Buttercream Frosting onto the flat side of half of the cookies. Top with remaining cookies, flat-sides down.\nCinnamon Buttercream Frosting: Beat butter with an electric mixer on medium speed in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Add 2 cups powdered sugar, beating well. Beat in 1/4 cup milk, cinnamon, and vanilla. Gradually beat in 6 cups more powdered sugar.
