We love to tailgate and watch the Bowl games, and are always trying to come up with clever things to do to our biggest rivals up north, the Michigan Wolverines. The cherries and maple in this wonderful salad inspired the name. Enjoy!\"",

Set aside.\nIn a large serving bowl, combine the lettuce, cherries, apples, goat cheese and candied pecans.
