    "des": "\"This is a delicious recipe reminiscent of the peppermint bark made at Christmastime that uses a favorite Easter treat. Fun and easy to make too! Everyone really enjoys the combination of creamy white chocolate and fruity jellybeans. Use your favorite, but I always go for the small pectin variety. Hope you enjoy!\"",
