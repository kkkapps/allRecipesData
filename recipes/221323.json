Celery and carrot may still be crisp; season with salt. Add ground pork and garlic. Continue to cook and stir until pork is no longer pink. Season with more salt. Drain any excess grease and stir in red pepper flakes, garlic powder, turmeric, ginger, cumin, coriander, and celery seed. Set aside to cool.\nPlace about 1 tablespoon pork mixture on a lumpia wrapper with one corner facing you. Fold corner closest to you over filling; fold two side corners toward center and continue rolling wrapper around pork. Brush a small amount of water over the top corner and press to seal.
