    "des": "\"This recipe is a great spin-off on your conventional (and let's face it, plain) side dish of rice at dinner. The brown rice provides a nutritious, fiber-packed alternative to white rice, and the cilantro and the lime gives this dish an extra dash of delicious Mexican flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 30 to 45 minutes.\nTransfer brown rice to a large bowl and cool slightly, 5 to 7 minutes.\nWhisk lime juice, garlic, olive oil, and salt together in a bowl; stir into rice. Fold cilantro into rice mixture.",
