    "des": "\"This flavorful barbeque sauce for ribs is just like the kind they serve at a famous restaurant in Montreal, Quebec that has people lining up on the street any given night of the week. Try this -- you'll luv it!  Don't' skip the lemon juice or cinnamon.  Simmer the left over sauce until sugar is completely dissolved and serve as extra sauce for those who like their ribs dripping with flavor.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix applesauce, ketchup, packed brown sugar, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic salt and ground cinnamon. Use the mixture to marinate ribs in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before preparing as desired. Also use for basting the ribs while cooking.",
