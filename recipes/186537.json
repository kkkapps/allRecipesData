    "des": "\"Inspired by a recipe I saw on television, I experimented with different combinations and came up with this.  This is a delicious and unusual variation on plain old French Toast.  Try it, I guarantee you'll love it!  Thanks to the Blue Moon Cafe in Baltimore for the inspiration. Not for the diet conscious, but it tastes so good you won't care! Put bread in a warm oven to keep heated until the rest of the bread is done, if needed. Serve with a dollop of butter and warmed pure maple syrup, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Beat the eggs and sugar in a bowl until smooth. Pour in the cream, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg; whisk until smooth. Pour the crushed cereal into a shallow dish; set aside. Dip the egg bread into the egg mixture two pieces at a time until the egg has been soaked into the center of the slices, about 30 seconds per side. Press the soaked bread into the crushed cereal until coated on both sides. Set the finished slices aside on a piece of waxed paper.\nMelt the butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the French toast in the hot pan until golden on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.",
