    "des": "\"This pudding turns out in a lovely custard texture. A great balm for those seeking a return to some of the old-fashioned foods of their youth! We like it best because it is oven-baked and not made on the stove top.\"",

Stir in white sugar, uncooked rice, butter, vanilla extract, raisins, and nutmeg. Pour into prepared pan.\nBake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Stir frequently during the first hour.",
