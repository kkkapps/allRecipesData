    "ins": "Combine the shrimp stock, lemon zest and lime zest in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and shrimp and cook until shrimp have heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the fish sauce, lime juice, green onion, cilantro and chile pepper. Taste and adjust salt and pepper if needed. Soup should be sour, salty, spicy and hot.",
