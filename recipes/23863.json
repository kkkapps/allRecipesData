Freshly cooked beans are better than the canned variety so have some on hand always, all beans work well for this wonderful soup! Ladle into your nicest soup plate, find a warm cozy place to sit and sip your soup.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan, place the cannellini beans, garlic, sausage, onion and kale with just enough water to cover. Season with 2 teaspoons of parsley, thyme and salt and pepper if desired. Bring to a boil and cook until vegetables are tender. Serve immediately garnished with Parmesan cheese and remaining fresh parsley.",
