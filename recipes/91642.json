    "ins": "Soak corn in cold water for 1 to 3 hours.\nStir together macadamia nut oil and melted butter in a bowl. Season with garlic, rosemary, sage, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper; stir in Parmesan cheese.\nDrain corn and pat dry. Spread butter mixture evenly over each ear of corn, and place each piece on a square of aluminum foil.  Tightly wrap each ear and puncture to allow excess steam to escape while grilling.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.\nGrill the corn cobs until tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, turning frequently.  Remove from the grill and check for doneness; if the corn is not done, continue cooking an additional 5 minutes.",
