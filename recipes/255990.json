    "des": "\"My husband came up with this unique combination and the family fell in love. We use this as a filling for burritos. You can pre-make and freeze the burritos for an easy and instant meal. To make a breakfast-style burrito, substitute scrambled eggs for 1/2 of the ground beef or pork. Serve with warm flour tortillas.\"",
