Repeat until bottom is covered, alternating the whole and half sandwiches. Spread with half of the whipped topping. Pour caramel on top. Sprinkle with half of the peanuts. Repeat layers with remaining ice cream sandwiches, whipped topping, and peanuts. The pan will be full. Cover and freeze for up to 2 months. Remove from freezer 20 minutes before serving.
