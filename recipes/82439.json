    "des": "\"A very easy, spicy stir fry!  Adjust spice to your particular taste! Best with marinade, but in a pinch, it's not necessary! Can be chicken, beef whatever meat or cut of meat you have on hand! Enjoy with basmati or sticky rice.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together rice wine vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Stir in pork pieces, cover, and leave at room temperature for 1/2 hour.\nHeat a large wok over medium heat. Toast almonds in hot, dry wok until golden brown and fragrant.\nHeat vegetable oil in wok over medium-high heat. Stir in marinated pork pieces, ginger, and chile paste. (Discard remaining marinade.) Mix in teriyaki sauce, and increase heat to high; cook, stirring constantly, until pork is white. Stir in peppers, and continue to stir fry until most of the liquid has evaporated.
