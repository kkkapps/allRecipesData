Slowly pour in egg mixture; stir gently. Reduce heat to low and cover.\nPush mixture from the sides to the center with a spatula, allowing uncooked eggs from top of egg skillet to seep down to the bottom, then re-cover. Do this several times, every few minutes, until eggs are just about set.\nStir in 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese; add remaining cheese to top of egg skillet. Cover and allow cheese to melt. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.",
