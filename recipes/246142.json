    "des": "\"This sandwich gets a crunchy finish with chips embedded into the bread. I use very special potato chips that were sent to me from Pennsylvania by my dear friend, MP. But if you can't find Utz\u00c2\u00ae, your favorite chip will work just fine. Serve with more chips and pickles.\"",
    "ins": "Mix tuna, 1/4 cup mayonnaise, and Dijon mustard together in a small bowl. Stir in pickle and red onion. Spread tuna mixture on 2 slices of bread. Top each with 2 slices of Cheddar cheese.\nSpread 1 tablespoon cream cheese on each of the remaining 2 slices of bread. Place on top of the Cheddar cheese.\nPlace crushed chips in a shallow bowl. Spread top side of each tuna melt with 1 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise and press into the chips. Repeat on other side.\nHeat a dry grill pan over medium-high heat. Toast tuna melts until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.",
