    "des": "\"Tabbouleh-like composed salad fits in well at potlucks. This is the basic version. You may dress it up with a host of other goodies. Avocado and lime-marinated shrimp come to mind. Or grilled and chilled chicken breast. Of course if you do that it stops being a side dish and becomes a main course, but why not? The longer it's chilled the better.\"",

Drain immediately and plunge into a bowl of ice-cold water; drain.\nMix jicama, black beans, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap.
