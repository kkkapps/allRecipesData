Stir walnuts into dry ingredients.\nBeat eggs and brown sugar in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until thick and pale, about 3 minutes. Add sunflower seed oil, walnut oil, and yogurt; beat to combine. Stir in mashed bananas and vanilla extract.\nPour egg mixture over dry ingredients and mix briefly, until just moistened. Divide batter between loaf pans.\nBake loaves in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove pans from the oven and let sit 5 minutes, then remove loaves to cool on wire racks.",
