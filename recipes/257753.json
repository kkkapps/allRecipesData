    "des": "\"This is a fun and tasty, easy-to-make recipe. Mexican fajita shrimp are served with a surprisingly crunchy tostada base! Timing is important with this recipe. You want your fajita mixture to sizzle when you serve, so make sure to prepare all your fixings (lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers) before you cook the shrimp. Arrange fixings on a serving tray with shredded cheese and sour cream.\"",

Cover to keep beans hot.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add shrimp, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and onion. Stir in soy sauce, fajita seasoning, and lemon pepper. Cook and stir until shrimp is evenly coated and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\nBring shrimp mixture to the table in the hot skillet. Spread refried beans over tostada shells; pile shrimp mixture on top.",
