Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.\nPlace ice cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Blend on low speed until uniformly softened, 10 to 15 seconds. Add marshmallows; blend until incorporated.\nLine a rimmed 9x13-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread ice cream on top. Freeze until firm, 5 hours to overnight.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread 1 to 2 teaspoons frosting on the bottom of each cookie. Place 12 cookies frosting side-up on the baking sheet.\nRemove ice cream from the freezer. Cut ice cream into rounds using a 2-inch cookie cutter.

Press another cookie on top, frosting-side down.\nPlace baking sheet in the freezer until ice cream cookie sandwiches are firm, 8 hours to overnight.\nPour sprinkles into a bowl. Roll each ice cream sandwich in sprinkles. Place 1 sandwich into each sandwich bag; fold the edge and crease to seal. Freeze for 1 to 2 hours.\nPeel down bag as you eat, keeping the bag underneath to catch drips.",
