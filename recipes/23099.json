    "ins": "Over medium high heat in a large heavy kettle, combine the syrup and sugar, bring to a boil and continue to boil for one minute.  Reduce heat to low and stir in the margarine and peanut butter until melted. Add marshmallows and stir until well blended.\nPour the cereal into a large bowl, and stir in the marshmallow mixture so that the cereal is evenly coated. Grease an 11x17 inch jellyroll pan and press the cereal into the pan. Flatten with the back of a buttered spoon.\nTo make the frosting, melt the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips over a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring frequently until smooth. Spread evenly over the bars in the pan. Let stand until the bars are cool, and topping is set. Cut into squares and serve.",
