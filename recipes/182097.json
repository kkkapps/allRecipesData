    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nPeel and grate the sweet potatoes; place in a clean cloth and squeeze out the excess liquid; transfer to a large bowl.\nHeat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until soft; transfer to the bowl with the drained sweet potato; add about 2/3 of the goat cheese and the beaten eggs; mix well. Divide the mixture into 4 even portions and shape into balls with your hands and then flatten them to about 1/2 inch thickness. Arrange the patties onto a baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven until golden brown; about 25 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining goat cheese over the patties and return to oven to melt the cheese, about 5 minutes more.",
