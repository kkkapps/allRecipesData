    "des": "\"Greek yogurt with minted honey. Cold, smooth, and refreshing. Terrific for summer evenings. Garnish with mint sprigs, orange wheels, or strawberry slices.\n\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the yogurt and lemon juice until smooth in a freezer-safe metal bowl. Combine the honey and mint in a small bowl. Pour the honey on top of the yogurt, then give the yogurt a few quick stirs so that the honey forms \"ribbons\" in the yogurt but is not blended in completely. Cover bowl and freeze for 1 to 2 hours.",
