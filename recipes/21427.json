    "ins": "Heat deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace meat on a solid, level surface and pound with a mallet until it is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick.\nPlace the flour and bread crumbs in separate dishes. Soup plates are useful. Lightly beat the eggs and add the milk.  Lightly season with salt and pepper and put this into another soup plate.\nCoat the meat in flour, patting lightly by hand.  Using a fork to hold the meat, dip into the egg mixture and drain slightly.  Next, coat with the breadcrumbs by lightly pressing the crumbs into the meat.  When each piece of meat has been prepared, deep fry in cooking oil until golden brown.",
