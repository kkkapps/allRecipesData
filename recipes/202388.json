    "des": "\"These tasty meatballs are easy to make. Wonderful for your Chinese New Year celebration or as an addition to a holiday buffet. Some folks dye the glutinous rice with red or green for a holiday touch. Another serving idea is to whisk together 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and garlic to taste and sprinkle over the meatballs, rice, and some steamed vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Place the rice in a bowl with enough water to cover. Allow to soak 2 hours. Drain and pour onto a platter.\nMix the ground pork, water, wine, cornstarch, soy sauce, onion, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl until all ingredients are evenly mixed. Divide and roll the mixture into balls 1-1/2 to 2 inches in size. Roll the meatballs in the soaked glutinous rice to coat completely.\nLine a large bamboo steamer with the cabbage leaves. Arrange the meatballs atop the cabbage leaves.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat; place a bamboo steamer over the boiling water. Steam the meatballs until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.",
