    "des": "\"My favorite on-the-go breakfast or afternoon snack. Packed with lots of fiber, protein, and lower in sugar than most treats. Perfect with a nice cup of coffee or tea. Gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, and peanut-free. This recipe can also be made into banana muffins.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish or line with parchment paper.\nCombine coconut flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mash bananas in a separate bowl; whisk in eggs. Stir coconut sugar and vanilla extract into banana mixture; stir into coconut flour mixture using a wooden spoon, folding until batter is combined. Spoon batter into the baking dish; top with sunflower seeds and extra coconut sugar.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool bread in the refrigerator, about 20 minutes. Store in refrigerator.",
