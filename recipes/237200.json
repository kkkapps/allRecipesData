    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine crackers, garlic salt, and ranch dressing mix in a resealable plastic bag; squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Finely crush crackers with a rolling pin or heavy skillet. Pour 1/3 the crumbs mixture into a large bowl.\nPour flour into a bowl. Pour eggs into another bowl.\nGently press chicken pieces into flour to coat and shake off excess flour. Dip into beaten egg and press into cracker crumbs. Place the breaded chicken pieces onto a plate while breading the rest.\nWorking in batches, cook breaded chicken in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear, about 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
