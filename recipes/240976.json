    "des": "\"I love instant oatmeal 'raisins and spice' flavor, but I wanted better oats, so this is my own twist. \n\nThis recipe is not 'quick,' but if you make this large amount, you can refrigerate in small storage containers for a quick and easy snack or meal. This oatmeal taste great hot but even tastes good cold when you are on the go.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Stir oats into boiling water and cook at a boil until the mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Season oats mixture with salt; stir.\nReduce heat to low and simmer oats until beginning to soften, about 20 minutes.\nStir milk, brown sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl with a whisk until smooth; stir into the oats mixture. Continue cooking the oats until tender, 10 to 15 minutes more.\nStir cranberries into the oatmeal to distribute throughout the mixture; cook just until the berries are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.",
