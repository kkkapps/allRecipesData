Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until hot throughout and flavors blend, about 10 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Ladle pasta into bowls and spoon shrimp mixture over the top.",
