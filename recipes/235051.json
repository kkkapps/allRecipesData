    "des": "\"A quick and easy marinade that packs a lot of flavor, perfect if you love balsamic vinegar. You can also try rice wine vinegar for the white. Great with chicken, steak, shrimp, and tofu, or even try your favorite vegetables. You'll never miss the oil! The marinade is very acidic, so marinate vegetables and seafood for less time to keep them from becoming mushy. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.\"",
