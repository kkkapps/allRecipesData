    "ins": "Heat coconut oil over medium heat in a large skillet; cook and stir bacon, onion, and garlic until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir cabbage into bacon mixture and toss to coat with oil. Cover skillet, reduce the heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage begins to soften, about 10 minutes.\nStir cider vinegar and brown sugar together in a bowl; pour over cabbage mixture. Stir apples into cabbage mixture; cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated and cabbage is tender, about 35 minutes. Remove pan from heat and allow cabbage mixture to stand, covered, for about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.",
