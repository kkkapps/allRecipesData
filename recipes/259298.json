    "des": "\"It is best to use very small chicken fillets for this classic Mexican dish (pollo al chipotle). The chicken is simmered in a spicy, smoky Mexican sauce made with chipotle peppers and cream.\"",
    "ins": "Season chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium to high heat. Saute chicken in the hot pan until browned, about 5 to 8 minutes per side.\nMash chipotle peppers in a bowl with a fork and mix with cream. Pour over browned chicken and simmer until chicken is fully cooked, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
