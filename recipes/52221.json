    "ins": "Place the crawfish, crab, and shrimp in a large glass or ceramic bowl; pick any shells from the meat.  Pour in the lime juice, and gently mix, being careful not to break up the crab meat.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the ketchup, hot sauce, and olive oil.  Stir in the cilantro, onion, cucumber, jicama, and jalapeno; add salt to taste.  Gently fold this mixture into the seafood.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Add the avocado just before serving.",
