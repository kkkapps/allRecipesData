    "des": "\"For a healthy and tasty take on the cheesy Mexican snack, fill your quesadillas with nutritious GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Low Sodium Black Beans! GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Beans are high in fiber, very low in fat and boast more fiber than most whole grain foods. Simply mix the beans with GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Pico de Gallo, freshly chopped herbs and a handful of cheese, fill the quesadilla, and cook. The results: the same gooey taste we crave, plus more!\"",
    "ins": "Using small-hole strainer, drain liquid from Pico de Gallo Salsa; discard liquid. Transfer remaining tomato mixture to medium bowl. Mix in black beans, cheese and cilantro until combined.\nDivide black bean mixture evenly over half of each tortilla (about 1/2 cup each). Fold tortillas in half.\nHeat large griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush with oil. Place filled tortillas on griddle. Cook, carefully flipping once, until tortillas are golden brown and crisp and cheese filling melts, about 5 minutes.\nCut quesadillas into wedges. Serve with your favorite GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Salsita variety, if desired.",
