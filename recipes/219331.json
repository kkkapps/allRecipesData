    "des": "\"A cheesy casserole with all of your favorite pizza toppings. I like to serve this with a salad and garlic bread.  The leftovers are great.  I have prepared this in advance and then taken it to potlucks in a slow cooker the next day.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCook the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, breaking the meat apart into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles in the boiling water until cooked through yet slightly firm, about 5 minutes; drain.\nMix the noodles with the spaghetti sauce, black olives, mushrooms, pepperoni, and half the mozzarella cheese in a large mixing bowl; spoon the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with remaining half of the mozzarella cheese. Cover the dish with foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes.",
