    "des": "\"In an effort to eat healthier, I came up with this recipe for a much healthier zucchini bread, and I was pleasantly surprised that something that is good for you tastes so good. I have raspberry plants and a garden with zucchini so these are plentiful at this time of year. I also have an apple tree where I cook the apples down with no sugar added and then jar them for later use.\"",
