    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium to low heat.\nLay a piece of foil large enough to hold all the ingredients flat on a table. Place the potatoes in the center of the foil, pour the soup over the potatoes, then top with the mushrooms and onion. Arrange the butter all over and around the vegetables and then top off with your favorite seasonings. Now either fold foil over to seal or use another large piece to seal the entire package.\nGrill over medium to low heat on a top rack, if possible, for 1 hour.",
