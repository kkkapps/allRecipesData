Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced to 4 cups, about 20 minutes.\nStir apple butter and hot sauce into root beer; reduce heat to low and simmer to keep warm, stirring occasionally, while frying shanks.\nHeat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGently lower pork shanks into hot oil, 2 or 3 at a time, and deep-fry until meat is crisp and brown, about 3 minutes per batch. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.\nServe pork shanks slathered with hot apple butter sauce.",
