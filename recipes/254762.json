    "des": "\"If you have grown up, lived, or traveled to the Midwest, this recipe is from a popular restaurant that was in Lincoln, NE. I've been told it's an acquired taste, but having grown up on them, I love them! It's a loose meat sandwich. Use a slotted spoon to portion out the meat. Serve on buns with mustard and sliced dill pickles.\"",
    "ins": "Combine ketchup, salt, mustard, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, and ground black pepper in a 1-cup measuring cup. Add more ketchup if combined ingredients don't equal 1 cup. Stir until well mixed. Place ground beef in a stock pot; pour ketchup mixture over the ground beef.\nFill the same measuring cup with warm water. Stir to loosen any fine seasoning remaining; pour into stock pot. Stir onion into ground beef mixture; add monosodium glutamate. Mix until ingredients are well combined.\nCook and stir the ground beef mixture over low heat until the ground beef is finely crumbled, about 15 minutes. Bring to a boil; cook until flavors blend, about 25 minutes.",
