    "des": "\"The chocolate on your lobster will melt in your mouth like butter. Although it sounds weird, honestly, this is the best recipe ever! This is great with steamed lobster also.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat your oven's broiler. Split the lobster down the back shell, remove the vein from the lobster's tail, and the sac that is behind the eyes. Insert a long skewer into the tail to keep from curling.\nBroil the lobster about 5 inches from the heat for about 5 minutes on each side, or until the meat is opaque. Remove skewer from tail.\nWhile the lobster is cooking, make the chocolate sauce. In a small glass bowl, combine the chocolate, milk, and butter. Microwave on high, stirring every 15 to 20 seconds until melted and smooth. Pour chocolate sauce over lobster, and serve.",
