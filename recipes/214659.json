Set the last batch of 5 crumbled cookies aside; place the remaining cookies into the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan, and smooth into a crust.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over low heat, and stir in the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, and vegetable oil into a smooth mixture. Pour in the beaten eggs, and whisk constantly until the mixture is hot (do not boil) and thickened to a fudgy consistency, about 5 minutes. Pour the thickened fudge over the crushed cookie crust, smooth into a layer, and freeze cake at least 30 minutes.\nSet the peppermint ice cream out to soften for about 10 minutes. Cut the softened ice cream into slices, and place the ice cream slices over the fudge filling. Smooth the ice cream out into an even layer, and sprinkle reserved crushed cookies on top for garnish. Freeze the dessert for 1 to 2 hours before serving.",
