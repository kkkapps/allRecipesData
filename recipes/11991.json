    "des": "\"This is your basic old fashioned recipe for egg noodles, just like grammy used to make! Try making them next time you prepare your favorite soup or stew. Don't forget that fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried! You may use a dough hook attachment on your electric mixer or your hands to make the pasta dough.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Add the beaten egg, milk, and butter. Knead dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let rest in a covered bowl for 10 minutes.\nOn a floured surface, roll out to 1/8 or 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired lengths and shapes.\nAllow to air dry before cooking.\nTo cook fresh pasta, in a large pot with boiling salted water cook until al dente.",
