    "ins": "In a large pot, combine the apple juice, ginger ale and brown sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Stir in the whiskey and spiced rum and let stand for 1 hour. Pour into 1 gallon jugs or containers and place a cinnamon stick in each one. Cover and store until serving. This can be served warm, but don't heat too much or the alcohol will burn off.",
