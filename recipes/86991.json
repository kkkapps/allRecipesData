    "des": "\"There's an awesome little restaurant in Marina Del Rey, California called 'Killer Shrimp' that serves up one thing -- Shrimp soup. This is an easy to prepare spicy herb soup with lots of broth, flavor, and a little kick. It doesn't need any fancy presentation. Simply ladle it into big bowls and serve. Don't bother using spoons, just serve it with some crusty bread and use the bread to soak up the broth.\"",
    "ins": "Pour broth into a large pot, and mix in rosemary, garlic, pepper, celery seed, fennel seed, clam juice, tomato paste, and butter. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally.\nStir wine into the soup, and continue to simmer and occasionally stir 2 hours.\nJust before serving, stir in shrimp. Continue cooking 3 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque. Serve with bread for soaking up all the yummy broth.",
