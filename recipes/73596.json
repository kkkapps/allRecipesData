    "des": "\"If you are not familiar with banana squash, this is a great 'first-timer' recipe to try. Cubed squash is simmered, then glazed in a simple citrus sauce. It is basically foolproof and everyone will love it! Even my kids ate it up. This serves well with chicken, pork and fish.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add squash cubes and water. Cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, or until squash is tender. Stir occasionally, and add more water if necessary to prevent squash from sticking to the pan.\nReduce heat to low, and stir in the orange juice, apricot preserves, cloves, salt and pepper. Cook and stir uncovered until squash is evenly glazed.",
