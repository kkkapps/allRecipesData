    "des": "\"Another recipe taught to me by my beloved mother-in-law in Puerto Rico. The only changes I have made is the reduction of additional table salt; the sazon seasoning has plenty. A savory,  melt-in-your mouth skirt steak recipe that is slow-roasted with diced vegetables and seasonings. Perfect served with arroz con gandules and tostones.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nSprinkle sazon seasoning and black pepper over steaks; rub in lightly with your fingers. Arrange steaks close together, but not overlapping, in a large casserole dish.\nMix green bell peppers, red bell peppers, onion, and garlic together in a large bowl. Spoon over steaks in the casserole dish. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until peppers are soft and steaks are cooked through, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
