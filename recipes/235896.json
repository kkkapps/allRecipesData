    "des": "\"Find yourself a nice decorative box to put these in. It doesn't hurt if it has the word 'love' on it. And then you present these as your gift for Valentine's Day. The flavor profile for these is just perfect: dark chocolate with just a hint of warmth.\"",
    "ins": "Place chocolate into a bowl; add chipotle pepper and salt.\nHeat cream in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until it comes to a boil. Pour cream over chocolate and let stand for 3 minutes.\nStir gently until chocolate mixture is completely smooth. Pour chocolate mixture out onto a sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Pick up one edge of the plastic and roll the chocolate into a rough log shape. Continue to roll, wrapping chocolate in the plastic. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nPlace cocoa into a small bowl. Unwrap chocolate and cut in half crosswise; cut each half into halves lengthwise. Roughly cut candy into 1/2-inch square 'stones'. Place the chocolate pieces into the cocoa and toss gently to coat.",
