    "des": "\"These fabulous 'cookies' come out around the middle of October and are traditionally eaten on All-Saints Day (November 1) in Catalonia, Spain.  The traditional ones are made with pine nuts, but you can also find them with almond or coconut.\"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes in a small saucepan; cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender; drain. Mash the potatoes with a fork. Allow to cool.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking sheet.\nCombine the cooled potatoes and almonds. Slowly add the sugar while stirring with a wooden spoon. Stir in the lemon zest; continue mixing with your hands. Form the dough into 1-inch balls. Roll the balls in the pine nuts; brush with egg yolk. Form each ball into a crescent shape. Cover each cookie with cornstarch and then brush with egg white. Arrange cookies on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until lightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes.",
