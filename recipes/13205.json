    "des": "\"The finest of all cold soups--and the very best thing invented in the USA! This wonderful, smooth soup can be garnished with a very few finely chopped chives.  The chef at the Algonquin (where the soup originated) now sprinkles a very little curry powder, and provided it is a VERY little this can be very pleasant. Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Gently sweat the chopped leeks and the chopped onion in butter or margarine until soft, about 8 minutes.  Do NOT let them brown.\nAdd potatoes and stock to the saucepan.  Salt and pepper to taste; do not overdo them!   Bring to the boil, and simmer very gently for 30 minutes.\nPuree in a blender or food processor until very smooth.  Cool.  Gently stir in the cream before serving.",
