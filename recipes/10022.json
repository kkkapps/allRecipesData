Add  confectioners' sugar and 2 egg whites; process until smooth.\nWhisk remaining 2 egg whites in small bowl. Place pine nuts on shallow plate. With lightly floured hands roll dough into 1 inch balls. Coat balls in egg whites, shaking off excess, then roll in pine nuts, pressing lightly to stick. Arrange balls on cookie sheets, and flatten slightly to form a 1 1/2 inch round.\nBake 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Let stand on cookie sheet 1 minute.  Transfer to wire rack to cool.",
