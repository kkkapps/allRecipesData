Remove from oven and set aside to cool until cool enough to handle, keeping oven heat at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nHalve potatoes lengthwise and scoop potato from each half into a bowl, leaving about 1/4 inch of the potato attached to the skin all the way around.\nMelt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in butter until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir scooped potato, Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream, and most of the green onion together with the garlic and butter; cook and stir the mixture until heated and smooth, about 5 minutes.\nScoop the potato mixture into the potato skins and arrange onto the baking sheet.\nBake in oven until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with remaining green onion, bacon, and paprika.",
