    "des": "\"A family favorite that is great for entertaining any time of the year.  Very simple and elegant to make ahead.  Simply delicious!  Cut into squares and top with warm chocolate or caramel sauce.  For holidays, you may add crushed candy canes on top of the warm sauce -- and try butter pecan or peppermint ice cream instead of vanilla!\"",
