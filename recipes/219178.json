    "ins": "Place the yeast, sugar, and water in the pan of a bread machine. Allow yeast to dissolve and foam, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, rolled oats, powdered milk, and salt in a bowl; set aside. Add the honey, vegetable oil, and butter to the yeast mixture, and pour the flour mixture on top.\nSelect the Dough cycle; press start. Allow the bread machine to complete the cycle, about 1 1/2 hours, then transfer the dough to a 9x5-inch loaf pan sprayed with cooking spray. Allow the bread to rise for 1 hour in a warm place.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes.",
