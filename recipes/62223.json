    "des": "\"I feel that the apple cider makes this jerk marinade unique, and a bit untraditional. Being from the apple country of Virginia, the apple cider was a natural. For added flavor, add apple or hickory wood chips soaked in water on top of the hot coals. You can begin grilling when the chips start smoking. Grilled pineapple goes well with this as a side dish.\"",
    "ins": "Combine habanero peppers, onion, green onions, ginger, and garlic, in a blender or food processor. Blend until quite fine. Add cider, white vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, and sugar. Season with mustard seed, salt, pepper, thyme, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Continue to blend until smooth.\nPlace the pork tenderloin in a shallow casserole dish. Spread mixture on all sides of the meat (wear gloves or use a spatula). Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours.\nPreheat grill for medium-high heat.\nLightly oil grate. Add soaked wood chips to coals, if using. Grill slabs of tenderloin, turning as needed, about 6 to 7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature has reached 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nRemove meat from grill; allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly and serve.",
