    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRinse and trim the chicken breasts. Pat dry. Generously coat both sides of each breast with sour cream. Put crushed cornflake crumbs in a shallow plate or bowl and season to taste (I use onion salt and garlic salt). Dip the sour cream coated chicken in the seasoned cornflake crumbs.\nPlace coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle with melted butter/margarine and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.",
