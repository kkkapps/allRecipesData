    "ins": "In a mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese and lemon juice. Mix with a fork and gradually combine the shrimp. Refrigerate the mold in a plastic bowl for 2 hours.\nIn a second mixing bowl, while the mold chills, combine the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, horseradish and lemon juice. Chill the sauce at least 30 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\nRemove the mold from the refrigerator. Invert the bowl and place the mold upside down on a serving platter. If necessary, shape the mold into the form of a mountain. Indent the top of the mold and pour the chilled sauce into the indentation, allowing it to flow over the sides.",
