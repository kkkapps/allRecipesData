    "des": "\"A new way to use rhubarb, it plays off the nutty flavor of wild rice. This makes an attractive, unexpected side for fish or poultry. It has become a requested holiday dish in our family.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread almonds onto a baking sheet.\nToast almonds in preheated oven until golden and fragrant, 7 to 10 minutes.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until just translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix rhubarb into onion and garlic and saute until slightly softened, about 2 minutes more.\nStir wine wine, raisins, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper into rhubarb mixture; cover the skillet with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until rhubarb is tender to the bite but still firm, 5 to 8 minutes. Add honey and soy sauce; stir.\nMix wild rice and white rice into the rhubarb mixture; cook and stir until rice is heated through. Top with toasted almonds.",
