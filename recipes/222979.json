    "ins": "Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nBeat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Spread flour in another dish and bread crumbs in a third dish.\nWorking with one piece at a time, gently press chicken into the flour to coat and shake off the excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded chicken onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken in batches of 2 or 3 pieces until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer cooked chicken to a baking sheet and keep warm in preheated oven while cooking remaining chicken.\nServe with lemon wedges.",
