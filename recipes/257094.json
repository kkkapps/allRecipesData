    "ins": "Combine 9 eggs, water, and all-purpose flour in a large bowl. Blend with an electric mixer until batter is completely smooth. Let batter rest for 30 minutes.\nHeat an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat; brush with some butter. Pour 2 1/2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan, swirling to coat the bottom. Cook until the top is dry to the touch and bottom is still pale, about 30 seconds. Transfer crepe to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.\nWhisk 3 eggs in a large bowl. Stir in ricotta cheese. Fold in mint, salt, and pepper until well combined.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace 1/3 cup of the ricotta mixture on one end of a crepe. Roll over once and pull the other end up over the top. Repeat with remaining ricotta mixture and crepes.\nCover the bottom of a large baking dish with some pasta sauce. Arrange filled crepes on top. Cover filled crepes with a little more sauce. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 55 minutes.",
