Add the onion and garlic and saute for 5 minutes, or until tender. Add the beans, ribs, broth, water, chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt, ground black pepper and fresh cilantro. Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is tender.\nRemove the ribs, allow to cool and remove meat from the bones. Return meat to broth.  Chill the broth until the fat rises to the surface and remove the fat. Bring back to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.",
