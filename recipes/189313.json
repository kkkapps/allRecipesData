    "des": "\"Yummy Greek caviar spread that will impress your guests and leftovers freeze well! Serve chilled with pita or crunchy bread. Leftovers can be frozen and thawed in the refrigerator when you have a craving again.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick the potato in several places with a fork and place on a baking sheet.\nBake the potato in the preheated oven easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool completely in refrigerator. Peel and chop.\nPlace the bread slices in a shallow dish; pour the milk over the bread to cover completely. Allow to soak a few minutes before squeezing as much moisture as possible from the bread, discarding the milk.\nBlend the bread, potato, carp roe, onion, lemon juice, and olive oil together in a food processor until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add more olive oil if needed to reach a desired consistency; chill. Garnish with the Greek olives to serve.",
