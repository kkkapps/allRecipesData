    "des": "\"My grandmother would pan-fry beet greens with garlic and olive oil. Following her example, I added sun-dried tomatoes and capers for a little more pop! The kids love it and it's quick and easy. Please note, although I have measurements listed, I am a 'pinch here and pinch there' type of cook. You may need to adjust for your personal taste.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until it begins to turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir garlic into the onion; cook together about 1 minute. Fold the beet greens into the onion mixture, stirring to coat; cook until the greens wilt, 3 to 5 minutes. Add capers and sun-dried tomatoes; cook and stir until hot, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat; season dish with sea salt and black pepper.",
