    "ins": "Pulse drained cherries in a food processor until chopped. Transfer to a large bowl. Add yogurt, evaporated milk, sugar, half-and-half, milk, and creme de cassis liqueur; mix well.\nPour into an electric mixer's ice cream attachment. Follow manufacturer's instructions and mix for 25 minutes on the 'stir' setting.\nPour the chilled mixture into a freeze-proof container and freeze until it reaches \"soft-serve\" consistency, about 2 hours. Transfer frozen yogurt to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal.",
