    "ins": "After roasting a chicken, remove it from the roasting pan and place on a serving tray to rest. Leave the oven on. Pour off excess drippings from the roasting pan, leaving just enough to coat the broccoli. Toss broccoli and garlic in the drippings until coated and place in the still hot oven. Roast for 5 to 8 minutes, until tender.",
