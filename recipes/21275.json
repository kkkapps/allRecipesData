    "des": "\"French toast and bananas are a perfect pair. This recipe sounds more difficult than it is. Give it a try, you'll love it! Try garnishing the toast with strawberries, powdered sugar and maple syrup.\"",

Lightly spray a cast iron or other ovenproof skillet with cooking spray and then heat over medium heat.\nSpread mashed banana on top of 4 slices of bread. Place remaining four slices on top.
