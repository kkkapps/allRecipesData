    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nMix together the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, corn, salt, and black pepper in a bowl.\nFill the jalapeno halves with the cream cheese mixture.\nWrap each stuffed pepper with bacon, securing it with a toothpick. Be sure the toothpick pokes through the bacon as well as the pepper.\nPlace the poppers face down on the grill over direct heat. Grill until bacon is crispy and brown, about 5 minutes; turn the poppers over and grill until bacon is crisp on other side, 5 more minutes.",
