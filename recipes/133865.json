    "ins": "In a Dutch oven, large enough to hold your chicken, combine the barbeque sauce, 1 liter of cola and grape jelly. Add the chicken and pour in more cola if needed to cover it. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium-low heat for 1 hour, adding more cola as needed to keep the chicken covered.\nPreheat a grill for medium heat. Remove the chicken from the sauce, and place on the grill.\nCook, turning frequently for about 20 minutes, just until the skin is crispy. Heat the leftover sauce over high heat and boil for about 10 minutes to serve alongside the chicken.",
