    "des": "\"My casserole is amazing! As an aspiring chef, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I'm 18 and this is one of my creations. Your family will love this dish for its melted cheese and soft potatoes. It's a good way to get calcium in your diet as well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a large pot over high heat, place the potatoes with water to cover and bring to a boil. Let boil for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Add the milk, mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese.\nUsing an electric mixer, beat the potatoes until almost smooth. Then beat in the eggs, drain the tuna and stir the tuna into the potato mixture. Then stir in the green onion, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTransfer mixture to a lightly-greased 10-inch diameter glass pie dish and top with the remaining Parmesan cheese.\nBake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.",
