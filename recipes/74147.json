    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Whisk the cocoa powder and artificial sweetener together in a small bowl; set aside. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBeat egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy in a large mixing bowl. Add the vanilla, and beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Fold in the cocoa powder mixture until evenly blended. Drop tablespoon-sized dollops of meringue onto the lined baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until the macaroons are crisp and dry, about 1 hour. Cool completely on a wire rack.",
