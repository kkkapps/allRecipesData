    "des": "\"I use this goat cheese dressing to add flavor to under-ripe fruit, as a way to make a fruit salad 'classier', or even as a spread on toast in the morning. This recipe is particularly nice with solid fruits like honeydew, cantaloupe, musk melon, guava, or papaya because they occasionally can be less sweet or juicy than would be desirable. For aesthetic purposes, shake the cinnamon over the top of the dressing just before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Blend goat cheese, butter, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a blender until smooth. Slowly pour milk into the mixture, a few tablespoons at a time; blend until the desired consistency is reached. You will want it to be thin enough to drizzle over fruit. Blend cinnamon into the dressing at the end.",
