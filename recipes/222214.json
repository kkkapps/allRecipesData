    "des": "\"I have looked all over for a great macaroni salad; this one is it! It's easy and is a huge hit at every function I take it to. The sauce for this is a great creamy sauce. I like my salads to have a lot of creamy dressing, so I always make an extra half batch of the wet mix and add it as necessary to get the salad more wet because the pasta soaks up the sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Mix salt, dry mustard, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, white pepper, and black pepper in a small bowl.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse macaroni under cold water until cooled.\nWhisk mayonnaise, sour cream, and evaporated milk in a large salad bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy; stir in seasoning mix until well blended. Mix macaroni, onion, green, red, and yellow bell pepper, celery, and carrots into the dressing until thoroughly coated.",
