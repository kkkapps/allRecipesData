    "des": "\"This casserole is perfect for Thanksgiving or any other fall meal. The sweetness of the squash and the potatoes are a pleasant combination. I make this recipe with apple Gouda chicken sausages from Costco\u00c2\u00ae but any other chicken sausage will do the trick. I originally created this recipe by combining extras in the fridge that needed to be cooked. Now, it is a staple in our home and everyone loves it!\"",

Cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Scoop flesh out of the skins; place in a 9x13-inch casserole dish.\nBring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan.
