Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.\nCook French fries according to package instructions while steak is marinating.\nIn a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute steak, peppers and onions until vegetables are tender and steak is cooked to your liking.  Separate steak mixture into 8 equal portions while in the skillet, and top each portion with cheese.  Cover and set aside to let cheese melt.\nArrange lettuce, tomatoes and garbanzo beans on 8 separate plates.  Top each salad with 1/8 of the French fries and 1/8 of the steak mixture and serve with Ranch-style salad dressing.",
