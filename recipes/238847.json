    "des": "\"When I've made 'barbeque meatloaf' before I've simply used the standard spoon-the-glaze-on-top-of-the-loaf-and-bake-it method. This time I wanted to line the loaf pan with some of the sauce, press the meat in, and let it roast in the goodness. I was envisioning a beautiful, glossy finish when I turned it on to the serving platter. It wasn't quite as aesthetically pleasing as I hoped (ugly). But, hey--this is quick and dirty home cooking. It may not have looked good, but it tasted fine!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nMix ground beef, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, celery salt, chipotle chile powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl with your hands.\nStir breadcrumbs, egg, ketchup, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce into meat mixture until thoroughly combined; form into a loaf shape.\nSpread barbeque sauce out into the bottom of a loaf pan; place meatloaf on top of barbeque sauce and press into pan.\nBake meatloaf in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour, 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain the fat from the loaf pan and invert pan over a plate to transfer meatloaf. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.",
