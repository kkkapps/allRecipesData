    "des": "\"My take on the long green beans you find in some of the Asian fusion restaurants. If you don't have the Szechuan peppercorns this dish will still taste great, though you may want to add some chili flakes or other spice to give it some pep instead of the peppercorns.\"",

Grind peppercorns using a mortar and pestle.\nHeat peanut oil in a small skillet over medium heat; add garlic and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
