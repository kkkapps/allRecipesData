    "des": "\"Growing up in snowy Canadian winters, my mom would always make my brothers and me hot cocoa after a night of tobogganing. When I got older - and had long since abandoned real cocoa for the instant variety - I had a craving one night for a more wholesome treat. Here's my recipe for a creamier, homestyle cup of cocoa. Perfect for those snowy winter nights!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan; stir in boiling water. Whisk until sugar is dissolved.\nBring cocoa mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes; stir milk and 1/2 cup half-and-half into water mixture. Cook and stir just until hot, about 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat; stir in remaining half-and-half and vanilla extract.\nDivide cocoa into mugs, top with marshmallows, and serve.",
