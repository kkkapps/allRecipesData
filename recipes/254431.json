    "des": "\"This is a great set-it-and-forget-it recipe using Knorr\u00c2\u00ae Spanish rice. Just prepare the rice (or use some leftover rice from the night before), mix it with a few freezer staples, beans, salsa, and spices, and blam! The best chili ever after a few hours in the slow cooker. Garnish with cheese, sour cream, and/or diced onions. This would also go great on top of a big pile of fries on game day.\"",
    "ins": "Combine water, Spanish rice mix, and vegetable oil in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender, about 7 minutes.\nPour rice into a slow cooker.
