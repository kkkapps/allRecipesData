    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Set aside.\nTrim any excess fat from the tenderloin.\nIn a small bowl, combine espresso, brown sugar, and spices for the rub. Coat all sides of the tenderloin with the rub, creating a crust around the beef.\nPlace a rack on top of the foil-lined sheet and brush lightly with olive oil. Set the beef on your prepared rack and insert an oven-safe meat thermometer into the center. Roast, uncovered, for 50-60 minutes, or until the thermometer reads 135 degrees (for medium rare).\nRemove from the oven and cover with foil. Let stand for 15 minutes. The internal temperature of the roast will increase to 145 degrees F while resting. Cut into 1/2-inch slices and serve.",
