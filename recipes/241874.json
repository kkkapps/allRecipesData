    "des": "\"There's a Mexican joint Michele and I go to once in a while that serves a complimentary bowl of spicy, fried chickpeas when you sit down to eat. It's a very nice touch, and a periodic reminder of what a great, highly-addictive snack this is. As in, only make single batches at a time, because you will eat everything you make. Season with any combination of spices that you like.\"",
    "ins": "Place chickpeas in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand for 24 hours. Drain and dry on paper towels.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPour chickpeas into a baking dish; drizzle olive oil over the top and season with cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Stir to coat chickpeas.\nBake in the preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes, until crispy and fragrant, about 1 hour. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
