    "ins": "Peel potatoes if desired. Cut into 2-inch pieces and place in a large sauce pan or Dutch oven. Cover with water and bring to a boil over high heat.  Boil 15 to 20 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain well in a colander.\nReturn potatoes to pan; toss briefly over low heat to dry off extra moisture.  Mash warm potatoes with a masher or hand-held electric mixer until chunky.\nGradually add warm broth while mashing until potatoes are desired consistency.  Mix in parsley and season with salt and pepper, if desired.  Cover pan and heat over very low heat to keep warm up to about 30 minutes before serving. Serve with gravy, sour cream, butter or chives, if desired.",
