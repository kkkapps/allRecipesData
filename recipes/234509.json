    "des": "\"A very thick and savory, vegetarian soup. The squash, butter, and almonds give this soup a really decadent flavor. Tastes great served with fresh yogurt or sour cream and garnished with either green onions or a dash of cinnamon.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook almonds in the melted butter until light brown, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup vegetable broth into the pot; bring to a simmer and cook until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes.\nPour remaining broth into the pot; add butternut squash, carrots, onion, and garlic. Pour enough water into the pot to assure the vegetables are completely submerged; bring to a simmer and cook until the carrots are completely soft and the volume of the liquid has reduced by about 1/3, 15 to 20 minutes.\nPour broth mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.\nPour pureed soup into a separate vessel. Stir Worcestershire sauce, cinnamon, chili powder, brown sugar, and salt into the soup.",
