    "ins": "Pour the olive oil into a skillet and set over medium heat. Add the garlic clove, and cook until the clove is browned. Remove the garlic from the oil, and finely crumble the slices of bread into the skillet.  Cook until nicely toasted, then scoop out the crumbs onto a paper towel. Reserve the oil.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, and cook for about 8 minutes, until tender. Drain.\nMix the reserved oil into the spaghetti, then place onto serving plates. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and freshly ground black pepper.",
