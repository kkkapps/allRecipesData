    "des": "\"The hubby and I are trying to eat less meat, more veggies. These hold together very well, have good flavor and are very moist. After the first bite the hubby asked me to write down the recipe before anything was forgotten. I look forward to seeing the tweaks people will make to improve on a good base. Enjoy!\"",

Mix onion, carrot, green pepper, mushrooms, and garlic into potato mixture with a fork, mashing until well-mixed.\nStir Worcestershire sauce, cumin, chili powder, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture. Form mixture into 8 patties.\nWorking in batches, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot oil until golden and set on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes; flip each burger and cook until golden and hot throughout, about 4 minutes more.",
