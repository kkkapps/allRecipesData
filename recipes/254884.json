    "ins": "Combine curing mixture and liquid smoke together in a bowl; mix into a paste. Pat paste on inside and outside of turkey. Place turkey in a resealable plastic bag; refrigerate for 24 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWash turkey inside and out with cold water; dry. Pat with cooking oil. Place turkey in an oven bag; poke holes into bag for ventilation according to manufacturer's instructions. Set bagged turkey into a 9x13-inch baking pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Reduce heat to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bake until turkey comes easily off the bone and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 6 hours.",
