    "des": "\"This is the first recipe for crepes that I have ever been able to make right.  I was psyched that I didn't have to use egg replacer because it is such a pain in the neck.  So here you vegans go and enjoy but don't eat too many too fast like I did cause now I have a belly ache!!!!  For a twist, replace the maple syrup with hazelnut syrup, or any other flavor you like. If you want to throw some semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top and fold the crepe up over them, they melt and get all gushy on the inside. Makes about 16 crepes with a 6-inch diameter.\"",

Cover and chill the mixture for 2 hours.\nLightly grease a 5 to 6 inch skillet with some soy margarine. Heat the skillet until hot. Pour approximately 3 tablespoons batter into the skillet.  Swirl to make the batter cover the skillet's bottom.  Cook until golden, flip and cook on opposite side.",
