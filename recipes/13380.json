    "ins": "In a large stock pot, add water, ham bone and pre-soaked beans.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until beans are close to soft.\nRemove bone and cut off remaining meat.  Remove 1/3 of beans and mash with potato masher or food processor.\nReturn ham and beans back to stock pot and add onion, carrots, celery, garlic powder, pepper and paprika.  If you are using dripping from a previously cooked ham add those now.  Simmer until vegetables are tender and serve.",
