    "des": "\"I put this recipe together to use up some bananas and persimmon that were very very ripe! As soon as they began to bake, my daughter said she could smell autumn.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 6 muffin cups with paper liners.\nMash bananas and persimmon together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 3/4 cup sugar, coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.\nSift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture using a spoon just until batter is combined. Fill each muffin cup 3/4-full with batter.\nMix 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 23 minutes.",
