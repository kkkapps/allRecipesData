Add to flour mixture all at once, stirring just until moistened (if dough is too dry, add additional milk 1 teaspoon at a time, until dry ingredients are moistened). Drop dough by 1/4 cupfuls onto prepared cookie sheet. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar.\nBake 15 to 20 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Serve warm.",
