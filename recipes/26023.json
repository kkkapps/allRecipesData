    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 11x7 inch pan.\nIn a large bowl, mix flour and sugar together. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve 1/2 cup of this mixture as crumbs for top of cake.\nTo the remaining flour mixture stir in the cinnamon, cloves, baking soda and salt. Blend in egg and buttermilk. Pour batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle reserved crumb mixture over top.\nBake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.",
