I have tried this with aspartame sugar substitute (the blue packets) to lower the sugar, and no one could tell!  For best results, transfer frozen mixture to a plastic freezer container and freeze for at least one hour before serving (if you can keep your kids out of it for that long!).\"",

Transfer mixture to the freezer canister of an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.  When ice cream begins to stiffen, add walnuts and chocolate chips.",
