    "des": "\"This soy sauce and sesame flavored dip is great for egg rolls, fresh or fried spring rolls, grilled meats or poultry.  Chill or heat before serving. This is also a great dressing for coleslaw -- just toss the slaw with the dressing and chill for up to 3 days. Add some shelled sunflower seeds and some crunchy chow mein noodles right before serving.\"",
