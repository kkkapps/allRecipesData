    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nSeason both sides of each catfish fillet with Greek seasoning. Sprinkle feta cheese and mint over one side of each fillet; drizzle olive oil over the cheese and mint. Beginning with narrower end, roll fish tightly around the filling and secure with a toothpick.\nCook on preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.",
