    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the margarine, peanut butter, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and almond extracts. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Use a wet fork dipped in sugar to make the crisscrosses on the top.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Grab a glass of milk and enjoy!",
