Add milk, oats, egg, and baking powder; stir until batter is well-combined.\nHeat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Drop 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto the skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter evenly into a round. Cover with a lid and cook until pancake is browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving plate.",
