If my toddler is any judge, it's scrumptious, too! You may substitute cranberry juice for the grape juice if you wish.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the cereal to the cheese then add the juice to the mixture until it holds together.  Stir in milk until the cereal is pasty but not lumpy.",
