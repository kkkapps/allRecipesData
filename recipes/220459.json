    "des": "\"An Irish car bomb is a drink that has a shot of Irish cream liqueur and Irish whiskey dropped in the shot glass, down into a glass of Guinness\u00c2\u00ae beer. There are several recipes that replicate this flavor out there, but this is different in that there is no icing and lends itself to being taken to the pub easier.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGrease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)) and coat inside of pan with unsweetened cocoa powder.\nBeat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, 1 egg, and Irish cream liqueur in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Set aside.\nBeat chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding mix, 3 eggs, and vegetable oil in a separate bowl until batter is thick and smooth. Slowly beat Irish stout beer into the batter.\nSpoon 1/3 of the cake batter into the prepared pan; layer the Irish cream filling on top. Spoon remaining cake batter over the filling.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.\nLoosen the edges of the cake from the pan with a thin spatula; let cake rest in pan 15 minutes. Invert pan over a wire rack to release cake and allow to cool completely on the rack.\nWhile cake is cooling, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in white sugar and Irish whiskey. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.\nTransfer cake to a serving platter. Generously brush whiskey glaze over cooled cake several times and allow glaze to soak into cake.",
