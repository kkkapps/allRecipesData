    "des": "\"I grew up with cauliflower boiled and served with buttered crumbs. Although I love melted butter, the two never melded for me, and cauliflower remained my least favorite vegetable until I discovered this recipe from Indian friends. \nI omitted the chile and prepared it for my brother who cannot tolerate any hot spice, and he raved about it. \nIt's flavorful, and the microwave finish leaves the cauliflower slightly crisp, which we prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat; add mustard seeds and cover skillet. Cook until seeds stop popping, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion to the skillet; cook and stir over low heat until translucent, about 10 minutes.\nMix garlic, ginger, turmeric, chile powder, and salt into onion mixture; cook and stir for 30 seconds. Add cauliflower; cook and stir for 1 minute. Transfer cauliflower to a microwave-safe bowl and cover bowl.\nCook cauliflower in microwave until tender, about 3 minutes. Drizzle lemon juice over cauliflower.",
