    "des": "\"These are very easy and quick to make.  To make them even faster, you can make the dough the night before, cover and store in refrigerator overnight. That way in the morning all you have to do is heat your oil, cook and serve.  Look like small puffed doughnut holes. I like them tossed in a plastic bag with cinnamon and sugar.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, mix flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, mace and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Create a well in the center of the mixture, and pour in milk, canola oil and egg. Thoroughly stir into the mixture.\nIn batches, drop the mixture by rounded teaspoonfuls into the hot oil. Fry on all sides, 2 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.\nIn a resealable plastic bag, mix 1 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. While still warm, place balls a few at a time into the bag, and toss to coat.",
