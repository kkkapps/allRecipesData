    "des": "\"My partner, Andy, loves potatoes so much I have nicknamed him 'Spudley!' Potatoes are the one thing he desperately misses on a low-carb diet. He loved these potatoes and dubbed them 'just beautiful.' Bombay potatoes are a very popular Indian side dish in the United Kingdom.\"",
    "ins": "Place the turnips into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the yellow mustard seeds, black mustard seeds, and turmeric in the oil until the mustard seeds begin to pop. Add the turnips to the skillet; cook and stir until the turnips are completely heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt to serve.",
