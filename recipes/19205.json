    "des": "\"I came up with this scrumptious recipe one day, just trying to find a way to use the bag of coconut flakes sitting in the cupboard.  It was just a cross between family recipes for cookies and my own special touch of imagination.  Well I'm glad that I came up with it as are my family and friends.  I hope you enjoy as much as we did.\"",

Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in chocolate chips and coconut. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
