    "des": "\"Pita bread sandwiches with scrambled eggs and potatoes. Very quick. I sometimes make it for myself when I'm rushed. This recipe is great for using up leftovers, and is very versatile: you can add any other seasonings you like, and you can use egg substitute if you prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350  degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pita bread in oven to warm.\nHeat a medium skillet over high heat. Coat with cooking spray. Add potatoes and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add eggs. Mix gently until eggs are firm, about 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper. Remove pita from oven. Stuff pita with potato and egg mixture. Eat immediately.",
