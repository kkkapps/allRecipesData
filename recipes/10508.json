    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat margarine and sugars, until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.  Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. Sift and add to the egg mixture. Stir well.\nGrind the raisins up with 1 teaspoon of sugar until they are in small pieces--not mush!  Stir in oats, nuts, raisins and mix well, drop by tablespoonful onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until light brown. Cool 1 minute and remove to wire rack. When cool store in airtight container.  NOTE:  You can add butterscotch or chocolate pieces in place of the raisins.",
