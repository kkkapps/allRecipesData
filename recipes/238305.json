    "des": "\"Fried plantains are a traditional treat in many parts of the world. Try them once and you'll be hooked. Yellow (ripe) work best. Serve this as a sweet and savory side dish to a meal, as a dessert, or as a snack. They are also delicious atop a dark, leafy, and green spinach or kale salad with goat cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Cut plantain into three sections. Quarter each section so you have twelve pieces. Season plantain pieces with garlic powder.\nHeat oil and margarine together in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook plantains in hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side; season with black pepper and continue to cook until slightly darker in color, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat and drizzle agave syrup over the plantain pieces. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon over the plantains.",
