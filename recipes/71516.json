    "des": "\"This recipe was given me by my aunt, who loves Mediterranean cooking. A delicious, refreshing salad made from shredded cabbage and a dressing made from lemon, garlic, olive oil, and cilantro. The proportions I listed will at least start you out with a dressing that's not too strong, but feel free to play around with them. This salad is more of an art than a science.\"",
    "ins": "Place the shredded cabbage in a large bowl, and drizzle olive oil over it. Toss until evenly coated. Season with garlic powder, lemon juice and cilantro, and stir to blend in all of the flavors.",
