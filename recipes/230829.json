    "des": "\"My mom has been making the stew for many years and it is by far the BEST stew I have ever tasted. It is hearty, filling, and inexpensive not to mention extremely delicious and fairly easy to make. The hardest part and the most time-consuming part for this stew is preparing the vegetables. I chop and dice all my vegetables by hand and so it can consume a little bit more time, but it is very much worth the extra time it takes. Pork, beef, or venison are all good in this recipe, too.\"",
    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken in hot oil until completely browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add rutabagas, beets, carrots, celery, and red onion to the pot. Pour enough water over the vegetable mixture to cover completely. Reduce heat to low and cook at a simmer for at least 4 hours, adding water as needed to keep vegetable submerged.",
