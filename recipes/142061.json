    "des": "\"Hearty wheat bread with nutty flavor and lots of good tasting seeds. All the seeds and the Vital Wheat Gluten were available at my local health food store. The Malted Flour was not available. I purchased malted barley seed at the local brewery supply store and ground the seeds to flour in a coffee grinder. The seeds come in various roasts.  I purchased the number 10. The higher numbers become stronger and darker. Malted wheat seeds are also available at the Supply store. I have not made the recipe with the wheat.\"",
    "ins": "Gently stir together the warm water, molasses, honey, and yeast in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Pour oil into the yeast mixture.\nIn a separate bowl mix together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds, 2 tablespoons of millet, barley flour, and vital wheat gluten. Stir the flour and seed mixture to the yeast mixture until it pulls together. Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 7 to 8 minutes, adding additional flour as needed. Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Grease a 9x13 baking sheet.\nPunch down the risen dough and turn out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Form into a round or oval loaf shape and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Cover the dough and allow to rise until doubled in size again, about 40 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C) toward the end of this second rise. Slash the top of the loaf diagonally with a sharp razor blade or serrated knife, carefully brush with the beaten egg white, and sprinkle remaining millet seeds over the top.\nBake in preheated oven until the bread sounds hollow when thumped on the side, 40 to 45 minutes.",
