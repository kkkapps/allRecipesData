    "ins": "In a pot, bring the wild rice and water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes.\nIn a separate pot, melt the butter over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender. Blend in the flour until smooth, and gradually stir in the chicken broth. Stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and mix in the cooked rice, ham, carrots, and almonds. Continue to cook and stir about 5 minutes, until heated through. Thoroughly blend the half and half into the soup just before serving.",
