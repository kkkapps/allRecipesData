    "des": "\"Slightly spicy variation of wonton soup. Cooking the wontons in water rather than broth helps keep the broth clear.  Either fresh or frozen wontons can be used.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, chile-garlic sauce, and salt in a large pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook until hot, about 10 minutes.\nWhile the broth simmers, bring water to a boil in a separate pot. Cook wontons in boiling water until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from water with a slotted spoon and add to the soup.",
