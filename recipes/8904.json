    "des": "\"It is a very delicious West Indian meal which can be eaten with rice, roti,  bread or by itself. It uses garam masala, a blend of dry roasted, ground spices from the colder climes of northern India. 'Garam' is the Indian word for 'warm' or 'hot'; garam masala adds a sense of 'warmth' to both palate and spirit, and can be purchased in Indian markets and in the gourmet section of some supermarkets.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the chicken into a 2 quart covered baking dish or dutch oven with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and olive oil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and appears brown. Add the onion, pepper, garlic, tomato paste, garam masala, curry powder, seasoning to taste and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Mix all together, then add 1/4 cup water for the ingredients to steam.\nReturn to the oven for 5 more minutes to blend all the flavors. Serve over rice or eat plain.",
