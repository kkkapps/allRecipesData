    "des": "\"They're CRUNCHY and CHEWY and SWEET and SALTY and have a touch of CHOCOLATE... the ultimate snack! I get the peanuts and caramels in the bulk food section of the grocery store. It took me a couple of tries to get the caramel right (if you use 2 tablespoons water like some recipes for caramel apples call for, it stays too gooey; if you don't use any water, the caramel gets hard as a rock!)\"",
    "ins": "In a microwave safe dish, combine caramels and water. Microwave for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes or until smooth, stirring after each minute.\nDip a pretzel rod into melted caramel. Reserve about an inch at the end to use as a handle, and spread smooth with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Attach 12 chocolate pieces, then roll in chopped peanuts. Place on wax paper until set.",
