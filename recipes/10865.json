Beat until soft peaks are formed. Fold in the nuts.\nTransfer this all to a large saucepot. Cook over low heat, stirring all the time, until it thickens and turns a little brown, about 10 minutes.\nSpoon the cookies onto greased baking sheets by the teaspoonful, about 1 to 1-1/2 inches apart. Bake about 22 minutes, or until dry. Remove and place on a wire rack to cool.",
