    "des": "\"This is a basic recipe for what the Dutch call 'oliebollen'. We make these type of doughnuts for many celebrations throughout the year. This version has raisins and currants added. Sprinkle with icing sugar to serve. They're delicious warm or cold!\"",
    "ins": "Soak raisins and currants in a bowl of warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels.\nMix 2 tablespoons milk with yeast in a large bowl until dissolved. Add remaining milk, flour, egg, and salt; beat with an electric mixer until dough is smooth. Stir in raisins and currants. Cover dough with a clean dish towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop portions of dough into the hot oil using 2 lightly greased tablespoons or an ice cream scoop. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining dough.",
