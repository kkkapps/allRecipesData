    "ins": "In a large bowl, soak rice in cold water to soak while preparing the rest of the recipe.\nIn a small bowl, using the back of a spoon, smash into a paste the garlic, pepper, salt, curry, and turmeric. Drizzle in the soy sauce as you continue to smash. Set spice aside.\nCut the duck into a dozen pieces, removing the fat and thick skin.\nDrain soaking rice, and set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat, stir in the spice paste, and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in duck pieces; cook about 10 minutes, stirring frequently until lightly browned. Pour in 2 cups water, bring to a boil, and simmer 10 minutes. Pour in remaining water and vegetable oil; return contents to boil. Add rice to pot. Water should cover the rice by 1/2 inch. Return to a boil and cook, covered tightly, 15 to 20 minutes, until rice is tender.\nRemove pot from heat. Let stand, covered, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn out onto serving platter, and garnish with green onions.",
