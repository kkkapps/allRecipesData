    "des": "\"This healthy, protein-packed tofu dish is filled with flavor. This is a spicy dish. I don't find it overly spicy but I like heat in my faux-meat! I served this with wilted garlic spinach and a fresh salad on the side. Remember that tofu is a concentrated protein, so you don't need as much tofu as you would meat. This dish is great reheated! If you want to be really creative, try grilling your tofu for an even more delicious result!\"",
    "ins": "Lay the tofu on a plate lined with a couple sheets of paper towel. Layer more paper towel atop tofu and place another plate atop the stack to press water from the tofu. Let sit at least 5 minutes.\nCut tofu into 1/2-inch strips and put into a large, sealable plastic bag; add soy sauce, chili sauce, ginger, and hoisin sauce. Squeeze bag to remove excess air and seal. Marinate tofu in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nRemove tofu from the marinade, shake to remove excess moisture, and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet. Discard the remaining marinade.\nBake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, flip, and continue baking until firm, 15 to 20 minutes more.",
