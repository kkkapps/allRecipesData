    "ins": "Mix ground beef, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl until evenly blended. Form beef mixture into 6 4-inch wide patties. Transfer patties to a large plate and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until patties are slightly firm, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.\nCook beef patties on preheated grill until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over patties about a minute before they are done.\nMix peanut butter and maple syrup in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat peanut butter mixture in the microwave until slightly runny, about 25 seconds. Stir again.\nSpread peanut butter mixture over hamburger buns and top with beef patties, lettuce, tomatoes, and bacon.",
