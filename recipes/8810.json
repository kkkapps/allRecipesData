    "ins": "Put chicken pieces in a large pot over medium heat, and add enough water to cover 3 inches over the chicken. Add the salt, celery, pepper, carrots, celery and potatoes. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 40 minutes.\nIn a mixing bowl, prepare biscuit mix according to package directions. After simmering soup for 40 minutes, drop rounded tablespoonfuls of the biscuit mixture into the pot and let them cook a bit between additions of dumplings, so that they do not stick together.\nWith a wire whisk, mix together about 1 1/2 cups of water with the flour, then add flour mixture to the soup pot until the broth has the consistency of gravy. Dig in and enjoy the meal!",
