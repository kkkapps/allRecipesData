    "des": "\"These caramel beauties can be shaped while they are cooling, to become edible bowls for exotic desserts.  If left on the parchment to cool, they will become a caramel-colored snowflake of flavor.  Drizzle chocolate on them after cooling for an added bonus.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, corn syrup and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Toss together the flour and pecans and stir into the boiling mixture. Bring the mixture to a second boil before removing from heat. Drop by spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be at least 4 inches apart to allow for spreading.\nBake for 5 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until evenly brown. If molding the cookies into shapes, allow to cool for a minute, until cool enough to handle, but still really hot.",
