    "des": "\"To be totally honest, I didn't think this recipe was going to turn out. I had never added fruit to the ingredients before adding them to my yogurt maker. When I tasted the yogurt, it was really thick, creamy and delicious! And what kid doesn't love bananas? This is a great way to get more fruit into your kid!!\"",
    "ins": "Pour the milk into a pan, and heat over medium heat until small bubbles form around the edge of the pan and milk is just below the boiling point. Do not let the milk boil. Remove from heat and cool. Skim off any skin that forms on the milk.\nPour the cooled milk into a yogurt maker, and stir in the yogurt, vanilla, and bananas. Cook according to manufacturer's directions, or at least 4 hours . If desired, strain yogurt through a fine sieve or coffee filter to remove the whey, and return to the yogurt maker. Refrigerate the yogurt overnight or another 8 hours to thicken further.",
