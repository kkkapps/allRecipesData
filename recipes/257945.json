Once I got an mmmmmmmm out of hubby at breakfast, I knew I had to share. Serve hot with butter and syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Grease a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat.\nCombine banana and egg in a bowl. Mix all-purpose flour, quinoa flour, whole milk, water, sugar, honey, coconut oil, kosher salt, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; add to banana mixture until batter is smooth. Add more water if batter is too thick.\nDrop batter by 1/3 to 1/2 cup onto the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter.",
