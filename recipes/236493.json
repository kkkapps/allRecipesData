    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Run potatoes under cold water until completely chilled; drain. Remove and discard potato peels. Slice potatoes into 1/2-inch rounds.\nPreheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease small casserole dish with oil.\nArrange potatoes into the prepared casserole dish; top with rockfish. Season rockfish and potatoes with pepper.\nMelt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Stir flour, Greek seasoning, paprika, and salt into the butter mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and you have a roux that is beige in color, 5 to 8 minutes.\nWhisk half-and-half into the roux; cook until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir orange juice, lemon juice, and thyme into the half-and-half mixture; whisk over heat until warmed. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to your taste.\nPour the sauce from the skillet over the potatoes and rockfish; top with the chopped orange.\nBake in preheated oven until the fish is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Switch oven to Broil and continue cooking until the top is lightly browned, about 10 minutes more. Cool at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.",
