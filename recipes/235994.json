I like to bake it the night before. This recipe is for 1 deep-dish pie dish or 2 regular pie dishes. Enjoy!\"",

Grease a 9-inch deep-dish pie dish.\nRun beet, carrots, cucumber, celery, spinach, and garlic through juicer according to manufacturer's instructions.

Fold pulp mixture and chicken into egg mixture; pour into the prepared pie dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the quiche comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.",
