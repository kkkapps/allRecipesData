    "des": "\"Your guests will be amazed and delighted when they taste this elegant dessert. Very simple to make too! Also very versatile because you can adapt it to any occasion by virtue of added ingredients -- chopped toasted almonds or pistachios, shaved chocolate, chocolate curls, toasted coconut or maraschino cherries on top.   For Christmas add chopped green and red glaceed cherries between layers and on top.\"",
