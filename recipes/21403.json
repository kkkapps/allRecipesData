It is fabulous even though the ingredients list is quite short!  This is a must make with leftover ham and everyone agrees it's absolutely delicious.\"",

Drain and rinse beans.\nReturn beans to pot and add ham, onion, brown sugar, salt, pepper, cayenne and parsley and  water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until beans are tender. Add more water if necessary during cooking time.",
