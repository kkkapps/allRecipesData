    "des": "\"Quick high protein breakfast. Since this is for breakfast and I'm usually hungry, I will have 2 skillets cooking the crepes at the same time.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk flour, milk, egg whites, olive oil, and cinnamon together in a large bowl until batter is smooth.\nLightly spray a skillet with cooking spray and set over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet and rotate skillet so batter spreads to the edges in a thin layer. Cook until bottom is lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook other side until bottom is lightly browned, about 2 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.\nMix Greek yogurt and jelly together in a bowl. Spoon a layer of yogurt mixture onto each crepe; roll crepe around filling. Place rolled crepes on serving plates and top with remaining yogurt mixture. Sprinkle each crepe with cinnamon.",
