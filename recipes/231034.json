    "des": "\"This sauce is so amazing. I was trying to think of a good sauce without having too much of a tomato taste, and this does it. The mixture of veggies and seasonings does it. To make this more spicy, you can add fresh chiles or hot red peppers crushed. I don't like really hot food, so this was perfect for us. The vinegar makes it have a bit of a bite to it. You can add a bit more or less depending on your taste. Boil 2 pounds noodles; when done, pour sauce over noodles on your plate.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot. Cook sausage links and ground beef in the hot oil until the sausages are cooked through and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Stir mushrooms, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and onion into the meat mixture; cook and stir until he vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.\nRemove sausages from pot to a cutting board to cool slightly; cut into bite-size pieces and return to the pot. Add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, oregano, basil, thyme, kosher salt, black pepper, and marjoram to the pot; stir. Reduce heat to low and cook at a simmer, stirring every so often, for 2 to 3 hours.",
