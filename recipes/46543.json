    "des": "\"These breaded and fried pork cutlets make a traditional Japanese dish which is very simple and easy to make. Serve with sticky rice and tonkatsu sauce and enjoy! Also great if substituted with chicken breasts.\"",
    "ins": "Place the pork chops between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the pork with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness (about .75 cm). Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nPour oil into a skillet about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace the flour, egg, and panko crumbs in separate bowls. Coat each cutlet in flour, then egg, and finally in bread crumbs. Tap off any loose crumbs.\nFry the cutlets until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.",
