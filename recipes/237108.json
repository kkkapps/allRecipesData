    "des": "\"This is a 'dairy' main meal for Passover that re-heats well. Even the pickiest eaters love this recipe. Vegetables like mushrooms, zucchini, and peppers may be added; steam them al dente first and add to layers. Italian cheese blend can be used in place of mozzarella if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat ricotta cheese and eggs together in a bowl.\nBriefly pass each matzah sheet under warm running water; layer moistened sheets on a plate.\nSpread a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a deep 11x15-inch baking dish; top with a layer of moistened matzah sheets, breaking pieces as needed to completely cover marinara. Spread a layer of ricotta mixture over matzah mixture. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over ricotta mixture layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of matzah, marinara, and mozzarella cheese, respectively.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and browned, about 45 minutes.",
