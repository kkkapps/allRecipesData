    "des": "\"This is the most addicting healthy snack in the world! Crunchy, cheesy goodness that is not only vegan but also raw. The cheese is made up of simple natural ingredients like cashews and red bell pepper. This recipe fits perfectly into my busy lifestyle. I just throw them in a bag and take them with me or eat them as an appetizer while I'm preparing dinner. I also sprinkle the leftover cheesy kale flakes on my salad. I love sharing this recipe with friends and family because they instantly fall in love. Now they are making their own and sharing with me! Nom, Nom, crunch, crunch...\"",
