    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a 2-quart baking dish.\nCut off the top of the garlic head to expose the tops of the cloves. Place garlic on a sheet of foil and drizzle with olive oil. Seal the foil around the garlic. Roast until soft, about 25 minutes. Cool. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace potatoes in large pot and cover with water. Set over high heat and bring to a boil. Simmer until the potatoes are fork tender, about 15 minutes. Drain; return to pot.\nPour the Classico(R) Fresh Alfredo sauce, milk, and 4 tablespoons of the melted butter into the pot. Using a hand mixer, mix the potatoes until they no longer have lumps.\nSqueeze the soft roasted garlic into the potatoes; add salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.\nMix the beaten eggs into the potatoes. Reserve a tablespoon of the parsley and chives for topping, and stir the rest into the potatoes. Spread the potato mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nMix the panko with the remaining tablespoon melted butter; sprinkle evenly on top of the potatoes.\nBake until the potatoes are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Garnish with the remaining parsley and chives.",
