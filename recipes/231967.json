    "des": "\"These are perfect for making 3 dozen mini muffins to take to a potluck. Basting the muffin tin with melted butter and dusting with cornmeal are an essential step to getting a marvelous crispy exterior to the muffins. To add more kick,  do not seed the jalapenos and add an extra one.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nWhisk flour, 1 cup cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Mix Cheddar cheese into dry ingredients until coated.\nBeat milk, eggs, vegetable oil, jalapeno peppers, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until well mixed. Make a well in the Cheddar cheese mixture and pour egg mixture into the well; stir just until combined. Batter should be slightly lumpy.\nBrush 18 mini muffin cups with melted butter; spoon about 1 teaspoon cornmeal into each mini muffin cup, tilt pan to coat muffin cups with cornmeal, and tap out the excess. Spoon batter into each muffin cup to about 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 11 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool 5 minutes in the pans before removing to finish cooling.",
