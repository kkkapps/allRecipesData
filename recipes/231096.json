    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nSift flour and baking soda together in a large bowl; cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the mixture and stir in buttermilk until a soft ball forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Roll dough out to a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle.\nCut biscuits out with biscuit cutter and transfer to a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until tops are light brown and sides begin to darken, about 10 minutes. Remove biscuits to cool completely on a wire rack.",
