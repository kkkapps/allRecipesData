    "ins": "Mix the rolled oats and buttermilk together in a large bowl; allow to soak 15 minutes.\nWhisk the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate large bowl.\nBeat the eggs and milk together in a separate small bowl; mix into the soaked oats. Stir the flour mixture into the oat mixture. If the batter seems dry, add milk about 1 tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is achieved.\nGrease a skillet or griddle and place over medium heat. Ladle about 1/2 cup of batter per pancake onto your preheated cooking surface. Cook until the pancake is lightly golden brown, about 2 minutes, flip, and continue cooking to brown other side, another 1-2 minutes.",
