    "des": "\"This warming drink, a treat for coffee and chocolate lovers alike, combines the two under a layer of creamy foamed milk. Skim milk foams easily and makes a deceptively lean, yet rich topping. Enjoy it in the morning, as an afternoon break, and as a lean, luscious, liquid dessert.\"",
    "ins": "In a small mug or coffee cup, mix the cocoa and Sweet'N Low together. Add a few tablespoons of the coffee and stir until the cocoa is completely dissolved. Pour in the remaining coffee.\nFoam the milk. Spoon a generous amount over the hot mocha. Garnish with a pinch of cocoa powder, if desired.",
