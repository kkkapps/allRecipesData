    "ins": "Mix the water and sugar together in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the root beer extract, and allow to cool for about 15 minutes.\nPour the root beer mixture into a 1-gallon pitcher or bottle, and slowly pour in the carbonated water. Refrigerate until cold; serve over ice.",
