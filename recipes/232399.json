    "des": "\"A friend showed this to me years ago, and I added and changed amounts around to fit my taste. This goes great with any pasta dish, steak, or even seafood. If stored in a plastic bag, either open bag and microwave with a cup of water in microwave, or place 1 tablespoon of water in bag to ensure moist bread after heating.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nCut French bread loaf in half lengthwise and spread butter on both cut sides. Sprinkle each side with 2 teaspoons garlic powder. Place halves on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until butter has melted and bread is hot but not toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove bread from oven.\nTurn on oven's broiler.\nSpread half the bottle of blue cheese salad dressing over each half; sprinkle each piece of bread with mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese.\nBroil until mozzarella cheese has melted and is slightly browned, 1 to 4 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Let bread cool 2 to 3 minutes before cutting into serving pieces.",
