    "des": "\"This delicious baked oatmeal is started the day or night before and finished in the morning. It takes a step of extra planning but the reward is better digestion and nutrient absorption. My personal preference is to soak with buckwheat groats and yogurt with no sweetener. I serve it with a large pat of grass-fed butter. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Combine oats, yogurt, and buckwheat flour in a bowl; pour in enough water to cover. Refrigerate oats mixture, 8 to 24 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
