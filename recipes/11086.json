    "des": "\"This recipe is from the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C. Cookies and recipes were handed out at a cultural event that my family attended a few years ago. All Norwegian homes must serve at least 7 kinds of cookies at Christmas. This recipe is different from other pepperkaker recipes on this web site because it calls for cream and does not use eggs. So it's great for any who can't eat eggs. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Cream together the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the cream. Add the baking soda and little water (no more than 2 tablespoons) to the butter mixture.\nSift the spices, baking powder and flour into the butter mixture. Blend until a nice dough is formed. Roll dough into sausages about 2-1/2 inches in diameter wrap tightly and let dough chill thoroughly.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove chilled dough and cut into thin slices. Bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet  for 6 to 8 minutes. Let cookies cool on wire rack.",
