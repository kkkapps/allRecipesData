    "des": "\"Marinate tofu in a mix of rice vinegar, peanut butter, ketchup, garlic, and soy sauce, and discover that tofu really can be tasty! I've tried this recipe by first freezing and defrosting the tofu; it creates a nice texture.\"",
    "ins": "Mix vinegar, ketchup, peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ground ginger, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small, microwave-safe bowl.\nHeat vinegar mixture in microwave oven until the peanut butter is softened, 10 to 15 seconds; stir mixture until smooth.\nPut tofu into a large bowl. Pour sauce over the tofu and stir to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes to a full day, stirring occasionally to assure tofu remains coated in sauce.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSpread tofu onto a baking sheet in a single layer.\nBake in preheated oven until slightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.",
