    "des": "\"I'm a little bit Italian, but I certainly can't say much in Italian. That's okay, because this recipe speaks for me. This was one of those, 'What can I do with what I have in the cupboard?' recipes, partially inspired by trying Cacio e Pepe ('Cheese and Pepper') earlier this year. It turned out great and I think you'll think so too! Serve with your favorite Italian main dish and enjoy!\"",

Stir butter into pea mixture until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium.\nStir Parmesan cheese and black pepper into pea mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until creamy and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.",
