    "des": "\"This is the best cold rhubarb dessert recipe I've found, and it's so easy. I have to give thanks to Nikki for adapting this recipe! Even my son who dislikes rhubarb loves this one. Adapted from the diabetic/diet version (Rhubarb Rumble). I like to make this in an 11x7-inch (2-quart) glass pan, making my own graham cracker crust. The addition of fresh strawberries adds an extra layer of lusciousness. It ends up being a very PRETTY IN PINK dessert. The hard part is waiting for it to chill.\"",
    "ins": "Combine rhubarb and strawberry gelatin mix in a large microwave-safe glass bowl. Cover bowl and cook rhubarb mixture on high until rhubarb is very soft and has cooked down into threads, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir every 2 minutes. Let mixture cool.\nStir skim milk and vanilla pudding mix in a bowl until moistened. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until thickened, about 2 minutes; stir cooled rhubarb mixture into pudding mixture.\nSpread strawberry slices into the bottom of prepared graham cracker crust. Spoon rhubarb pudding mixture over strawberries and refrigerate dessert until firm, about 1 hour.",
