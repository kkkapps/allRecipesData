    "des": "\"Say 'ole!' with this bold and spicy taco dip that includes all of the flavors I remember from my many vacations in Mexico. One thing I will tell you is that this goes perfectly with an icy cold Mexican cerveza (beer) or Margarita! Enjoy with your favorite taco chips.  We especially love the blue corn, and the flavor is perfect with this tasty dip.\"",
    "ins": "Cook the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain the excess grease.\nStir in the garlic, chipotle peppers, cumin, and chili powder; cook just until the flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.\nIn a bowl, mix the cream cheese, red bell pepper, and 2 teaspoons lime juice to make a spreadable mixture. Layer the cream cheese mixture in the bottom of a large springform pan or 9x13-inch baking dish.\nSpread the cooled beef mixture over the cream cheese.\nTop the beef layer with layers of tomato, black olives, Cheddar cheese, half the lettuce, green onion, remaining lettuce, and the taco sauce.\nLightly toss the avocados with juice and zest of 2 limes; spread the avocados over the taco sauce.\nFinish the dip by dotting dollops of sour cream all over the top of the dish and sprinkling with cilantro.",
