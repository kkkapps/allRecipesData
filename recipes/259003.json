    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe in an attempt to use up some pears before they went bad. I really like what I came up with mainly because it's not super complicated and there aren't any other competing flavors with the pears. The other ingredients are delicate and allow the pears to stand out. With all that being said, please note that these measurements are approximations... Enjoy!\"",

Fold pears and pecans gently into flour mixture.\nMix white sugar, milk, brown sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a second bowl. Fold sugar mixture into the flour mixture until batter is blended. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.",
