    "des": "\"This is a wonderful recipe.  This was given to our family years ago by a good friend through the Boy Scouts. My brother would eat it all if he was allowed to and now my children who are both little love this dish. For people on a low budget this is an easy meal to make and it is easy to reheat. My mother, who does not eat chicken, loves the topping of this dish.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).\nIn a 9x13 inch baking dish, layer the chicken breasts, soup and water. Top each breast with a slice of Swiss cheese, then top it all with the breadcrumbs. Cut the butter or margarine into pads and place them over the top of the casserole.\nBake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Let cool and serve.",
