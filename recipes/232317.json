    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix pretzels and sugar together in a bowl; stir in margarine until evenly incorporated. Spoon mixture into a 9-inch pie plate; press into bottom and up sides of plate to form a firm, even crust.\nBake crust in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.\nMix sweetened condensed milk, limeade concentrate, tequila, orange liqueur, and green food coloring in a large bowl.\nBeat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the whipped cream will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into sweetened condensed milk mixture. Spoon filling into cooled crust.\nCover pie with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving; garnish with lime slices.",
