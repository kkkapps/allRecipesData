Cool slightly and remove peels.\nPlace the cooked sweet potatoes into a large bowl and mash with the horseradish, honey, butter and salt. Whip with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, adding heavy cream as needed to get the texture you desire. Serve immediately, or keep warm in the oven until time to serve.",
