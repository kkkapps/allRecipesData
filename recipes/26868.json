    "des": "\"Mom's Sausage Roll is a great appetizer during the holidays or anytime. You may slice it and eat it right out of the oven, or you may serve it cooled. Give it away as gifts during the holidays by packaging the rolls in colored aluminum foil.\"",
    "ins": "Thaw the frozen bread dough.\nPlace sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, rapidly cook and stir the eggs until solid. Remove from heat and set aside.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.\nOne loaf at a time on a lightly floured surface, roll the bread dough into a sheet approximately 1/4 inch or less thick. Spread 1/3 of the sausage, 1/3 of the eggs, 1/3 of the pepperoni and 1/3 of the Provolone cheese evenly over each dough sheet. Roll into a loaf.\nOne at a time, place rolled loaves into the prepared baking dish, brush with 1/3 of the beaten egg mixture and bake in the preheated oven 30 to 45 minutes, until golden brown. If desired, form loaves into a U shape before baking.",
