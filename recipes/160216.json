    "des": "\"This fresh vegetable sauce can be used in place of other sauces, such as traditional spaghetti sauce. It has a sweet fresh taste to it, but is still recognizable as a tomato product. My recommended use is over pasta or with a meat product. In my opinion the sauce is relatively filling and not to be considered a light meal.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, and cook for a few minutes until fragrant, then stir in the dried basil, and cook for a few seconds more. Add the tomatoes, onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper, sugar, and salt. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the red pepper and cucumber. Continue simmering and stirring occasionally until the mixture has reduced to a sauce like consistency, 10 to 15 minutes.",
