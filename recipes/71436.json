    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off grease and season with chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, and salt. Mix in the tomato sauce and 2 cups of the water. Simmer over low heat. Mix the remaining water with the flour and sugar until flour is dissolved; stir into the simmering meat sauce. Simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes.\nWhile the sauce is cooking, heat oil in another skillet over medium-high heat. Warm tortillas in the hot oil until pliable. Fill each tortilla with a little bit of cheese, and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish, reserving some of the cheese to sprinkle on top. Pour the meat sauce evenly over the rolled tortillas. Top with remaining cheese.\nBake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and lightly browned.",
