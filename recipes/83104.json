    "des": "\"This is a VERY simple way to enjoy Middle Eastern flavors in an American format... the hot dog! Serve on a bun or wrapped in a pita. I like adding banana-ketchup, but any condiment will do!  Tahini might be appropriate.  Rice or couscous or an Israeli salad would make a fine side dish. Use ground turkey with a 7% or 8% fat content, as the super lean turkey will be harder to cook with.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.\nIn a small bowl, mix together cumin, coriander, ginger, cinnamon, pepper, and salt.  In a large bowl, crumble the ground turkey; slowly work in seasoning mixture with your hands, distributing seasoning as evenly as possible. Divide into 8 equal balls. On a flat surface, roll out each turkey ball into a tube shape.\nSpray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray, and set it over medium heat. Place turkey tubes into the skillet; cook, turning frequently, until golden brown on all sides. Transfer to a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven about 6 minutes.",
