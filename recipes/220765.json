    "ins": "Cook and stir Italian sausage in a skillet over medium heat, breaking the sausage into crumbles as it cooks, until well browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain excess grease; set sausage aside.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nOil the bottom and sides of a 10-inch springform pan with olive oil.\nCut 1/3 of the dough off the loaf and set aside under a cloth. Form the remaining 2/3 dough into a ball and roll into a 14-inch circle on a floured work surface.\nLine the springform pan with rolled dough, allowing dough to hang over the edge by 2 inches all around.\nLayer half the cooked Italian sausage, half the mozzarella cheese, half the ham, half the provolone cheese, half the salami, and half the pepperoni into the pie crust.\nSpoon and spread half the ricotta cheese over the layers of meat and cheeses.\nSprinkle half the Parmesan cheese over the ricotta.\nPour half the 8 beaten eggs over the layers; continue layering the remaining meats, sliced cheeses, ricotta cheese, and then Parmesan cheese.\nPour remaining beaten eggs over the last layer of Parmesan cheese.\nRoll out remaining piece of bread dough to a circle about 12 inches in diameter; lay the piece over the pie to form the top crust. Roll and pinch the bottom crust overhang over the top crust to seal in the filling.\nBeat 1 egg with water in a small bowl; brush the top of the pie with egg wash.\nBake pie in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set, 50 to 60 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the middle of the crust should come out without raw egg.\nAllow pie to cool in the pan for at least 25 minutes before releasing the spring and removing pie from the pan. Transfer to a serving platter and cut into wedges for serving.",
