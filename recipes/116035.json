    "des": "\"These green beans and potatoes are a spectacular dish.  I have been making them for years in large quantities for special events at my church.  The smoked turkey tails make an excellent broth that is seasoned beyond words.  Let the meat cook until it falls off the bone for the ultimate flavor, at least 2 hours.\"",
    "ins": "Place the turkey tails and onion into a 4 quart Dutch oven and fill half way full with water. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer over low heat until meat falls off the bones, about 2 hours. Remove the bones and skin; return the meat to the pot. Discard bones and skin.\nAdd the green beans to the Dutch oven and simmer for 20 minutes, then add the potatoes. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until they can be easily pierced with a fork.",
