    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil. Add kale and cook uncovered until bright green, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain on paper towels.\nPlace kale, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and chopped garlic in a food processor. Pulse about 5 times; slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup olive oil. Season with salt.\nHeat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the minced garlic and red pepper flakes until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the zucchini and toss until just tender, about 2 minutes.\nRemove the saucepan from heat and add peas and the kale pesto; toss to combine.",
