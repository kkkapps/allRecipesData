    "ins": "Pour the oil into a deep pot or deep skillet, and heat to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and pumpkin pie spice in a mixing bowl.\nBeat the egg, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, and milk together in a large bowl until well blended. Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring until the mixture is smooth.\nUsing your finger to close the opening, pour 1/2 cup batter into a funnel with a 1/2 inch wide spout. Release your finger, and drizzle the batter into the hot oil using a circular motion to make 4 to 6 inch circle, and then cross over the circle to make a spiral pattern. Cook until golden brown. Turn the cake over to cook the bottom side. Use a slotted spoon to remove from the oil, and drain on paper towels. Cool 5 minutes, and dust generously with confectioners' sugar.",
