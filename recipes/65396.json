    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Rinse the turkey inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels. Rub lemon juice all over the turkey and inside the cavity. Set aside.\nMelt 1/4 cup of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook for about 5 minutes, until tender. Add the chopped livers and ground lamb. Cook, stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Stir in the rice, cinnamon, mint and tomato paste. Mix in 1 cup of the water, and season with salt and pepper. Cook over low heat for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.\nFill turkey with the stuffing mixture, and truss. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and pour the remaining 2 cups of water into the pan. Mix together the remaining lemon juice and melted butter. This is the basting sauce.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, then reduce the temperature of the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue roasting for 2 more hours, or until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Baste occasionally with the melted butter and lemon juice.",
