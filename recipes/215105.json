    "des": "\"This healthy dish is tasty and filling. There is a lot of chopping involved in preparation, so you may want to cook the barley and prepare some of the ingredients in advance. It is a complete meal, and the leftovers taste great reheated.\"",
    "ins": "Bring the barley and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the barley is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until the bell pepper is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.\nStir in the cooked barley, tomatoes, zucchini, and kidney beans. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the stove, sprinkle the cheese over the top, replace the cover, and let stand until the cheese melts, about 1 to 2 minutes.",
