Carefully press pieces into muffin cups; set aside.\nCombine apples, remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla in large bowl. Spoon 1/4 cup apple mixture into each crust-lined muffin cup.\nBake 20 minutes. Top each with crumble mixture; bake 8 to 10 minutes more or until crumble browns.
