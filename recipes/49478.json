It's easy to serve. Spoon it up into a cup and eat it in the car, camper, or in our case, a motel room! That's why we call it Evacuation Tuna & Pasta Salad.\"",

Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and cool.\nIn a large bowl, combine pasta, eggs, tuna Cheddar cheese, celery, onion, roasted red pepper, and lima beans.
