    "des": "\"A fantastic recipe with a touch of HOT for chicken or turkey. Use caution when handling the jalapeno peppers. Uncle Bill's Tips:  Wear plastic gloves or wash hands thoroughly after handling, using white vinegar or a mixture of water and bleach to remove the pepper's heat.\"",

Reduce heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes; stirring occasionally.\nStir lemon juice and sherry into the mixture until blended.
