    "des": "\"Quinoa is a high-protein, good-for-you grain. It can be substituted for couscous and makes a lovely side dish. This recipe is a crunchy, lemony, healthy dish that can be used as a side or as a light meal.\"",
    "ins": "Toast the pine nuts briefly in a dry skillet over medium heat. This will take about 5 minutes, and stir constantly as they will burn easily. Set aside to cool.\nIn a saucepan, combine the quinoa, water and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly, then fluff with a fork.\nTransfer the quinoa to a serving bowl and stir in the pine nuts, lemon juice, celery, onion, cayenne pepper, cumin and parsley. Adjust salt and pepper if needed before serving.",
