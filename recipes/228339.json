    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nSpread cashews onto a baking sheet.\nToast cashews in preheated oven until browned, about 5 minutes.\nPour sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat while the cashews are toasting; cook and stir until melted. As soon as it is melted and the nuts are done toasting, pour the nuts in the saucepan; stir to coat. Spread cashews onto baking sheet to cool completely, about 15 minutes.\nMassage kale and soy sauce together in a bowl until kale softens. Fold raisins and sugar-coated cashews into the kale.\nRefrigerate 30 minutes before serving.",
