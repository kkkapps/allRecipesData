    "des": "\"Growing up along the Eastern seaboard in Rhode Island, seafood is a staple of the  state! This is a wonderful recipe that is prepared right on the beach!! A lot of work, but well worth it! You'll have to collect a lot of stones and seaweed for this dish.\"",
    "ins": "At the beach dig a hole in the sand with the approximate proportions: width = 2 feet, length = 4 feet, depth = 1-1/2 feet.  Line the hole with stones from the beach.  Build a fire inside of the hole and cover with rocks from the beach. Heat the stones for 2 to 3 hours.\nRemove coals and/or embers from the hole. Arrange hot stones evenly across the bottom of the hole. Place fresh 1/2 bushel seaweed (wet) on top of the hot stones.\nWorking quickly layer the food on top of the seaweed, the food should be layered evenly on top of each other in the following order: clams, mussels, fish, sausage,  hotdogs (wrapped in cheesecloth), onions, potatoes (white and sweet), corn, and finally lobsters.\nCover food with a clean, wet cloth.  Place remaining seaweed on top of cloth.\nCover entire hole of food with a wet tarpaulin, sealing the steam created by the hot stones and seaweed in. Allow a very small amount of steam to escape to relieve pressure. Let bake cook for 1 or more hours.  The bake is completed when the potatoes are soft. Serve bake with melted butter to dip the seafood in and lobster crackers. Don't forget napkins -- you'll need 'em!",
