    "des": "\"Quick and easy with few ingredients. Great for an on-the-fly marinade. Tangy Italian dressing and Worcestershire are used to accentuate the natural flavor of the cut, while the minced garlic provides a delectable rich flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Score the steaks lightly on both sides using a sharp knife. Place in a shallow baking dish. Pour the Italian dressing and Worcestershire sauce over them, and sprinkle with garlic. Rub the marinade into the steaks using the back of a spoon or fork. Turn steaks over, and repeat on the other side. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 24 hours.\nPreheat a grill to medium-high heat. Oil the grate lightly with a paper towel dipped in olive oil.\nGrill steaks for about 6 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.",
