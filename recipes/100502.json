    "des": "\"Soda bread dough is flattened into a round circle, and divided into farls meaning 4 parts. It is then cooked on a dry griddle or pan. Traditionally this was the quickest way to make soda bread for unexpected guests who drop by for a bit of craic (good fun). It's best eaten fresh with butter and jam but is also delicious fried as part of an Ulster breakfast.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat heavy based flat griddle or skillet on medium to low heat.\nPlace flour and salt in a bowl and sift in baking soda.  Make a well in the center, and pour in the buttermilk.\nWork quickly to mix into dough and knead very lightly on a well floured surface. Form into a flattened circle, about 1/2 inch thick and cut into quarters with a floured knife.\nSprinkle a little flour over the base of the hot pan and cook the farls for 6 to 8 minutes on each side or until golden brown.",
