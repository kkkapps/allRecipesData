    "des": "\"I adapted this from a korokke recipe I frequently use. Korokke is a Japanese fried croquette made with seasoned ground meat and mashed potato. I combined the seasoning used there with a standard meatloaf recipe to create this fun hybrid. I serve it with mashed potatoes and a spicy barbeque sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat corn oil and sesame oil in a large skillet. Add carrots, green bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar, and fish soup stock. Mix in garlic and ginger. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMix turkey, pork, and eggs together in a large bowl until blended. Stir in cooled carrot mixture and bread crumbs until well combined. Press evenly into a loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); continue baking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes more.\nLet stand before serving, about 5 minutes.",
