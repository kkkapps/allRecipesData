    "des": "\"A boyfriend's mother taught me this great dipping sauce for artichokes and asparagus. It's somewhat like aioli. Replace dried basil for fresh, and garlic salt for the garlic. If you do use dried basil, cut the original amount in half. Use low-fat mayonnaise if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the mayonnaise and garlic together in a small bowl. Add the lemon juice and basil; whisk until thoroughly combined. Beat the Worcestershire sauce into the mixture. Serve immediately, or chill until serving.",
