Wrap in waxed paper; refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours or up to 1 week.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Unwrap chilled rolls and cut into 1/4 inch thick slices. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned. Remove from baking sheets immediately to cool on wire racks.",
