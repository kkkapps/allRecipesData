    "des": "\"This recipe is the result of my desire to lighten one of my favorite comfort foods: potato soup. Cauliflower adds bulk and nutrition while the potato keeps the strong flavor of the cauliflower from overwhelming the dish.\"",
    "ins": "Stir cauliflower, chicken broth, water, and potatoes together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and stir in garlic, salt, white pepper, and thyme. Cover pot and simmer until potatoes and cauliflower are soft, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMash potato and cauliflower mixture using an immersion blender or potato masher until pureed.\nBring pureed soup to a simmer; cook until consistency is smooth and flavors are blended, about 30 minutes. Adjust salt, pepper, and thyme to taste.",
