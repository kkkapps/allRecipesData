Set aside to cool completely.\nFor the filling, in the bowl of your stand mixer or with a hand mixer, slowly beat the soft cream cheese, marshmallow fluff and peppermint extract.  Be careful to scrape down the sides of your mixing bowl. When the batter is completely smooth, slowly add the heavy whipping cream until it's just incorporated. Fold the instant pudding, salt and red food coloring into the mixture gently with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle 1/2 of the crush candies into the smooth filling.\nSpread the filling into the baked crust and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Add a drizzle of hot fudge, a spoon of fresh whipped cream and sprinkle of crushed candies to the top before serving.\nRelease the cheesecake from the pan and serve!  A tart pan or pie plate are acceptable for use as well.",
