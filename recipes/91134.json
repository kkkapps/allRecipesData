    "des": "\"These awesome muffins are light and spongy. I used only organic products. The applesauce and coconut add great flavor and sweetness while cutting the use of oil and sugar. They're great to make during the fall when pumpkins are everywhere, but they are excellent anytime. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour muffin pans or use paper liners.\nWhisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, oil, applesauce, and sugar in a bowl. Combine the all-purpose flour, pastry flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Slowly add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture, whisking continually. Fold in the coconut and chocolate chips. Pour the resulting batter into the muffin pans.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before serving, about 1 hour.",
