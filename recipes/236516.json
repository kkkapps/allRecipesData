Mash yolks with a fork; stir mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, dry mustard, and cayenne pepper into yolks until smooth; season with salt. Spoon yolk mixture into a resealable plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag.\nPlace egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Pipe the yolk mixture into egg white halves; sprinkle with smoked paprika. Refrigerate deviled eggs, covered, until ready to serve.",
