    "des": "\"The story of this recipe is that I broke a compact fluorescent light bulb, which has a high mercury content, and I was looking into ways to detox or prevent mercury poisoning symptoms. The cilantro and garlic help to detox mercury, the Brazil nuts replace your selenium stores, and the flax seeds add fiber to work everything through your system. I got all the ingredients together and figured out a delicious way to eat it all! I chop up tomatoes and spoon the pesto mixture over bread or crackers to make a bruschetta.\"",
