    "des": "\"I got this recipe from my ex-wife's mother. People absolutely beg her to make this for family dinners and potlucks. It's so simple, she'll often just give them the recipe. The only thing bad about this recipe is there are never any leftovers. You can use as much or as little cheese as you like, but we like to cover the entire thing with a healthy layer of cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir water, butter, minced onion, parsley, salt, and thyme together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in milk. Mix in potato flakes, add sour cream, and beat until fluffy. Pour potato mixture into a casserole dish and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.\nBake until cheese is melted and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes.",
