Thanks to things like fruitcakes so dense they have their own gravitational fields, making edible gifts has gotten a bad name, but that's not an issue with this chipotle oil, especially if that certain someone on your gift list likes the spicy stuff!\"",

Pour oil over chipotle; whisk until chipotle is dissolved. Cover bowl with aluminum foil and seal tightly. Leave for a week, stirring once per day.\nPour chipotle oil through a fine mesh strainer into a bottle or glass container.",
