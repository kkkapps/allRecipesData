    "ins": "Wash and pat dry the strawberries with paper towels, leaving the green caps and stems intact.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper, and set aside. Place the finely chopped peanuts in a bowl, and set aside.\nHeat the frosting in the microwave until warm and melted, 20 to 40 seconds. Hold each strawberry by the green top, and dip it straight down into the warm frosting, coating about 3/4 of the berry.\nGently roll the dipped strawberry in chopped peanuts, and place on the lined baking sheet to set up. Serve as soon as they have set.",
