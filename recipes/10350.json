    "des": "\"This recipe is from my grandmother: the secret is to roll the dough thin for a light, crisp cookie.  Polish bow tie cookies.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, beat together the egg yolks, sour cream, white sugar, vanilla and whiskey until smooth. Stir in flour until dough is stiff enough to knead. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Knead in additional flour if necessary. Divide dough into 3 or 4 pieces and roll each ball on floured surface.  Cut into strips about 3 inches long then make a slit long ways down the middle.  Pull one of the ends through like a bow.\nPlace into hot oil and deep fry until golden  brown.  Let drain on paper towels and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.",
