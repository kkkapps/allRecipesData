    "des": "\"I created this recipe by combining a very light and tasty fish with an egg and crumb coating, adapted from the way that I used to fry the fish I caught from the lake as a kid in northern WI.\"",
    "ins": "Spread crushed crackers onto a plate. Pour eggs into a shallow dish.\nPlace fish in a 1-gallon plastic bag and add flour; gently shake until completely coated.\nHeat oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.\nDip each flour-coated piece of fish in the egg, allowing excess to drip back into dish. Press coated fish in the cracker crumbs until evenly coated.\nFry fish in the hot oil until lightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes per side. Season fish with dill and salt.",
