    "des": "\"This pasta dish is both fresh and hearty! The fresh taste of summer from the zucchini and tomatoes contrasts nicely with the earthy saltiness of the anchovies.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nMeanwhile, stir together the anchovies and their oil with the red pepper flakes and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking up the anchovies as you stir. Once the garlic begins to sizzle, add the sliced zucchini, and cook until it begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the grape tomatoes, and continue cooking until the zucchini is tender, and the skins of the tomatoes begin to pop, 5 minutes more.\nSprinkle the vegetable mixture with oregano and basil, then stir in shrimp. Cook until the shrimp turn pink and are no longer translucent. Pour over bucatini to serve.",
