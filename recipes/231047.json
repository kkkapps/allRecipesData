    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBeat butter and sugar together in a bowl until mixture is creamy. Beat in eggs, orange zest, orange extract, and almond extract.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; mix dry ingredients into moist ingredients to make a stiff dough. Mix sweetened cranberries into dough. Form dough into a ball, cut into halves, and shape each half into a log. Place logs onto prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Let logs cool completely on wire racks.\nCut logs into slices on a slight diagonal and lay the slices on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake biscotti until crisp and lightly golden brown, about 7 minutes.",
