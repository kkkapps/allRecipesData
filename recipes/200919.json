    "des": "\"This is a summer favorite at my house. So easy and tasty, and complements steak, ribs, chicken or fish. By the way, these can be done in the oven under the broiler as well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCut the zucchini in half crosswise, then slice each half into 3 slices lengthwise, making 6 slices per zucchini.\nMix the butter, garlic, and parsley in a bowl, and spread the mixture on both sides of each zucchini slice. Sprinkle one side of each slice with Parmesan cheese, and place the slices, cheese sides up, crosswise on the preheated grill to keep them from falling through.\nGrill the zucchini until the cheese has melted and the slices are cooked through and show grill marks, about 8 minutes.",
