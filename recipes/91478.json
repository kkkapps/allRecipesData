    "des": "\"A fun way to make canned tuna taste less like canned tuna. These thin tuna patties are tasty enough to be eaten plain or in a pita pocket with lettuce and tomato.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, stir together the tuna, egg and oats until blended. Mix in the barbeque sauce, green onion, hot pepper sauce, savory, and salt.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Spoon tablespoonfuls of the tuna mixture into the pan, and flatten slightly. Smaller patties hold together better. Cook until browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side.",
