    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray and sprinkle with 1 pinch thyme.\nPlace chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4-inch.\nSpread apples and Cheddar cheese evenly over each chicken breast. Starting at one end, roll each breast around filling and secure the roll with a toothpick through the center. Transfer breasts to prepared baking dish. Drizzle olive oil over each breast and sprinkle with remaining thyme.\nCook chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
