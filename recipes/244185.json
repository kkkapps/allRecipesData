    "des": "\"The use of whole beans creates an almost-white coffee ice cream, with all the robust flavor of freshly brewed coffee.  The oil from the beans seeps into the cream and the result is almost like a 'coffee cream tea' that turns into smooth, rich ice cream.\n\n Serve this ice cream in cold-brewed coffee for a delicious coffee-coffee float on hot days.\"",
    "ins": "Place the bowl of ice cream maker in the freezer.\nCombine cream, sugar, and egg yolks in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium-low heat until mixture is heated through but not boiling, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and add coffee beans. Transfer cream mixture to a bowl and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nStrain coffee beans out of cream mixture. Stir milk, vanilla extract, and salt into cream mixture; transfer to bowl of ice cream maker.\nProcess cream mixture in the ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.",
