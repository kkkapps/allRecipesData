    "ins": "Prepare the cake mix as directed by the manufacturer. Bake in a 9x13 inch pan, or two 8 inch round pans. When the cake is cool, split in half, horizontally. Prepare the vanilla pudding according to package directions.\nCrumble half of the cake into the bottom of the punch bowl. Then put a layer of 1/3 of the whipped topping, a layer of 1/2 of the pudding, then a layer of 1/2 the can of pineapple. Repeat the layers in the same amounts, and top with the remaining whipped topping. Keep refrigerated until serving.",
