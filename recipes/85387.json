    "des": "\"These muffins are delicious -- they are my uncle's recipe. Since I was born until I was ten or eleven I would have one of these muffins with breakfast every morning. They have just the perfect amount of everything, light and sweet. Then I learned to bake them myself and have been ever since. It's also a good way to use up bananas that are somewhat past their best days.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 24 muffin cups.\nIn a bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and vanilla. Mix in banana and sour cream. Stir in the eggs. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix dry ingredients into the banana mixture until evenly moist. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer batter to the prepared muffin cups, filling each cup about 3/4 full.\nBake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.",
