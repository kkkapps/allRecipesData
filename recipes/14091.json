    "des": "\"A great way to use up some of the extra kale you might have in your garden! You can use other similar greens in this recipe - spinach, mustard greens, and arugula will all work.  A mixture of greens is also quite good.  Serve as a salad, as a side dish, or as a main dish with rice.\"",
