    "ins": "Place chicken breasts in a pot; cover with 1 inch water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 10 to 14 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nDrain chicken and cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Cut into small cubes.\nPlace chicken cubes in a blender; blend until easily scooped with a tablespoon.\nLay wonton wrappers on a flat work surface. Brush 1 teaspoon tzatziki sauce over the center of each wrapper. Top with 1 teaspoon chicken and 1 teaspoon feta cheese. Fold over and seal edges.\nWhisk egg and water together in a small bowl. Brush over top of wontons.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry wontons in batches until golden brown, about 2 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.",
