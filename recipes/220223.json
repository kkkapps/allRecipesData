    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLine a baking sheet with foil.\nPlace chicken breasts on the baking sheet and sprinkle with 3/4 of the ranch dressing packet.\nBake chicken in the preheated oven until lightly browned and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nRemove from oven and spoon Cheddar cheese soup over the chicken breasts. Sprinkle with remaining ranch dressing mix.\nPlace asparagus spears on the chicken breasts.\nTop each chicken breast with a slice of Swiss cheese.\nReturn chicken to oven and bake until the asparagus is slightly tender and the cheese is hot, about 15 more minutes.",
