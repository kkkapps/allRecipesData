    "des": "\"My husband is from Denmark, and making this traditional Danish favorite is a family affair. I make the batter, my husband does the cooking, and the kids help us make them disappear! We like to dip our aebleskivers in raspberry jam, maple syrup, and powdered sugar. The cardamom gives them that something extra. No wonder this recipe is a family favorite! Danish cooks use a long knitting needle to turn the doughnuts, but you can use a fork, too.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an electric aebleskiver pan according to the manufacturer's directions.\nBeat together the eggs, buttermilk, and butter in a mixing bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk the flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, and cardamom into the egg mixture until evenly blended and smooth.\nSpoon 1 tablespoon of shortening into each cup of the preheated aebleskiver pan, and allow the oil to heat. Pour batter into each cup until 3/4 full. Allow the batter to cook in  the bottom of the cup 3 to 4 minutes until golden brown, then use a long skewer or knitting needle to lift one edge and give it a 1/4 turn. The uncooked batter will spill over into the cup, and cook. Continue lifting and turning the edges until the batter is fully cooked into a golden brown ball. Drain on paper towels.",
