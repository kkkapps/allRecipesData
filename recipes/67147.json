    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nHeat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over a medium heat. Stir in pine nuts, and cook until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels. Place shallots in the skillet. Cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in garlic and sun-dried tomatoes, and cook 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, mix in pine nuts, bread crumbs, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, and set aside to cool.\nSlice the tenderloin lengthwise across the top about 2/3 of the way through the meat to create a pocket. Spread stuffing into the pocket. Wrap the tenderloin with kitchen twine to secure the stuffing, and transfer to a roasting pan. Rub the remaining olive oil over the surface of the meat. Season with salt and pepper.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue cooking tenderloin 20 minutes, or to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from oven and let the meat rest for 15 minutes before serving.",
