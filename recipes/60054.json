    "des": "\"This quick and easy salsa can be made in just a few minutes with a food processor. Green onions instead of white onions give it a nice, mellow flavor to balance the kick of the jalapenos. This recipe also works well with 2-3 habanero peppers instead of the jalapenos.  But be sure to remove the seeds and membrane from the habaneros first! Grab a bag of tortilla chips, dip, eat, and enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "In a food processor, finely chop the cilantro, garlic, and jalapenos. Place the tomatoes and cumin in the food processor. Coarsely chop the tomatoes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Mix in the green onions, lime juice, and olive oil.",
