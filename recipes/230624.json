Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nCombine ground beef, ground pork, ground veal, eggs, bread crumbs, pale ale, onion, 3 tablespoons ketchup, mustard, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. Transfer mixture to prepared baking sheet; shape into 10x5x2-inch loaf. Spread 1/3 cup ketchup on top of the loaf.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 60 to 65 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cool meatloaf 10 minutes before slicing.",
