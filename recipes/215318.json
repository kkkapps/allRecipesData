    "ins": "Season the beef with salt and black pepper; heat the margarine in a skillet over low heat, and cook the beef, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned and tender, about 45 minutes.\nWhile the beef is cooking, place the tomato soup, corn, peas, beans, spinach, beef bouillon cubes, water, garlic powder, and garlic herb seasoning in a large, heavy saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, then add the stew beef. Simmer to blend the flavors, about 30 minutes.\nCut each biscuit into quarters, flatten slightly, and gently stir the dumplings into the stew. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, then cover the stew and simmer 10 more minutes.",
