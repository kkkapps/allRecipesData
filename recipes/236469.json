Place 1 tablespoon almond mixture in the lower center of each piece. Fold top of puff pastry down over the filling and press edges together to seal. Make three 1/2-inch cuts equal lengths apart on the bottom edge to make the \"claws\". Transfer pastries to a baking sheet.\nWhisk egg and water together in a bowl. Brush each bear claw with egg mixture and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons superfine sugar and sliced almonds.\nBake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.",
