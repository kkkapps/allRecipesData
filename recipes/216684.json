Set the fries aside.\nPreheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).\nPlace the bread on a baking sheet, and toast to a light brown in the preheated oven, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove half the bread slices. Place 1/4 of the pastrami on the remaining 4 bread slices, and top with provolone cheese. Return to the oven until the pastrami is hot and the cheese is melted, about 5 more minutes.\nTo assemble, top the melted cheese of each sandwich with French fries, cole slaw, 2 tomato slices, and the top pieces of bread.",
