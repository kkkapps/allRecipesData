    "ins": "Mix honey, Worcestershire sauce, vegetable oil, lemon juice, and salt in a bowl, stirring until salt has dissolved. Place chicken into marinade, turn chicken pieces over to coat, and cover bowl. Marinate chicken in refrigerator for 24 hours, turning once.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with aluminum foil and spray foil with cooking spray.\nMix corn flake crumbs with walnuts and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a shallow bowl. Remove chicken pieces from marinade, discarding the used marinade, and press into crumb mixture to coat. Arrange chicken into prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink inside, the juices run clear, and chicken is browned, about 1 hour. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece of chicken should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
