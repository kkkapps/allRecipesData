    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nMix sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well blended. Add dulce de leche; stir until evenly distributed in the sugar mixture. Stir in apples until evenly coated.\nRoll out pie crusts on a lightly floured work surface. Line a 9-inch pie plate with 1 crust. Pour in apple filling, heaping it in the middle. Cover with second crust. Pinch edges together to seal. Cut several slits into the top with a sharp knife.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until apples are hot and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes more.",
