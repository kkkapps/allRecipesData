    "ins": "Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the paneer in the hot oil until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove the paneer to a plate lined with paper towels, reserving the oil in the skillet.\nAdd 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Fry the onions, bell peppers, ginger, and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are browned, about 5 minutes. Season with the garam masala, turmeric, and fennel; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir the tomatoes, ketchup, and salt into the mixture; continue cooking until the tomatoes are tender and the oil separates from the gravy. Pour the water into the skillet and stir. Return the paneer to the skillet; raise heat to high and cook until the gravy is thick, about 10 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.",
