    "des": "\"S'mores indoors have all the flavors and textures of fire-roasted s'mores but can be prepared indoors any time of the year! Kids and adults are going to love these slightly elevated summer campfire favorites. I used semisweet chocolate chips, but this recipe will work with milk chocolate and white chocolate chips as well.\"",
    "ins": "Grease 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.\nStir graham cracker crumbs and 2 tablespoons coconut oil together in a bowl. Press cracker mixture into the bottoms of the prepared muffin cups.\nCombine chocolate chips and remaining coconut oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl; melt in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes (depending on your microwave). Divide melted chocolate mixture evenly among muffin cups.\nPress 1 marshmallow horizontally into chocolate in each muffin cup; refrigerate until chocolate is firm, 1 to 2 hours.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nBake s'mores in the preheated oven until marshmallows are browned and puffed, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Return muffin tin to refrigerator to set chocolate and marshmallow, 30 to 60 seconds. Loosen and remove s'mores from the muffin cups with a butter knife.",
