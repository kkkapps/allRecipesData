    "des": "\"My wife had a craving for ham and potatoes and we had several items we wanted to use up. We didn't cook the celery with the onion and green pepper to add some additional crunch, but they could be cooked together.  We used reduced-fat ingredients throughout and had great success.  We found that there were no spices needed as the vegetables were a great flavor combination! This recipe ended up being a winner with everyone in the family!\"",
