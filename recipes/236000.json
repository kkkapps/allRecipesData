    "des": "\"This is a healthy and simple soup I whipped up for the Vitamix\u00c2\u00ae. Can easily be made vegetarian or vegan by substituting vegetable broth and/or non-dairy milk. You can reserve some of the microwaved broccoli and potatoes and add them after blending if you like more substance to your soup. Enjoy!\"",
