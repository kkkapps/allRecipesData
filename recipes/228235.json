    "ins": "Place bread dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and allow dough to rise in a warm location until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours. Punch down dough and roll each loaf into a 12x15-inch rectangle.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef, garlic powder, oregano, parsley, salt, and black pepper until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.\nSprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over bread dough. Spread about half the tomato sauce over the mozzarella cheese.\nLayer the seasoned ground beef, provolone cheese, salami, pepperoni, and coppa ham on top and spread remaining half of the tomato sauce over the meat. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and Romano cheese over tomato sauce.\nRoll each portion into a log, beginning with the long side. Press and seal the seam and ends of each roll; arrange rolls seam-side down on prepared baking sheets. Brush with egg yolk.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before slicing. Serve warm.",
