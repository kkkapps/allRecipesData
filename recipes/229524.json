    "des": "\"This is something my grandmother used to make, but she never used a recipe. It took me a long time to figure out just what she did. I think this is as close to hers as it gets. It's just a simple rice side dish, but if you add a pound of cooked ground beef or chicken you can serve it as a meal. I hope you enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir rice, onion, and bell pepper in hot oil until the vegetables are slightly tender and rice is lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.\nStir diced tomatoes, vegetable juice, tomato sauce, water, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper into the rice mixture. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes more.",
