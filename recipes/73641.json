    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCrumble the ground pork into a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and water. Cook, stirring frequently, until evenly browned. Remove from heat, and mix in the fresh bread crumbs. Season with salt, cinnamon, and cloves, and mix well.\nPress one of the pie crusts into the bottom and up the sides of a pie plate. Fill with the pork mixture. Place the second crust over the top, and pinch the seams to seal. Poke a couple of holes in the top crust to vent steam.\nBake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crust is golden.",
