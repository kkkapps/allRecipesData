    "des": "\"My grandmother made these cookies every year for Christmas; they are like an Italian chocolate chip cookie.  In fact, you can use chocolate chips instead of the raisins, if you wish.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn  a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar. Stir in the eggs until everything is well blended. Stir in the baking soda , then gradually add the flour until the dough is thick. This may not require all 5 cups. Finally, stir in the walnuts and raisins. Drop by tablespoons onto unprepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on the baking sheets.",
