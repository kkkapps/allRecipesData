    "des": "\"I developed this recipe as a last-minute alternative to traditional cold bean salad.  It's not overly spicy, and it went over well with both kids and adults.  For those who love curry, this is an easy way to add a perked-up vegetable to a summertime menu. Lemon juice can be used in place of rice vinegar. Can be served immediately or refrigerated to blend flavors. For faster preparation, substitute dried versions of any of the flavorings (adjusting the amounts).\"",
    "ins": "Mix onion, curry powder, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger together in a large bowl. Stir oil into the onion mixture; season with salt and black pepper; mix well. Add green beans and almonds to the mixture; toss lightly to coat.",
