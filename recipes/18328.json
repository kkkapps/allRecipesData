    "des": "\"A great side dish. You can substitute baby Yukon Gold potatoes for the regular ones; adjust cooking time accordingly.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover by several inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, add 1 tablespoon salt, and reduce to a gentle boil. Cook until potatoes are just tender when pierced with a knife. Do not overcook. Drain, cool, and transfer to a bowl.\nWhile the potatoes cook, combine the vinegar, sugar, and remaining salt in a small saucepan and place over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Drizzle over the potatoes, and gently toss to coat.\nSaute bacon in a large skillet placed over medium-low heat, stirring frequently until browned and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Drain excess fat from skillet, leaving a thin coat of bacon grease in skillet.\nSaute onions in skillet with the reserved bacon grease until translucent but not browned. Pour in the beef broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until reduced by half; about 20 minutes. Pour the broth mixture over the potatoes, and sprinkle with the bacon and chopped parsley. Gently stir, and serve immediately.",
