    "des": "\"Great snack or side dish to a healthy (baked not fried) meal.  First time I made these, it was sort of an experiment; but apparently it was a successful one, because these fries disappeared in no time! Perfect on their own or with your favorite potato dip. Can be made on the grill as well and make a great side for a summer barbecue!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray.\nPlace whole potatoes into a covered dish; cook in microwave on High for 4 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before cutting each potato into 8 to 10 wedges.\nPlace the potato wedges in a large bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and toss until evenly coated. Spread the wedges in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBake the potatoes in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Spray the wedges with the cooking spray, turn, and spray again with the cooking spray. Continue baking until golden brown, about 12 minutes more.\nStir the rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, oregano, parsley, sage, pepper, and salt together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the potato wedges. Serve hot.",
