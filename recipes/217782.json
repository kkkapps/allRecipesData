    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix together the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, black pepper, salt, seafood seasoning, and  parsley in a shallow bowl. Beat the eggs in a separate shallow bowl.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip fish fillets in the egg, then the crumbs; brush off any loose crumb mix. Sprinkle fillets with paprika, and cook in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the fish fillets to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cook and stir the onions and green bell peppers in the hot skillet until the onions are tender and translucent, about 10 minutes; spoon away any excess oil, and stir in the tomatoes. Bring the vegetables to a boil, and spread them over the fish. Cover the dish with foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 30 minutes; remove foil, and spread Monterey Jack cheese over the fish and vegetables. Return to oven, and bake until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 more minutes.",
