    "des": "\"My family loves these oatmeal cookies, and with my made-over version, they are a great way to sneak extra fiber and grains into their diet! I reduce the sugar, add whole wheat, use rolled oats and add dates (for extra fiber!)\"",
    "ins": "Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture. Fold in oats and dates. Cover and chill dough for at least one hour.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.\nRoll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten each cookie with a large fork.\nBake in preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
