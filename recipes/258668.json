    "des": "\"This is our personal twist on the cobb salad. We cook the chicken in teriyaki sauce for a surprisingly good flavor combination.\"",
    "ins": "Cook bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and let cool.\nCook and stir chicken and teriyaki sauce in the same skillet until chicken no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let cool, about 15 minutes.\nWhisk blue cheese dressing with milk in a large bowl to a consistency that will toss well with the salad. Add bacon, teriyaki chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocados. Toss thoroughly until salad is evenly mixed.",
