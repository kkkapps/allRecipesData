    "des": "\"A delicious deviation from the typical squash preparation, this recipe has kind of a nutty flavor with or without the nuts. Good as-is, but of course each person can salt and pepper their own serving to taste. The leftovers are good served as a cold salad if you don't like the cooked spinach that results from re-heating. Almonds and walnuts can be used in addition to or instead of the pecans.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nSlice butternut squash cross-wise into 1-inch slices; peel and clean each slice, removing and discarding seeds and stringy pulp from the center. Cut cleaned slices into 1-inch cubes.\nToss squash cubes, onion, and olive oil together in a bowl until coated; transfer to the prepared baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven until squash is tender and starting to brown, 25 to 30 minutes.\nToss squash mixture, spinach, dried cranberries, and pecans together in a serving bowl and serve warm.",
