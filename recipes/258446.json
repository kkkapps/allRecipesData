    "des": "\"Simple chili prepared in a Dutch oven, then served over a bag of Fritos\u00c2\u00ae or other chips with loads of toppings (like sharp Cheddar cheese, scallions, diced onion, sour cream, and avocado). Perfect for picnics, block parties, camp-outs and game nights. You can simply pour out the Fritos into a serving dish and top with the accompaniments or--if you wish to be truly authentic, and I think you do-- serve the Frito pie directly in the Frito bag.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season beef chuck and pork shoulder generously with salt. Cook in the hot oil in batches until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch.\nStir onions, jalapeno chile pepper, and garlic into the Dutch oven; cook until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, orange juice, lime juice, chili powder, lime zest, cumin, and oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover partially with the lid, and simmer until beef and pork fall apart when pressed, about 3 hours.\nDivide corn chips among serving bowls. Spoon chili on top. Garnish each serving with cotija cheese, pickled jalapeno peppers, limes, and cilantro.",
