    "ins": "In a mixing bowl combine cornmeal, cold water and salt. Grease a loaf pan.\nBring the remaining 3 cups of water to a rolling boil and stir in the cornmeal mixture. Bring the mixture back to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to a simmer and stir in the cheese.\nLet the mixture simmer for 20 to 30 minutes; stirring frequently. Allow the polenta to simmer until it becomes very thick. Spread the mixture into the loaf pan and refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.",
