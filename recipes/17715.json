    "des": "\"This is my absolute favorite marinade for chicken. I could eat this every night! The longer you let it marinate, the more intense the flavor. I usually let it sit overnight in the refrigerator, but a few hours will do.\"",
    "ins": "In a large, resealable plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, wine, lemon juice, oil, Italian-style seasoning, ginger, garlic, onion powder, and ground black pepper. Place chicken in the bag. Seal, and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.\nThread the chicken onto skewers, and set aside. Pour marinade into a small saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat.\nLightly oil the grill grate. Cook chicken on the prepared grill for approximately 8 minutes per side, basting with the sauce several times. Chicken is done when juices run clear.",
