    "des": "\"Baby bok choy have a milder taste than the full-grown deal and are also more tender. I just cook them in some chicken broth and garlic, and serve them with rice and fish. My family enjoys the taste of garlic, so we use quite a bit. Feel free to adjust accordingly.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the garlic until very lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, add the baby bok choy, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the bok choy are tender, about 6 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.",
