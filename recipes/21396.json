    "des": "\"Sweet orange marmalade enhances the flavor of the tart cranberries in this wonderful dish.  For a more intense flavor, use 1/4 cup dried cranberries or cherries instead of fresh or frozen cranberries and do not chop.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Generously grease a 9x9 inch glass baking dish.\nIn a bowl, mix cranberries, marmalade, and cloves.  Make a pocket in each pork chop by cutting into pork toward the bone; fill pockets with cranberry mixture.\nPlace the pork chops in prepared baking pan.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon 1 tablespoon honey over each chop.  Bake uncovered about 45 minutes or until pork is no longer pink in the center.",
