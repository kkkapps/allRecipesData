    "des": "\"In Australia, and some other overseas countries, pumpkin means squash. I like to use butternut squash because it's sweet. You can also substitute frozen egg whites for all those eggs and cut back on fat and calories. This would make a great brunch, but we like it for supper. It's even good cold.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch square baking dish and line it with parchment paper.\nPlace the pumpkin in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and cook in microwave on full power, stirring halfway through cooking time, until tender, about 5 minutes. Place the potato in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and cook in microwave on full power until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 4 minutes.\nCombine the pumpkin and potato in a large bowl. Add the spinach, feta cheese, Cheddar cheese, and eggs; stir. Transfer mixture to prepared dish; top with sliced onion.\nBake in preheated oven until firm, about 25 minutes. Allow to rest 5 minutes before serving.",
