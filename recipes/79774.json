    "des": "\"I use this recipe for marinara sauce as a base for all my pasta dishes. You can use the sauce 'as is' for a meatless spaghetti sauce. Or you can add just about any meat or seafood to add variety to your meals. In addition, you can add kidney beans and your favorite ingredients to make a super chili. My kids eat this pasta sauce like no other. They are happy campers when the house is filled with the aroma as this sauce is cooking.\"",
