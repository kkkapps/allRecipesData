    "des": "\"A complete change from the typical dish, this is inspired by the recipe of the Walker family of Orange Beach, AL.  It is roux based, not cream, and is rich, hearty and deeply satisfying. Red pepper flakes and/or hot sauce may be added as desired.\"",
    "ins": "Cook the bacon in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat until browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Pour off all but 1/4 cup of bacon fat, and stir in the onions and celery until the onions have turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, and cook until the flour begins to brown, about 10 minutes.\nPour in the clam juice, water, and potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the oysters. Recover, and simmer 5 minutes until the oysters have firmed. Ladle into bowls to serve.",
