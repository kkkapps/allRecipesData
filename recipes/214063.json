    "des": "\"Inspired by an incredibly popular salad sold in a local award winning market here in Woodstock, VT.  Since they don't give out the recipe, I had to figure it out on my own.  But I (and others) believe that my version is infinitely better, and I'm sure you will agree.  This light, fresh and healthy salad is perfect for summer days and presents well for BBQ's, potlucks, and dinner parties alike and it is guaranteed to impress and get rave reviews every time.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCombine the carrots, almonds, and garlic in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with the olive oil, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Spread out onto an ungreased baking sheet.\nBake the carrots in the preheated oven until soft and the edges turn brown, about 30 minutes. Remove and allow to cool to room temperature.\nOnce cool, return the carrots to the mixing bowl, and drizzle with honey and vinegar; toss until coated. Add the cranberries and blue cheese; toss again until evenly mixed. Combine with the arugula and serve immediately.",
