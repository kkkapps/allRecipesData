    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nIn the same skillet, stir cabbage in the bacon drippings until coated. Place lid on skillet and cook over medium heat until cabbage is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in sugar and season with salt and pepper. Cook uncovered, stirring constantly until cabbage is crisp and brown on the edges. Serve cabbage with bacon crumbled on top.",
