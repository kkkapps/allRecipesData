Pour over the roast and then cover the roast tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the roast is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.\nWhen the roast is done, remove it from the pan to a serving plate. Set the pan of drippings over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Stir together cornstarch and 1/4 cup of cold water. Pour into the boiling liquid and stir until thickened, about 1 minute.
