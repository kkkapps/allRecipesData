Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nStir 3 tablespoons honey, the lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger together in a small bowl; spread evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange the sliced pears in 2 rows.\nBeat the eggs, milk, 1 tablespoon honey, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger together in a shallow dish; soak each piece of bread in the egg mixture and arrange atop the pears.\nBake in the preheated oven until the bread is set and golden brown, about 20 minutes.\nTo serve, cut into squares and use a thin, flat spatula to lift each portion out of the pan and turn pear side up. Sprinkle with toasted almonds and drizzle with any syrup left in the baking dish.",
