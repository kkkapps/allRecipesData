    "des": "\"This is a hearty hot, spicy dip that is delicious with corn chips.  Tastes much different than you would imagine from the ingredients. Others who I have given this recipe to always want to leave out one ingredient or another.  I don't recommend doing this, at least not the first time you make it, as I feel every single one of the ingredients adds something to the flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until starting to brown. Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper and jalapeno pepper, and cook until meat is no longer pink. Drain excess grease. Fill the pan with enough water to cover the beef, cover, and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.\nStir in the almonds, pimentos, raisins, tomatoes, tomato paste and sugar. Season with oregano and salt. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally for at least 1 hour.",
