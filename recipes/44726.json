    "des": "\"An excellent cod fish dish. You must soak the salted cod over night and change the water at least twice. This is an easy fish meal with my moms original ingredients.\"",
    "ins": "Soak salted cod in cold water overnight or for a few hours. Drain water, repeat. Heat a large pot of water until boiling. Cook cod for 5 minutes; drain and cool, leaving cod in large pieces. Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn an 8x11 casserole dish, layer half the potato slices, all of the cod, and all of the onions. Top with remaining potato slices. In a small bowl, mix together olive oil, garlic, parsley, pepper flakes, paprika, and tomato sauce. Pour evenly over casserole.\nBake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.",
