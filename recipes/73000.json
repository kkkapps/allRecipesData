    "des": "\"This is a Filipino recipe which was carried down to me. I just added the jalapeno for spice and used the chicken wings. You can use pork or whole cut up chicken, too. This is great as an appetizer or you can serve it as a meal with steamed Jasmine rice.  Enjoy this! you will never go back to the same ol' hot wings.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the wings, and boil for 5 to 8 minutes. Drain in a colander and run under warm water. Return to the dry pot, and add the vinegar, water, bay leaves, peppercorns, onion and jalapenos. Simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.\nSeason the chicken with soy sauce, and simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by 1/2. Remove the wings to a colander, and set aside. Add a few garlic cloves to the liquid in the pan, and simmer until the sauce has a syrupy consistency, and the jalapenos have burst open releasing all of their seeds into the reduction.\nHeat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken wings and the remaining garlic. Cook and stir until the garlic is tender and the wings have browned, about 10 minutes. Return wings to the sauce to coat before serving.",
