    "des": "\"This is my favorite kale salad. It is super nutrient-dense and loaded with healthy fats and lots of flavor. The technique of 'massaging' the kale is very important since it breaks it down, softens the texture, and makes it more palatable. Please take the time to remove the leaves from the stems. The stems are tough and very bitter. Use any kind of kale for this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Combine green kale, red kale, pecans, apple cider vinegar, honey, chipotle pepper powder, paprika, and liquid amino acid together in a bowl. Massage the kale mixture together using your hands until leaves are evenly coated and starting to soften, about 3 minutes; fold in avocado.",
