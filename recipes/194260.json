    "ins": "Blend butter, cottage cheese, and salt in a large bowl. Gently mix in flour. Dough will be sticky. Divide dough into 4 equal balls. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.\nPreheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nFlour a surface lightly and roll 1 ball of dough into a circle using a rolling pin. Sprinkle the circle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut the circle into 8 equal pieces. Take 1 slice of dough and roll into a crescent shape, starting with the wide end and finishing with tucking the triangle tip under the roll. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the slices and dough balls.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
