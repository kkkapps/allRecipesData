    "des": "\"Great for Thai cooking. I got the recipe a long time ago from a friend, who suggested that making red curry paste is better than buying it in the store; he was right! You can mix the ingredients as you like. Curry is something that can be experimented with and should be! Just make sure that you do not remove the ingredients, as it will remove authenticity. For a more mild curry paste, remove and discard the chile pepper seeds.\"",
