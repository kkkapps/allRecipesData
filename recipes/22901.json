    "des": "\"My mother, Marea Mooney, made this soup for her six children. It is a warm and filling mixture of potatoes, green beans, and frankfurters that's easy to make and perfect for a cold winter day. Adjust ingredients to taste. We all love it; hope you do, too! Serve with salad and warm rolls.\"",
    "ins": "Place the onion and margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Slowly cook and stir until the onion is soft. Mix in the potatoes and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and mix in the tomato sauce, chicken broth, green beans and frankfurters. Simmer 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.",
