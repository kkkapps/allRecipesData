    "des": "\"One of the best uses for Portuguese bread is in baked French toast. Because the bread is so light it soaks up a lot of the batter and becomes too fragile to pan-fry. So...baking is the answer. Serve the French toast with maple syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhisk together the eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and orange rind in a medium mixing bowl.\nCut the bread into seven or eight slices, and lay them, overlapping, in a large baking dish.\nPour the egg mixture over the bread, covering every slice. The bread should not be entirely submerged though; the higher parts should become toasted and crispy.\nDot the bread with the butter. Bake the French toast in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes until the custard is set. Serve immediately.",
