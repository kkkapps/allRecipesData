    "des": "\"A fresh Hachiya persimmon should feel soft and jellylike when ripe. Lemon juice may be added to the puree to prevent discoloration and enhance the taste.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch baking dish or cake pan.\nWhirl the pulp in a blender until smooth. Blend together the persimmon pulp and baking soda in a small bowl.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the puree to the creamed mixture. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves; gradually blend the flour mixture into the persimmon mixture. Stir in nuts and citrus zests; batter will be stiff. Spoon into prepared cake pan.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, and turn out on a rack to continue cooling an additional 20 or 30 minutes before serving.  Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.",
