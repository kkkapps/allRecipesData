    "des": "\"This is a delicious way to utilize the shoulders of deer or elk.  The process takes a little time but is well worth it.  The curing gets rid of the gamey flavor of the venison. You may add one tablespoon of pickling spice if desired for a more intense flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Stir in the curing mixture, brown sugar, pickling spice, and garlic powder; stir until dissolved then remove from the heat. Pour 6 cups of cold water into a 2-gallon container, and stir in the spice mixture. Place the boneless venison into the brine, cover and refrigerate.\nLeave the venison in the refrigerator to brine for 5 days, turning the meat over every day.\nTo cook, rinse the meat well, place into a large pot, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 4 hours. Remove the venison from the pot, and allow to rest for 30 minutes before slicing.",
