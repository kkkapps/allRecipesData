    "ins": "Measure the tequila, lime juice, sweetened lime juice and triple sec into a cocktail shaker and add a generous scoop of ice. Cover and shake until the shaker is frosty, about 30 seconds.\nRub a lime wedge around the rim of a margarita glass and dip in salt. Fill each glass with ice. Strain equal amounts of the cocktail into the glasses to serve. Garnish with a lime wedge.",
