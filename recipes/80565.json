We've always made our tourtieres en grand (in large quantity), as they freeze great making them a terrific quick fix throughout the busy holiday season!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a large pot, mix the pork, beef, onion, and water. Season with salt, pepper, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and chicken seasoning. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes.\nDrain liquid from pot into a bowl. Transfer remaining meat mixture to a separate bowl and chill until ready to use. Place bowl with liquid in the refrigerator and chill 1 hour, or until fat has congealed on the surface.\nScrape and discard fat from the chilled liquid. Spoon the meat mixture into pie crusts.  Add 1 tablespoon of reserved liquid to each pie. (This prevents them from becoming to dry.) Place top crust on top of each pie and pinch edges to seal.  Cut slits in top crust so steam can escape.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 50 minutes. Serve immediately or freeze until ready to use.",
