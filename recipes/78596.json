    "des": "\"Here's an easy, lower-fat version of warm artichoke-cheese dip. In new research, artichoke hearts tested surprisingly high in antioxidant activity -- even more per cup than strawberries. Garlic and chives are high in antioxidants, too, and fat-free cottage cheese helps keep the fat and calorie counts down.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.\nCook artichokes according to package directions; chop roughly. Set aside.\nIn a food processor, mix all ingredients except artichokes and Parmesan cheese until smooth.\nStir in artichokes. Pour mixture into a 9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with Parmesan.\nBake for 30 minutes. If top hasn't browned, put under broiler.\nLet sit for 15 minutes before serving (it may be watery when first removed from the oven). Serve with toasted whole-wheat pita chips.",
