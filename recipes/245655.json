    "ins": "Combine pancake mix and water in a large bowl; mix well. Stir in diced apples. Place batter in the refrigerator to rest, about 15 minutes.\nHeat sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it melts into a thick amber-colored liquid, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add apple cider slowly to the saucepan, stirring constantly, until mixture is the consistency of syrup, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cover.\nHeat a lightly greased skillet over medium-high heat. Drop a scant 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve with cider syrup.",
