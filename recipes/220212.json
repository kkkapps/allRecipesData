Gently toss between your hands so any cheese crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the coated chicken onto a plate while coating the rest; do not stack.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken strips in batches until no longer pink in the center and crust is golden brown, about 4 minutes on each side.",
