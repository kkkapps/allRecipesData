Add the mixture to the saucepan and bring to a boil.\nSimmer for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until the desired consistency is reached. The sauce will thicken further as it cools.\nPuree the sauce in a blender or with a handheld immersion blender and strain it through a fine sieve. Serve warm or cold. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.",
