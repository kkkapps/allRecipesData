It stated that nectarine skin has natural pectin and jam would set as long as the fruit wasn't peeled (Note: no pectin listed in the ingredient list). Just for fun, I decided to experiment with the microwave. The result was oh, so delicious. I made mine in the microwave-safe cup of the Magic Bullet\u00c2\u00ae and blended it right in the cup.\"",
