    "des": "\"A shrimp dip recipe without cream cheese!  This is my mom's famous recipe. If you love shrimp, this is for you.  Prepared from ingredients you have in your pantry, you can whip this up anytime. The secret is the curry powder and the canned, not fresh, shrimp. Try this -- you'll love how easy it is to make, and your guests will love the rich shrimp flavor!\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, place the small shrimp. Mash with a fork. Mix in creamy salad dressing, e.g. Miracle Whip (TM), curry powder and onion. Thoroughly blend. Garnish with paprika. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 45 minutes before serving.",
