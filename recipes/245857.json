    "des": "\"This chicken dish is incredibly easy to make and very delicious. It's a childhood favorite of my partner's; his mom served it with rice and green beans for an easy weekday meal. Feel free to add other hot sauce or spices to jazz it up. Frank's RedHot\u00c2\u00ae sauce is a great addition.\"",
