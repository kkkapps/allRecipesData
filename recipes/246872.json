    "des": "\"There is nothing like homemade gnocchi. They taste like potatoes with a bouncy texture, even without gluten. This gluten-free version uses a trick from the past when Italian cooks would toss potatoes into a fire or oven that was being cooled down so as not to waste the heat. Surplus baked potatoes became gnocchi because they have very little moisture (the secret to firm gnocchi) and they have a roasted potato flavor, taking your dish one step farther.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prick each potato a few times with a fork and place on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.\nPeel potatoes and pass through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl. Make a well in the mashed potatoes with a wooden spoon and pour in egg; mix well.\nWhisk potato starch, sweet rice flour, and salt together in a bowl. Sprinkle over potato mixture; stir until a soft dough has formed. Cut dough into 4 equal parts with a knife or pastry cutter.\nDust work surface with rice flour to keep dough from sticking. Roll out 1 piece of dough into a rope about 1 inch in diameter. Cut into 1-inch gnocchi. Gently roll each one with the back of a fork to create ridges. Repeat with remaining dough.\nShake off any excess rice flour and let gnocchi rest, about 5 minutes.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi in batches and cook, without stirring, until they float to the top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.",
