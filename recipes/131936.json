The result is this wonderful light and creamy eggnog-flavored ice cream. It makes one quart plus.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the eggnog, whipping cream, and milk together in a bowl, and pour the mixture into the freezer container of an ice cream maker. Freeze according to manufacturer's directions. Once frozen, spoon the ice cream into a container, and freeze 2 hours more.",
