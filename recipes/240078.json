    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.\nStir milk, sugar, and butter together in a saucepan over medium-high heat until butter and sugar melt, 1 to 2 minutes.\nMix milk mixture and pumpkin puree together in a bowl. Add cornmeal into pumpkin mixture 1/2 cup at a time, stirring batter well after each addition. Stir egg yolks and salt into batter.\nBeat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cornbread comes out clean, about 35 minutes.",
