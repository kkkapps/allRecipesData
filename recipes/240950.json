    "des": "\"I searched on the internet for braised cucumbers after watching 'Julie and Julia' for the umpteenth time. There weren't many recipes and they were all different. I took the information from all the recipes and meshed them together, deleting some ingredients and adding others. The dish turned out wonderful. This is a side dish that I have served with quite a few different types of main dishes. It seems to go with almost any type of food.\"",
    "ins": "Place cucumbers in a shallow baking dish and sprinkle kosher salt over the top; toss to coat and let rest, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Drain cucumbers and discard any accumulated liquid.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir cucumbers in hot butter until cucumbers are heated through and color starts to change, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer cucumbers to a serving dish and season with lemon juice, mint, and black pepper.",
