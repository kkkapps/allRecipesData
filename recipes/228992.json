    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace pork tenderloin in a shallow 9x13-inch; sprinkle with brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. Spread pineapple preserves over tenderloin. Arrange onion, orange bell pepper, and red bell pepper on and around tenderloin. Mix reserved juice from mandarin oranges and crushed pineapple in a small bowl; pour in at least 1/2 cup reserved juice.\nBake in the preheated oven until tenderloin is no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes. Spoon mandarin oranges and pineapple over tenderloin in the last 20 minutes of cooking. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of pork should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
