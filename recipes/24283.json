    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nTo make the dough cut 1/2 cup butter into 1 cup flour using a knife or pastry blender. Add water as needed and mix until crumbly, leaving pea-sized chunks. On a floured surface roll the dough out to 3 or 4 inches in width.  Place on a rectangular cookie sheet.\nIn a small saucepan over high heat, bring 1 cup water and 1/2 cup butter to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in flour; mix until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in 1 teaspoon almond extract.  Spread filling over dough.\nBake in preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes. The pastry will fall a little as it cools.\nMeanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, cream, 1 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon almond extract. Spread icing over pastry as soon as it's removed from the oven.",
