    "des": "\"Surprisingly mild and easy to make, this dish takes to substitutions well depending on what you have in the house. Despite the name, even my young children enjoy this chicken! It's quick, easy, and something different for dinner. Apple juice may be substituted for the applesauce and wine. Grainy, spicier mustards will create a spicier sauce; mild or sweet mustards will create a milder sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken on both sides with pepper; cook the chicken breasts in the butter until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6 to 7 minutes each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the breasts from the pan and set aside.\nStir together the onion, parsley, applesauce, wine, mustard, and half-and-half in the pan; bring the mixture to a boil and cook about 5 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan; add the walnuts. Allow to cook until the chicken is warm, 3 to 5 minutes.",
