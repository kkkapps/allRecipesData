    "des": "\"Inspired by the Peruvian rotisserie chicken, this recipe combines 'pollo a la brasa' seasoning with the beer can cooking technique. The goal is to produce a tasty chicken with a crispy exterior and juicy interior. Serve it with fries and the salad of your choice.\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in water in a large bowl and stir in lime juice. Soak chicken in the mixture for 10 minutes; rinse and pat chicken dry with paper towels. Pierce the chicken all over with a fork to make many tiny holes.\nStir vinegar, cumin, olive oil, oregano, rosemary, paprika, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, soy sauce, and black pepper in a small bowl; mix in enough beer to form a paste, about 2 tablespoons. Retain remaining beer in the can.\nRub spice paste all over the chicken, beneath the skin, and inside cavity; refrigerate for 1 hour.\nPreheat grill for medium heat; a grill thermometer should read 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) with the lid closed.\nSit the chicken upright on the partially-filled can of beer and extend drumsticks to the grill surface to form a tripod shape to hold up the chicken.\nGrill chicken with the lid closed until the skin is brown and crisp and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast, not touching bone, reads 170 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing.",
