    "des": "\"This recipe is one I created this evening after going to the local market. Wild cod was on sale and my husband was craving it. I thought the delicate flavor of cod would work perfectly with a tangy salsa. This recipe was super easy to make and perfect for a hot summer night!\"",
    "ins": "Stir the mango, tomato, cucumber, garbanzo beans, lime juice, lemon juice, jalapeno pepper, red pepper flakes, and lemon basil in a bowl; season with kosher salt. Set aside.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nSeason the cod with the paprika, salt, and pepper; brush with the canola oil.\nCook the cod on the preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Quickly warm the tortillas on the grill just before the cod is finished. Serve the cod in the warm tortillas topped with the mango salsa.",
