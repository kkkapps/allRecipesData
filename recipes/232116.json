    "des": "\"I love the sweet and tangy pineapple sauce. I serve this over rice and accompany it with green beans. This recipe was handed down to me from my mother-in-law many years ago.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir ketchup and brown sugar into melted butter, stirring to dissolve brown sugar. Whisk cornstarch into vinegar until smooth; pour into pan. Whisk constantly and add salt, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce to mixture; bring to a simmer. Cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir pineapple into sauce.\nArrange chicken pieces in a 9x13-inch baking dish; pour pineapple sauce over chicken.\nBake until sauce is bubbling, chicken is browned, and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
