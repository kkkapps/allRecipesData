Let cool, and crumble.\nPlace the ground beef and onions into a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir until the meat is no longer pink, breaking the meat apart as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Transfer the beef and onion mixture into a large Dutch oven. Stir in the crumbled bacon, honey barbecue sauce, pork and beans, kidney beans, lima beans, black beans, brown sugar, cider vinegar, liquid smoke, salt, and pepper.\nCover, and bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 1 hour.",
