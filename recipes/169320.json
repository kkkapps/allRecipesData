Place the stuffed peppers into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nStir remaining can of tomato sauce, brown sugar, parsley, basil, and oregano together in a bowl. Spoon tomato sauce over peppers in the baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until peppers are hot and beginning to brown, about 1 hour. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.",
