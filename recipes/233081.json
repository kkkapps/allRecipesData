    "des": "\"This recipe has been told to me by my girlfriends MIL from Mexico. I had to measure the ingredients. Never before have they been measured, always a 'handful of this and equal parts of this' until it looked right. I hope you enjoy it. It has become a family favorite in our home. I am always asked to make it!\"",
