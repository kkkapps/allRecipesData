    "des": "\"These fritters are great served with hot sauce as a BBQ side dish or with butter and maple syrup as a hearty breakfast. Always a hit! Add more flour if necessary to make the batter the consistency of pancake batter.\"",
    "ins": "Remove all silk from corn and cut raw corn from the cob over a large bowl. Scrape the juice from the cobs into the bowl as well. Discard cobs. Stir in the eggs, flour and salt to form a batter the consistency of thin pancake batter.\nHeat oil in an electric skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). If using a large skillet on the stove, preheat oil to medium high heat. There should be enough oil in the pan to cover the fritter.\nUse a large serving spoon to make 4 pancake sized fritters at the same time. Fry for about 5 minutes on each side or until golden  brown. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.",
