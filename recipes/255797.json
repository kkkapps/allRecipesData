    "des": "\"This is my grandmother's recipe that she made each Thanksgiving when I was growing up. She was a native Hoosier and resided in Orleans, IN for many years. Although not a huge fan of cooking, this is one recipe she made very well and it is always one that makes me remember her fondly. Serve chilled and top with whipped cream.\"",
