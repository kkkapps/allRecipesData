    "des": "\"I often eat at Macaroni Grill and order their Pollo Scaloppine. I thought I might try and adapt it at home using a mild fish. My husband was amazed at what I came up with. It's good with salad, brown rice and crusty bread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil with butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic. Place fish fillets in the skillet; sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper, and cook for 90 seconds. Turn the fish; season with salt and pepper, and cook an additional 90 seconds.\nAdd the mushrooms, capers, and wine. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until the fish flakes easily with a fork and the wine is reduced by half, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the cover, pour in lemon juice, and cook for one minute.",
