    "des": "\"I created this recipe when frustrated by the packets of glaze that came with spiral hams bought at the grocery store. It is sweet, with the perfect amount of spice, and makes a nice crust on the outside of the ham, similar to the famous ham store's. This recipe makes enough to cover a 3 to 5 pound ham. Store in an airtight tin if not using immediately.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, mustard powder, onion powder, and pepper in a bowl until well blended. Makes enough rub to cover one 3 to 5 pound ham. To be sure sugars form a crust, do not cover the ham during cooking. If not using immediately, store in an airtight tin.",
