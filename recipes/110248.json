    "des": "\"Lightly sweet pancakes with a hint of peanut butter and little chunks of banana.  Flavorful enough that you don't even need the syrup. Makes little pancakes that are easy for little fingers to pick up and dunk in syrup, or cut into pieces for littler ones.  Add more or less milk to make thicker or thinner pancakes.  Makes enough for Mom and a few small kids.\"",
    "ins": "Combine flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt in a large bowl.  Mix in the peanut butter until the texture resembles cornmeal.  Add milk and vanilla; stir just until blended.  Stir in the banana pieces.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray.  Spoon batter onto the skillet, using approximately 2 tablespoons to form each silver dollar pancake.  Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.",
