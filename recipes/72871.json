    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nIn a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Stir in the egg and coconut extract. Combine the flour and potato flakes, and stir into the batter until well blended. Drop heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 12 minutes, or until the tops are still white, and the bottoms are light brown. This will insure chewy cookies. Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
