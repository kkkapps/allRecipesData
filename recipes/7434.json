    "ins": "Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, and process for 5 minutes.  Stop once in a while and wipe down the sides.\nTransfer to a bowl of a stand-up mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.  Mix on medium-high until white and fluffy, at least 15 minutes.  Use straight away.",
