    "ins": "Fill a large bowl with room-temperature water. Soak 1 rice wrapper in the water until it bends easily, about 15 seconds.\nLay wrapper flat. In a row across the center, place a small handful of lettuce leaves, a few strips of chicken, and a few slices of red bell pepper, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.\nCut in half and serve with Caesar dressing for dipping.",
