Drain asparagus and set aside.\nBeat eggs, half-and-half, parsley, salt, white pepper, and green hot sauce in a bowl until smooth.\nStir together cooked chicken, Swiss cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, mushrooms, and green onions in a bowl; mix in flour.\nLine a 9-inch pie dish with pie crust.\nSpread about half of the cooked asparagus over the bottom of the crust.\nSpread about half of the chicken mixture over the asparagus.\nRepeat layers of asparagus and chicken mixture.\nGently pour the egg mixture over the layers.\nArrange 3 asparagus spears decoratively on top of the quiche.\nBake in the preheated oven until the filling is slightly puffed and lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.\nSprinkle quiche with cherry tomatoes, if desired.",
