    "ins": "Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Return to the pot, and mash with the milk, butter, salt, and pepper.\nWhile the potatoes are boiling, place the hot dogs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then keep warm on low until the potatoes have been mashed.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nCut the hot dogs down the center, leaving the two halves attached (like a hot dog bun). Stuff the hot dogs with mashed potatoes and place into a baking dish. Place half a slice of cheese on top of each hot dog.\nBroil in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly and has melted, about 1 minute.",
