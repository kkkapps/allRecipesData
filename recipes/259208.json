These turned out the mounded cookies that our family so loves. When my husband commented 'these might be the best cookies you've ever made,' I knew they were good enough to share.\"",

Beat in persimmon pulp. Add eggs and vanilla extract; beat until well combined, scraping sides of the bowl occasionally.\nStir flour mixture into persimmon mixture by hand until thoroughly combined. Add dates and oats; mix dough well.\nDrop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
