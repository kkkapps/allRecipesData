    "ins": "Heat the sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the edamame, soy sauce, and 3/4 teaspoons of ground ginger. Cook and stir until the edamame is hot and the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\nMeanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the rice, and stir until the rice is coated in oil and has started to toast, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the garlic powder and white wine. Let the wine simmer until it has mostly evaporated, then stir in one-third of the hot water; continue stirring until the rice has absorbed the liquid and turned creamy. Repeat this process twice more, stirring constantly. Stirring in the water should take 15 to 20 minutes in all. When finished, the rice should be tender, yet slightly firm.\nStir in the edamame, goat cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger until the cheeses have melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.",
