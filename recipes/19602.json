    "des": "\"I never seem to make enough of this salad. When people see the recipe, they look at me as if I am a little odd...but when they eat it they can't seem to stop! This recipe is great for kids and adults alike. The garlic is optional. Also, to lighten up the salad, substitute light mayonnaise, light sour cream, and turkey ham.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the drained pasta, ham, peppers, onion, pickles and tomatoes.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, beef bouillon granules, vinegar, salt, pepper, garlic and 1/2 cup of reserved pickle juice.  Fold into the salad and toss gently until evenly coated.  Chill overnight to allow the flavors to blend.  Serve near room temperature.",
