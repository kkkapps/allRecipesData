They'll probably need more salt than you think, so don't be shy! You can use any combination of the following veggies and even cook them in a frying pan instead of grilling if you want.\"",

Pour olive oil over vegetables and toss to evenly coat. Season with salt and pepper.\nGrill vegetables on preheated grill until lightly charred, 3 to 5 minutes per side.",
