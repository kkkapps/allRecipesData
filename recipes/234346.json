Knowing how picky we were at the time, it was a good thing she did. I now make this recipe and add some green beans near the end. The sauce results in juicy chicken that is just spicy enough.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.\nArrange chicken into the prepared baking dish.\nMix French dressing, ketchup, onion flakes, chili seasoning, and parsley flakes together in a small bowl; spoon evenly over the chicken pieces. Cover dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove and discard aluminum foil, spread green beans over the chicken, and continue baking until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
