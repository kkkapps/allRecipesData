    "des": "\"The chicken is rubbed with a simple blend of Mexican spices and and baked for the initial cooking, then finished on the grill with tangy sweet glaze that's got just enough heat. The glaze works equally well on grilled pork chops. My family prefers leg quarters, but any chicken will work by simply adjusting the cooking time.\"",
    "ins": "Cut chicken leg quarters at the joint without cutting all the way through. Arrange chicken on a baking dish.\nMix New Mexico chile powder, ancho chile powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Rub chile powder mixture over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat chicken with olive oil.\nBake in preheated oven until browned, about 45 minutes. Chicken will not be cooked through.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nHeat mango nectar, rum, orange juice, lime juice, honey, and chile paste in a skillet over medium-high heat. Simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Brush mango glaze over chicken legs.\nGrill chicken on preheated grill until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 more minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
