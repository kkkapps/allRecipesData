    "des": "\"These easy, spicy chicken wings are an excellent alternative to regular hot wings! I learned this recipe from my mother, who is from Taiwan, and it was always a childhood favorite! Almost all seasonings can be adjusted according to taste. (The Vietnamese chili garlic sauce can be found at any oriental grocery or even most regular groceries).\"",
    "ins": "Rinse and pat dry the chicken wings. Whisk together the sugar, soy sauce, rice wine, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, and garlic in a large bowl, then add the chicken wings and toss to evenly coat.\nHeat a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chicken wings, sauce, and water. Cover and cook until the chicken wings are no longer pink at the bone, turning the chicken wings occasionally, about 15 minutes. Remove lid and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.",
