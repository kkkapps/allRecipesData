    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the oats and crushed candies. Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Combine the white and red sugars. Flatten cookies to 1/4 inch thickness using the bottom of a glass dipped in the sugar mixture.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the bottoms are lightly brown. Allow cookies to cool for at least 2 minutes on the baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
