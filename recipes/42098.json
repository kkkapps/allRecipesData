Set aside.\nCream together the margarine, brown sugar and white sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated.\nFill each muffin cup 1/3 full, and place a chocolate egg in the center of each. Top with remaining batter until cups are 2/3 full.\nBake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown, and tops spring back when lightly tapped.",
