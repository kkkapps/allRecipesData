    "des": "\"This is a vegetarian tomato soup and you can add more basil if you like.  I make it a lot at the restaurant I work in, and it is a favorite of customers and staff.  If you want a more intense basil flavor, try adding some fresh chopped basil to the soup just before serving. The longer you cook basil the more the flavor mellows.\"",
    "ins": "In a blender or food processor, puree whole tomatoes until smooth.\nIn a large pot over medium heat, cook zucchini, onions and mushrooms in oil until tender.  Pour in pureed tomatoes.  Season with salt, bay leaves, thyme, basil and white pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.  Remove bay leaves before serving.",
