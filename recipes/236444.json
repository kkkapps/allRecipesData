    "des": "\"A Peruvian meal that my Japanese mother loved. This is her quick, altered version of the meal. Unfortunately she never measured the ingredients, so I always have to guess and taste-test this at every step. You can substitute ground turkey for pork if desired. I usually end up adding more cumin, garlic, and soy sauce right before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pork, garlic, and cumin until pork is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork mixture, including oil, to a pot.\nMix potatoes, tomatoes, and onion into pork mixture; cook and stir over medium heat until potatoes are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Add enough soy sauce to color and season pork and potato mixture.\nStir parsley, oregano, and cilantro into pork and potato mixture; season with salt and pepper. Serve over cooked rice.",
