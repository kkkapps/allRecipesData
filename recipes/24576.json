    "ins": "In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.\nIn a large bowl, combine yeast mixture, sugar, salt and 1 cup flour; beat well. Beat in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a stiff dough is formed. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in volume.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12 pieces. Roll pieces out into long sticks and form into pretzel shape. Place pretzels on prepared baking sheet. Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with kosher salt.\nBake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown.",
