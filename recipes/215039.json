    "des": "\"This grated beet wonder will be sure to spice up any meal. This is a sweet and savory salad with a fine crunch form the walnuts. This recipe can be a little messy to work with because the boiled beets tend to dye everything red, so be sure that you are equipped with an apron.\"",
    "ins": "Place the beets into a large saucepan with enough water to cover the beets by 1 inch. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beets are easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes; drain. Chill beets in refrigerator until cool enough to handle.\nPeel the beets and grate into a large bowl. Stir the prunes, walnuts, and pickle with the beets. Add the mayonnaise and stir until all the ingredients are evenly coated. Chill completely before serving.",
