    "des": "\"They may sound difficult, but I could seriously burn water and created this recipe myself. I tend not to use actual measurements (I like them really chocolaty), but stick close to what I have here.  Everyone who has ever tasted them, loves them... And if I can make them, anyone can.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the shortening, white sugar, brown sugar and honey until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the oats, cereal, jumbo chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
