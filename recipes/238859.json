    "des": "\"I wanted to make a pasta salad, but didn't feel like going shopping, so I rummaged through my kitchen to see what was available that could be done in less than an hour - difficult for me, since I like to cook from scratch as much as possible! I ate it as a main dish, but it would also make a great side dish. The chile paste recipe came from an online guide to pickled mangoes. The mangoes didn't come out well, so I use the chile paste to add a kick to any of my recipes.\"",
    "ins": "Combine Thai chiles, salt, sugar, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes in a mortar and pestle. Pound until a paste is formed.\nPlace farro in a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and add beef base. Cook farro, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 30 minutes. Drain.\nHeat sesame oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in broccoli; cook until color brightens, about 3 minutes. Mix in tomatoes, basil, and oregano. Add butter and the chile paste, stirring constantly until melted, about 3 minutes. Add lemon juice; stir briefly. Remove pan from heat and mix in the cooked farro.",
