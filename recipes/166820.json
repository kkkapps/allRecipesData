    "des": "\"I am overrun with wild cilantro in my back yard.  Literally, it feeds my compost bin more than my family even though we use it in everything.  This sauce (perhaps more of a pesto) is fabulous on anything but the obvious choices are chicken and tuna.  Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Cut the stem end off of the chile peppers, and remove the seeds using a thin knife, otherwise leaving the peppers whole. Place the peppers into a skillet, and toast over medium-high heat, turning frequently, until the skins of the peppers have blackened and loosened, about 10 minutes. The peppers are ready when 1/4 of the skin has blackened. Remove the peppers, place into a small bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to cool and steam for about 15 minutes, then remove and discard the skins. Chop the peppers, and set aside.\nHeat the sesame oil in the skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook for 2 minutes to soften, then increase heat to medium-high, and stir in the chopped peppers and salt. Cook and stir until the mixture is hot and sizzling, about 1 minute. Pour in the vinegar, brown sugar, and fish sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and allow to simmer for 10 minutes.\nScrape the mixture into a blender, and add the soy sauce, lime juice, cilantro, and green onion. Puree until smooth. Serve immediately.",
