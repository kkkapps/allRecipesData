    "des": "\"A delicious take on the traditional taco. A light, fluffy fried bread complete with fresh refried beans, shredded spicy beef, and toppings like shredded cheese, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream. Most of the cooking time is from using the slow cooker. It only takes 30 minutes from frying the bread to serving this wonderful meal.\"",
    "ins": "Mix beef chuck, beef broth, onion, red wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons chili powder, garlic, 2 teaspoons cumin, salt, and black pepper together in a slow cooker.\nCook on High until beef is tender, about 4 hours. Transfer beef from slow cooker to a cutting board. Shred using 2 forks. Return shredded beef to the slow cooker. Cook on High until flavors combine, about 1 hour. Drain excess juice.\nCombine flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl. Pour in milk; mix until a dough forms.\nKnead dough on a floured work surface until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let dough rest, about 5 minutes. Divide into 4 equal sections and roll out into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Poke a hole into the center of each with your finger.\nHeat vegetable oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry each dough round until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side.\nHeat 1/4 cup olive oil in a small pot. Add pinto beans, 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper; stir and mash until heated through, about 5 minutes.\nTop fry bread with pinto bean mixture and shredded beef.",
