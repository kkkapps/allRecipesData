    "des": "\"Once I heard of beer butt chicken, I had to find the perfect version of it and try it. After reviewing multiple recipes, I finally put together my own version of it. It turned out AMAZING. Great flavor and so tender. Normally, I won't eat baked chicken without gravy, but this is the exception.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse the chicken, inside and out, and pat skin dry with paper towels.\nSqueeze juice from lime halves over the outside of the chicken and place the squeezed halves in the cavity. Sprinkle cavity with minced garlic. Stir salt, black pepper, and rosemary in a small bowl and season the outside of the chicken with the mixture.\nPlace chicken upright in a roasting pan, with the beer can inserted into the cavity far enough so the chicken doesn't fall over. Place the onion into the neck cavity to block steam from escaping. Pour water into the bottom of the pan.\nRoast the chicken upright in the preheated oven until sizzling and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh reads 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Baste occasionally with pan drippings. Let chicken cool for about 10 minutes before serving.",
