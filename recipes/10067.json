    "des": "\"An oatmeal cookie for those who like a softer version. Try using pecans in place of the walnuts.\"",
    "ins": "Combine raisins and water in small saucepan.  Simmer over low heat 20 to 30 minutes, until raisins are plump.  Drain liquid from raisins into measuring cup.  If necessary, add enough additional water to raisin liquid to measure 1/2 cup.  Set drained raisins and 1/2 cup raisin liquid aside to cool.\nIn a large mixing bowl, beat shortening, sugar, eggs and vanilla with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.  Stir in reserved 1/2 cup raisin water.\nSift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves into a separate bowl.  Stir flour mixture into shortening mixture with a spoon.  Stir in oats, nuts and reserved raisins; mix well.\nDrop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, onto ungreased baking sheets.  Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)  oven 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Note:  These cookies freeze well.",
