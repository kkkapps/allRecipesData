    "des": "\"Many people don't know what to do with fava beans, but they are extremely versatile. They shine in salads, pastas, and on pizzas. Here we're grilling whole pods until the skin is charred and the beans inside are just tender.\"",
    "ins": "Place whole fava beans in a mixing bowl. Drizzle generously with at least a tablespoon olive oil and the juice of 1 lemon. Sprinkle with half of the kosher salt; add bruised garlic cloves. Toss to coat pods evenly, and occasionally as the grill heats up.\nGrill beans over high heat, about 5 minutes total per side, turning and moving them until they are charred on the outside and the beans inside are soft. Transfer to a serving platter.\nDrizzle with the remaining olive oil; sprinkle with the remaining salt. Add red pepper flakes and mint leaves. Toss to coat. To eat, split open the pod and eat the beans inside, or serve them on half the shell.",
