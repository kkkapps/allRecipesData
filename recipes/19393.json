Add salt and pepper, cover and steam 10 minutes, or until squash is tender.\nWhile vegetables are steaming, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  Add the crushed tomatoes to the zucchini mixture, stir and heat slightly, but do not cook the tomatoes.  Serve the zucchini sauce over the pasta.",
