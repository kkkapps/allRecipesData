    "des": "\"This macaroni salad tastes just like the ones you buy at the local grocery store. Only difference is, it's cheaper to make yourself, and you can make as much as you need. (Let's face it...macaroni salad is always the first one to go.) You can also add relish or onions depending on your desired taste. This recipe is an easy basic starter for you to add your own touch to and have everyone raving about your macaroni salad!\"",
