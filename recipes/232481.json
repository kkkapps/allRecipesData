    "des": "\"My sons really miss flour tortillas since we have gone gluten-free. So I have tinkered with a bunch of wheat flour tortilla recipes to create one that fits our new diet. These aren't your traditional thin tortillas (basically because I press them by hand) but a nice thick and more chewy-style that reminds me of flat bread.\"",
    "ins": "Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture until mixture resembles corn meal. Stir in hot water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, until mixture forms into a ball. Knead dough until evenly combined.\nCut dough into 8 pieces; roll each piece into a ball. Press each ball into a flat tortilla-shape.\nHeat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla in the hot griddle until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.",
