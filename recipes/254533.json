    "des": "\"Chestnut flour makes very unique crepes that happen to be both gluten- and wheat-free. The smoky, nutty flavor of the chestnut flour complements both savory and sweet fillings. Try them stuffed with warm gorgonzola and walnuts topped with vanilla ice cream and roasted hazelnuts. Delicious! Serve or use immediately, or allow to cool and refrigerate until needed. Cooked crepes will stay fresh in the fridge for 2 days. The batter can be refrigerated up to 24 hours.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk milk, eggs, and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Sprinkle in the chestnut flour 1/4 cup at a time, mixing well to avoid lumps, until batter is a liquid consistency. Whisk vigorously; pour through a fine strainer to remove any lumps.\nHeat cooking oil in an 8-inch crepe pan over medium-high heat. Pour in 1/4 cup of batter; swirl batter around to cover the entire surface. Cook until the edges have browned and are easily loosened with a spatula, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving plate. Repeat with remaining batter.",
