Stir in the rice, asparagus, and stock. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low.\nStir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Continue cooking until the rice is tender, about 10 minutes.\nTurn off the heat and gently stir in the Parmesan cheese and remaining butter. Serve immediately.",
