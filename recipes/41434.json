    "des": "\"This dish is absolutely superb! I've always loved lamb and I bought it at the store not knowing what to do with it so I used my imagination. It's moist and tender, full of flavor and served best complimented with sauteed zucchini and rice.\"",
    "ins": "Place lamb chops in a shallow dish, and smear both sides with roasted garlic. Season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Cover with 1 1/2 cups olive oil, and refrigerate overnight.\nRemove chops and marinade from dish, and scrape off the oil, which will have partially solidified in the refrigerator. Place the chops back in the dish, and cover with red wine. Refrigerate for 4 hours.\nHeat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chopped onion until tender. Place the lamb chops into the skillet, cover, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on each side.",
