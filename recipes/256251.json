    "des": "\"Fragrant with fresh sage, orange zest and toasted pecans, this extra creamy roasted squash uses silken tofu as its secret ingredient.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange whole squash on a baking sheet and roast until the skin is papery and a fork inserted in 2 or 3 different spots reveals very tender flesh, about 1 1/4 hours. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel away the skin, and discard the seeds.\nMeanwhile, pulse raisins, pecans, parsley, sage and orange zest in a food processor until finely chopped and transfer to a bowl; wipe out food processor.\nIn the clean food processor, puree warm squash and tofu until very smooth and creamy. (Reheat, if needed, in a medium pot over medium heat.) Transfer to a large bowl or platter, scatter raisin-sage mixture over the top and serve.",
