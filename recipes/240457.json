    "des": "\"The idea of removing pesky bones before your bird makes its grand Thanksgiving entrance is worth considering. Not only do you get an impressive looking roast to wow the table, but carving is significantly easier. If you're worried about losing flavor, don't. This tastes virtually identical. Stuff with your favorite stuffing.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nPlace turkey, skin-side down, on a work surface and arrange meat with your hands into a flat, even surface. Season with salt and black pepper. Press stuffing all over the surface of the meat.\nFold long edges of turkey around stuffing into the center of the bird and carefully turn turkey seam-side down. Tie the leg-end of the turkey with kitchen twine to cinch the turkey together. Repeat ties at 2-inch intervals along the length of the turkey, ending with a single tie along the length of the turkey. Season with salt and place in a large roasting pan.\nRoast turkey in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey reads 155 degrees F (68 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer turkey to a platter; remove and discard twine. Let rest until internal temperature increases to 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20 minutes.\nPlace roasting pan over medium-high heat and stir cream into pan drippings. Cook and stir until sauce thickens and reduces, 3 to 7 minutes. Pour through a fine mesh sieve into a gravy boat or bowl. Slice turkey crosswise and top slices with gravy.",
