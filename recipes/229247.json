Spoon about 3/4 cup of chicken filling down the center of each tortilla in a line. Roll tortillas around filling and place with seam sides down into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nPour enchilada sauce over filled enchiladas and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack and mozzarella cheeses over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and cheese topping is browned at the edges, about 30 minutes.",
