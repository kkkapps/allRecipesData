    "des": "\"Goat is a delicious, mild-flavored meat that is overlooked in the U.S.  This recipe results in a tender, savory dish that, while unusual, is still basically good old comfort food.  This would be great to serve with Israeli-style couscous; alternatively, you could add some potato chunks to the pan halfway through the cooking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season the goat shoulder with salt and pepper, and place into the pan. Brown quickly on all sides. Add the onions to the pan, and cook, stirring constantly until browned. Mix in the prunes and preserved lemon; cook and stir for a few minutes to blend the flavors. Pour in the red wine and chicken broth, and bring to a simmer.\nCover the Dutch oven, and bake for 2 hours, or until meat is so tender that it falls off of the bone.",
