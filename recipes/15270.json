    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, whip egg whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and salt. Continue to whip until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar while whipping, try to add slowly so that it does not fall to the bottom of the bowl. Whip until the mixture holds stiff peaks. Fold in the nuts, fruit and coconut. Drop by rounded teaspoons onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 45 minutes to 1 hour in the preheated oven, until firm. Cool on baking sheets, away from drafts.",
