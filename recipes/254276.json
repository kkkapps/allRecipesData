    "des": "\"What started out as a frustrating attempt to test some pizza dough, turned into what we're calling salami bread. It would make a great Italian submarine sandwich, or just load it up with lots of Italian cheeses and fresh and pickled vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Generously flour a work surface. Flatten out dough to form a rough rectangle. Flour top surface and roll out to a 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness.\nLeaving an inch or so of the long edge uncovered, arrange salami slices in a single row without overlapping them. Create 2 single-layer rows, leaving a wider uncovered edge on the other side. Spread tomato sauce over salami. Generously cover with grated cheese, parsley, and oregano. Brush edges of dough with water.\nBegin rolling from the long edge closest to the salami. Roll fairly tightly without pressing or stretching dough too much to allow it room to rise, pinching in the ends as you go. Finish with seam side down. Carefully transfer roll to a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicon mat. Cover with a dry towel and allow to rise until doubled, 60 to 90 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nLightly brush top and sides of loaf with olive oil. Cut 1-inch deep slits diagonally across the top of the loaf, about 2 inches apart. Dust with grated Parmesan cheese.\nBake in preheated oven on center rack until nicely browned and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer loaf to a cooling rack. Cool completely before slicing.",
