    "des": "\"Chewy oatmeal raisin cookies with lots of flavor. You can also substitute 1/2 cup of wheat germ in place of some of the oatmeal, for a different flavor.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, combine the eggs, raisins, and vanilla. Cover and chill for 1 hour.\nPreheat oven  to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, cinnamon and baking soda; add to the creamed mixture and stir until all of the dry ingredients are absorbed. Next, stir in the egg and raisin mixture, then stir in the rolled oats and pecans. Dough will be stiff. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto an unprepared cookie sheet.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are golden. Allow cookies to cool 5 minutes on the baking sheet before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
