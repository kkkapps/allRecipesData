    "des": "\"This is a creamy German-style potato salad with a tremendous flavor given from Asian ingredients! I made this up on a whim and everyone loved it. I add ham, but feel free to leave it out - it won't alter the flavor much, just the texture.\"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water, and cook about 10 minutes. Stir in the frozen mixed vegetables, and continue cooking 10 to 12 minutes, until potatoes and vegetables are tender. Transfer to a large bowl. Cut potatoes while still hot, into 1 inch pieces. Set aside to cool.\nHeat the olive oil in a skillet. Place the onion in the skillet, and season with garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until tender.\nIn a bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, hot sauce, wasabi powder, ginger, and turmeric. Season with salt and pepper.\nToss the cooled potato and vegetable mixture with the onions, mayonnaise mixture, ham, and cilantro until evenly coated. Chill until serving.",
