    "ins": "Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire. Alternatively, preheat an outdoor grill.\nCombine cauliflower, chickpeas, potatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, and onion in large bowl.\nCut two 2-foot sections of aluminum foil and place one on top of the other. Fold the edges together so the 2 pieces will stay together. Drizzle olive oil in the middle of the foil, leaving 4 to 5 inches on each side for folding. Place a few handfuls of the cauliflower mixture over the olive oil; season with curry powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon some vegetable broth on top. Repeat with more foil and remaining cauliflower mixture.\nPull the 2 longer sides of each foil packet together over the cauliflower mixture and fold over several times until you almost reach the center. Flatten down the sides and roll them up toward the center.\nPlace the packets to the side of the campfire using long tongs. Cook until cauliflower mixture feels tender when you press the packets with the tongs, 20 to 30 minutes.\nRemove packets from fire and let cool, about 5 minutes. Open from the top, leaving the rolled-up sides as-is, to create a bowl.",
