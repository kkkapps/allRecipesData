    "des": "\"My mother made this when I was small. I'm not much of a baker, so I use store bought pie shells - not the frozen type.  While not totally as wonderful as mom's crust, it's pretty darned close.  Note: if you don't have sweet onions available, I've found that steaming regular yellow onions works very well as a substitute. A great dish reheated as well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace one pie crust into a deep-dish pie pan. Layer the bottom with half of the onions and half of the cheese. Season to taste with pepper. Layer with the remaining onions and cheese; season with pepper. Pour milk over the pie filling. Place the remaining pie crust on top of the filling. Make small holes in the crust to allow steam to escape.\nBake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes. Remove, and let cool 15 minutes before serving.",
