    "des": "\"I was a young boy on 4-H in California and when it came time to do my first demonstration I chose my first love....cooking!\n This recipe is great for kids' taste buds, but can be 'Mitch'ed' up, as my wife would call it, to suit the more refined taste buds of the adults in the house. Serve on a paper plate with favorite potato chips or have Mom make your favorite macaroni or potato salad.\"",
    "ins": "Slice hot dogs length-wise leaving the skin intact to hold the two halves together.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat; cook hot dogs in the hot skillet until cooked through and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.\nArrange bread slices on a sheet of waxed paper; spread butter onto 1 side of each slice. Flip and butter the other sides. Place a slice of Cheddar cheese onto each of 4 bread slices; add pickle slices and 1 hot dog atop each cheese slice. Top each hot dog with a sourdough slice.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat; place sandwiches, 1 at a time, into the hot skillet and cook until cheese is melted and bread is toasted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add weight to the sandwiches by placing a heavy plate on them while cooking, if necessary. Slice sandwiches diagonally to serve.",
