    "des": "\"Very light, flaky cookies, always requested for showers and weddings. Frost with cream cheese icing when cool. Dough can be made days ahead.\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, mash the butter and flour together until smooth and creamy. Beat in the cream, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, until thoroughly combined.\nScrape the dough onto a large sheet of plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and chill at least 1 hour to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\nRoll the dough out 1/4 inch thick on a floured work surface, and cut into 2-inch circles with a cutter. Place sugar into a shallow bowl, and dip each cookie into the sugar on both sides. Place the cookies onto the prepared baking sheets.\nBake cookies in the preheated oven until the edges turn light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes on sheets before removing to cool completely on racks.",
