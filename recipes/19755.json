    "ins": "In a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef and onion, until meat is brown.  Stir in 3/4 teaspoon salt, a pinch of pepper, tomato sauce and cinnamon and cook 1 to 2 minutes more.  Set aside.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  Set aside.\nIn a medium saucepan, melt 1/4 cup butter over medium heat.  Dump in flour, all at once, and stir until a smooth roux is formed.  Pour in 2 1/2 cups milk, a little at a time, stirring until smooth.  Stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper and 1/4 cup Parmesan; bring to a boil, and stir until thickened.  Remove from heat.\nIn a small bowl, beat together eggs and 1 cup milk.  Set aside.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Place half the cooked macaroni in the baking dish and top with all of the beef mixture.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup grated Parmesan over the meat.  Place the remaining macaroni over the cheese.  Pour the egg mixture over the macaroni.  Cover all with the white sauce.\nIn a medium bowl, stir together bread cubes and melted butter, until bread is well coated.  Place bread cubes evenly over macaroni.\nBake 50 to 60 minutes, or until topping is golden brown.",
