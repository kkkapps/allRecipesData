Sprinkle with onion soup mix.\nBake in preheated oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 90 minutes. Remove roast from Dutch oven to a platter, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area  10 to 15 minutes before slicing.\nWhisk cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup beef broth in a bowl and stir into Dutch oven with mushrooms and pan drippings. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve over sliced beef.",
