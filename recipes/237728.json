    "des": "\"Since the weather is warming up two things come to mind: what am I going to make with all those sweet berries and how can I avoid turning on my oven? This dessert is so fast and easy and looks cooked because we brulee sugar on top of the mascarpone. I'm not a big dessert person but this is my idea of the perfect finish to that early summer dinner.\"",
    "ins": "Mix strawberries, blackberries, 1/3 cup sugar, and orange juice together in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 hours to overnight.\nStir mascarpone cheese, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.\nSpread mascarpone mixture over the top of each shortcake half; sprinkle about 1 teaspoon sugar over the top to cover. Caramelize the sugar using a kitchen torch, 20 to 30 seconds per shortcake. Place each shortcake in a shallow bowl and surround with berries and accumulated juices.",
