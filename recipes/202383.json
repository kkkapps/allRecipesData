Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 30 minutes.\nWhile the meatballs bake, bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook until tender but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.\nPour the spaghetti sauce in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook until hot, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the cooked meatballs and stir to coat. Ladle over the drained spaghetti and top with the grated Parmesan cheese to serve.",
