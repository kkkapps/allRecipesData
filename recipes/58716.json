    "ins": "Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.\nDrain potatoes, and transfer to a bowl. Add butter, and mash with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are starting to become smooth. Add milk and sour cream, and mix to your desired texture. Careful not to over mix the potatoes once they are creamy. Season with garlic, basil, salt and pepper.",
