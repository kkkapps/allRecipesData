    "des": "\"Sometimes called veal Marsala, this is the classic Italian dish made with thinly sliced veal scaloppine. A recipe typical of Sicily, where the best Marsala comes from. Serve with plenty of bread to mop up the sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Place veal between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface; pound to 1/4-inch thickness with the smooth side of a meat mallet. Pat dry with a paper towel and dust with flour on both sides.\nMelt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it starts to foam. Add veal; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Season with salt. Transfer veal to a plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.\nPour Marsala wine into the same skillet. Stir to scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes.\nStir water and cornstarch together in a small bowl until cornstarch dissolves. Stir into the Marsala wine in the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.\nReturn veal to the skillet; cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and serve topped with sauce.",
