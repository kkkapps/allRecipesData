    "des": "\"This miso-glazed recipe features Barramundi, a mild, flaky, white-fleshed fish that you'll probably be seeing more and more due to its reputation as a sustainable, eco-friendly seafood. It's showing up in grocery store frozen seafood cases, and chances are you'll run across some soon. If you do, buy it and make this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk miso paste, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and soy sauce together in a bowl until glaze is smooth.\nPlace barramundi fillets, rounded-side up, onto a plate; spread 1/2 of the glaze onto rounded side of fish.\nHeat oil over high heat in a nonstick skillet. Place fish, glazed-side down, in hot skillet and spread remaining glaze over other side; cook until slightly white around the edges, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip fish and cook until flaky and white, 1 to 2 minutes more.",
