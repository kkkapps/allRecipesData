    "des": "\"This tangy infusion was inspired by a combination of Indian, Egyptian, and Costa Rican wisdom for soothing the common cold. Make a pot in the morning when you are not feeling well and drink throughout the day, reheating by the mugful as needed. My husband and I keep these ingredients on hand throughout the winter just because we like it. For children, add a splash of orange juice to cool it down.\"",
    "ins": "Place honey, lemon juice, ginger, and cinnamon in a teapot or 4-cup glass measuring beaker with spout. Pour boiling water over mixture and stir well until honey is dissolved. Cover and let steep for 5 minutes. The ginger should sink to the bottom, but may be strained out while pouring into mug.",
