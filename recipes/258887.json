    "des": "\"If you've never tasted Algerian bread, then you should definitely give this very easy recipe a try. Known as Khobz el Dar, it requires no kneading, no special techniques, and only basic ingredients. The result is an incredibly soft bread, slightly sweet, that tastes like brioche. Absolutely delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Mix 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons semolina, 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, sugar, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk in oil, egg, and egg white. Stir in warm milk slowly until a liquid dough forms.\nCover the bowl with a plate or plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature until frothy, about 1 hour.\nStir in 2 3/4 cups flour with a wooden spoon until a sticky dough forms. Cover again and allow to rest for 30 minutes.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat.\nSprinkle 1 tablespoon flour over the dough and your hands. Mix dough, adding flour as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Shape into a round loaf and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with a towel and let rise for 1 hour in a warm place until loaf doubles in volume.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBeat egg yolk and water in a bowl with a fork; brush over the entire surface of the loaf. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sesame seeds on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.",
