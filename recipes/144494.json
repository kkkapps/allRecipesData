    "ins": "Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large deep pot or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and fry on all sides until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and stir to loosen any bits of food that are stuck to the bottom of the pot.\nPour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add carrots and peas, and season with cumin, paprika, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the chicken easily pulls away from the bone.\nHeat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry potatoes in the oil, stirring frequently, until tender. Adjust heat as needed to keep them from burning. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.\nTo serve, place a piece of chicken onto each plate, spoon some of the carrots and peas with the cooking liquid over it and top with a spoonful of fried potatoes.",
