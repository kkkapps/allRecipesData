    "ins": "Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces. Whisk the thin coconut milk and shrimp paste together in a bowl. Pour into a large pot with the onion, ginger, and pork; bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 5 minutes.\nAdd the green beans, calabash, and green chile pepper; cover again and continue cooking until the mixture is nearly dry, about 10 minutes.
