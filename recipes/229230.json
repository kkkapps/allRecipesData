    "des": "\"The nutty flavor of wild rice makes a great combo with dried apricots, pine nuts, and traditional ingredients. I combined some recipes and the result was eagerly consumed. When I made this I fully cooked the rice. This is a forgiving and flexible recipe. There are so many different things to add or substitute: walnuts, almonds, orange zest, dried cranberries, mushrooms, more bread, whatever you prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 8 cups chicken broth and wild rice to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until rice is partially tender, about 30 minutes.\nMix partially-cooked wild rice with chicken broth, cranberry-walnut bread, 1 cup chicken broth, celery, water chestnuts, pecans, pine nuts, onion, apple, apricots, and garlic together in a slow cooker.\nCook on Low until wild rice has softened and split, at least 40 more minutes.",
