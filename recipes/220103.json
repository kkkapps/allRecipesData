Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.\nTransfer the square cake onto a large platter.\nCut the round cake in half, then arrange the cut side of the cake along two edges of the square cake to create a heart shape.\nPoke several holes on the top of the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon or spatula.\nPour the sweetened condensed milk over the cake so that it runs into the holes; allow the milk to soak in.\nSpread the strawberry preserves on top of the cake.\nFold the cream cheese frosting into the whipped topping in a bowl until just incorporated.\nSpread the frosting over the top and sides of the cake.",
