    "des": "\"These green spinach noodles have a very interesting texture and flavor--but they taste better than store-bought noodles because they're fresh.  Use in soups, or serve alone; they are great either way.  This is an easy recipe, and you'll get lots of compliments because you made them yourself.\"",
    "ins": "Combine spinach and water in a saucepan.  Cover, and cook till spinach is very tender.  Cool slightly.\nPlace spinach and liquid in blender container.  Add egg and salt.  Cover, and blend till smooth.  Transfer to a bowl.  Add enough flour to make a stiff dough.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead  for 1 minute.  Roll very thin on a floured surface.  Let rest 20 minutes.  Roll up loosely.  Slice 1/4 inch wide.  Unroll.  Cut into desired lengths.  Spread out on a rack to dry for 2 hours.",
