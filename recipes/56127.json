    "ins": "Use a long serrated knife to cut the angel food cake in half, width-wise. Hollow out each cake half; use the bits of cake to fill the hole in the center, making 2 cake bowls.\nWhisk the pudding mix, whipped topping, milk, and almond extract in a large bowl; beat well. Pour pudding mixture evenly into the cake bowls.\nEvenly spoon cherry pie filling around the top edge of each cake. Chill cakes in refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.",
