    "des": "\"All the fresh greens of the herbs and melon of this easy side dish are refreshing to both the eye and the palate! The melon can be chopped bite-sized to be a salad or side, or smaller to be used as a relish or condiment. This dish is also great for a change of pace on the brunch buffet! This works well also with Crenshaw melon.\"",
