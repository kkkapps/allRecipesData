    "des": "\"I tried this delicious concoction one night as I was rushing to throw some dinner together and needed to use what was left in the fridge. The key to this recipe is to make sure your eggs are very buttery, soft, and highly seasoned so they don't disappear among the other toppings! This recipe is very adaptable to your personal tastes, but you want a balance of ingredients that don't overwhelm the delicate eggs. Let them be the star.\"",
    "ins": "Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in eggs; cook and stir until eggs are set but still soft, about 3 minutes. Season with garlic powder and chili powder. Stir in Mexican cheese blend until melted, about 1 minute.\nPlace tortilla chips on a large plate. Spoon eggs on top. Garnish with salsa, guacamole, sour cream, and black olives.",
