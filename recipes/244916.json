    "des": "\"This is the easiest recipe for rustic bread I've ever seen. Luckily it is also the yummiest. Feel free to halve the recipe if you only want one loaf, but beware: it's so addictive you may wish you'd just baked both loaves.\"",
    "ins": "Mix water, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl until mixture becomes foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir flour into yeast mixture until well incorporated. The dough will be loose and look wet. Cover bowl loosely with a damp towel and let sit for about 5 hours.\nShape dough into 2 loaves using damp hands. Place loaves on a cornmeal-dusted work surface and score the tops a few times with a sharp knife. Allow loaves to double in size, 30 to 60 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place loaves on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven, spraying the surface of the dough occasionally with water, until golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
