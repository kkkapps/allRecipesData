    "des": "\"Don't get this cake confused with the traditional fruit cake. It is so much more. This recipe has been handed down for 3 generations and I now want to share it with all of you. Don't get nervous with all the ingredients. Everything gets hand-mixed in 1 great big bowl.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x8-inch baking pans.\nBring water and raisins to a boil in a saucepan; cook until raisins are plump, about 2 minutes. Drain and cool raisins; reserve raisin water.\nMix 3 cups flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Place pecans and 2 tablespoons flour in a resealable plastic bag; close and shake bag until pecans are coated. Pour pecans into a colander and shake off excess flour.\nWhisk sugar, oil, eggs, and cooled raisin water together in a bowl; fold in candied fruit. Stir flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, into sugar mixture until fully incorporated; fold in raisins and pecans. Fill the prepared pans a little over half full.\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Lower temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C); bake until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 more hour.",
