    "des": "\"This is my mother's recipe and is a combination of my two grandmothers' potato salad recipes.  It leans a little to the Irish side.  My mother's maiden name is McClain and her mother's maiden name is McBee. I like to make this the night before so the flavors will blend.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to cool.\nRemove skins from potatoes and cut into chunks. Place in a large bowl.\nLightly stir celery, red onion, eggs, black olives, green olives, dill pickle relish, sweet pickle relish, and paprika with potatoes until thoroughly combined.\nMix in mustard, vinegar, and mayonnaise; stir lightly until all ingredients are coated and moist. If salad isn't moist enough, stir up to 1/2 cup more mayonnaise into salad.\nSeason with salt and ground black pepper to taste. For best flavor, make the day before and refrigerate overnight.",
