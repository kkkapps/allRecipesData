    "des": "\"This is a wonderful dish that I had while on the coast of Spain. It should be enjoyed with a good white wine or sangria, and warm crusty bread.  I could not find a recipe that came close to what I had in Spain so I came up with this recipe myself. It is a big hit with family and friends. Enjoy. This can be made ahead of time and the recipe can doubled.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cayenne pepper, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to high, and add the shrimp and white wine. Bring to a boil, and cook until the shrimp are no longer transparent in the center, about 3 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and sweet paprika before serving.",
