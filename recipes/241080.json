    "des": "\"Any decent Big Game snack table has to have a few substantial dips, and this loaded baked potato dip, with its three pounds of bacon, is nothing if not substantial. It's also shaped like a football, which of course has been proven to taste better to people drinking beer than dips in a bowl. Speaking of beer, I think this will pair nicely with something cheap, domestic, and in a can.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Pour bacon into a colander set over a bowl to drain and cool to room temperature; finely chop cooled bacon.\nStir 6 cups sour cream, Cheddar cheese, 1 cup chopped green onion, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a large bowl until well-mixed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.\nSpread sour cream mixture into a football shape in the center of a serving platter. Spread bacon over the top to resemble the outside of a football.\nPlace 1/4 cup sour cream in a piping bag; pipe 1 line on each end of the \"football\" and 1 set of \"laces\" down the center of the \"football\". Spread 1 1/2 cups chopped green onion around the \"football\" to resemble \"grass\".",
