Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.\nThoroughly rinse the chicken thighs, drumsticks, and wings; pat dry with paper towels. Arrange the chicken in a baking dish; season with salt and pepper.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Pour the pineapple chunks around the chicken pieces; brush the chicken liberally with the sauce and return to the oven for 30 minutes, brushing with sauce every 10 minutes or so.",
