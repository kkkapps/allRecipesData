Stir everything with a wooden spoon until you have a soft dough.\nPlace the dough on a lightly floured surface.   Knead for five minutes, until smooth and elastic.\nDivide the dough in half, and roll each half into a ball.  Place both on a baking sheet.  Cut crisscross designs in the tops, and cover with a kitchen towel.  Let rise until double in size.\nBake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 35 minutes.",
