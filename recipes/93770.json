    "des": "\"Tender pork combined with apples and raisins is a family favorite for us!  I've substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, and that was so good too!  Recipe can be altered if serving more people.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry pork chops on each side until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking dish, reserving the drippings in the skillet. Cover pork chops with apple slices and sprinkle with sugar.\nStir the flour into the fat in the skillet until smooth. Whisk in the water and vinegar. Simmer over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Add raisins and pour over the pork chops. Cover the baking dish with a lid or aluminum foil.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove the aluminum foil for the last 20 minutes of cooking.",
