    "des": "\"Chile Rellenos without all the mess, but all the flavor. Good for company!  Excellent for a buffet table!  Variations include adding small chopped cooked shrimp or chopped cooked crab to the filling for an excellent brunch dish. Monterey jack cheese may be used instead of Mexican-style cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Beat the eggs.  Combine with milk, cilantro, bell pepper, spices, cheese, chiles, and tomatillo.  Pour filling into the pie shell.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool to room temperature. Garnish each individual piece of pie with a dollop of sour cream and drizzle with your favorite salsa!",
