Contains all the scrumptiousness of an exclusively autumn dessert, yet satisfies the everyday desire of all that is chocolaty and filling. Sprinkle more nuts on top of batter before baking if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish or two 9x5-inch loaf pans with shortening.\nWhisk cake flour, pudding mix, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat pumpkin, white sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Slowly spoon flour mixture into pumpkin mixture and mix until batter is smooth; stir in walnuts and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared dish and sprinkle raw sugar over batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.",
