    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSeason the steak with salt and pepper to taste.  Dredge in the flour and shake off the excess.  Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.  Brown the steaks in the oil, then transfer to a large, shallow casserole dish.  Sprinkle the garlic, onion, and green pepper over top, pour in water, and wrap with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven until steak is tender and vegetables are soft, about 1 1/2 hours.",
