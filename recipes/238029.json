    "ins": "Stir buttermilk and hot sauce together in a bowl; add chicken and stir to coat. Marinate chicken in refrigerator at least 1 hour.\nLightly grease a baking sheet.\nMix panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika in large shallow bowl.\nRemove chicken from marinade, shaking pieces to remove excess moisture. Discard the remaining marinade.\nGently press chicken pieces into the panko mixture to coat. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Arrange breaded chicken onto prepared baking sheet.\nRefrigerate breaded chicken at least 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nLightly coat chicken pieces with cooking spray.\nBake chicken in preheated oven until browning on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Flip pieces and continue baking until the chicken is cooked through and the coating is crisp, 15 to 20 minutes more.",
