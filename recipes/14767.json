    "des": "\"This recipe is what I reach for when I'm tired and don't want to stand over the stove for hours, but still want to serve a really delicious dinner! A bonus is that it's also a lower calorie entree the way I make it. This dish can also be made with chicken instead of pork; either whole pieces, or chunks, simply adjust cooking time accordingly. Serve with rice, pasta or mashed potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onions and garlic and saute until translucent. Add pork chops and brown about 4 to 6 minutes each side, stirring often to avoid burning onions and garlic.\nMeanwhile, in a separate bowl, whisk together soup and broth. Pour soup mixture over browned chops, stirring well to loosen onions and garlic and to deglaze skillet. Reduce heat and gently simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring and turning chops occasionally, until chops are cooked through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.",
