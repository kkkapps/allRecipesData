    "des": "\"I learned how to make this dish from a family friend's mother. It's a favorite hearty Lithuanian potato dish that's rich in tradition and taste. Make sure you have helpers while grating your potatoes so they will get done quickly and not turn brown! Sour cream is a traditional topping, but it's delicious as is. To re-heat, slice and fry in a pan with a little butter until golden brown on both sides.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nCook and stir bacon, onion, and butter in a large skillet over medium heat until onions are translucent and bacon is cooked through but not crispy, 5 to 10 minutes; cool.\nPlace grated potatoes in a large bowl. Add bacon mixture, evaporated milk, eggs, farina, salt, and pepper to potatoes; stir to combine. Pour potato mixture into prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until top is golden brown, 1 hour.",
