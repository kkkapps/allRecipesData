    "des": "\"These muffins are very moist and full of spice. Whole wheat flour adds fiber without taking away any flavor. Try these for breakfast or a wholesome snack.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners, or generously grease with cooking spray.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each one. Stir in the molasses. Combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, and powdered buttermilk; stir into the molasses mixture alternately with the water. Mix just until blended. Fold in raisins. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top of the muffins spring back when lightly pressed. Cool for about 10 minutes in the pan before removing to cooling racks.",
