    "des": "\"Simple and super easy; better if chilled overnight. I have tried many others but always gravitate back to my basic spud salad. Use a combination of red, russet, and new potatoes, peeled, or use scrubbed new potatoes with the skins on.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until tender yet still firm, about 20 minutes. Drain and refrigerate until cool, about 30 minutes.\nPlace eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water; peel and dice eggs.\nChop potatoes and place into a large bowl. Stir eggs, celery, and green onions into potatoes; mix in mayonnaise and mustard. Season with salt and pepper.",
