    "ins": "Grease bottoms and sides of each ramekin with 1 teaspoon butter.\nCombine shredded onion and carrots in a large bowl. Add 1/2 cup melted butter; mix thoroughly. Stir in Parmesan cheese and garlic powder; mix well to combine.\nCombine eggs, egg yolks, and sugar in another large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually blend in enough flour to make a smooth batter. Beat in onion mixture on low speed until thoroughly incorporated. Fold in mozzarella cheese.\nDivide batter among ramekins, filling them almost to the top. Refrigerate until firm, 1 to 3 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until souffle batter puffs up above the edge of the ramekins, about 30 minutes.",
