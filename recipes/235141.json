    "des": "\"This chicken recipe is great with escarole and/or pasta. The lemon/wine/butter sauce can be drizzled not only on your escarole, but also the pasta. This is a family favorite.\"",
    "ins": "Beat eggs, Parmesan cheese, and parsley together in a shallow bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl.\nGently press chicken breast halves into flour to coat and shake off any excess flour. Dip chicken into egg mixture.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Remove chicken from skillet and reduce heat to medium.\nStir butter and garlic into hot skillet. Cook and stir until garlic is fragrant and soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Return chicken breasts to the skillet and drizzle lemon juice over the chicken.\nPour sherry into skillet; stir water and chicken bouillon cube into sherry mixture. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nPlace a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add escarole, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Serve escarole topped with chicken and pan sauce.",
