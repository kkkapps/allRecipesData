    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt over steak cubes; cook and stir meat in the hot oil with onion and garlic until meat is seared, about 5 minutes; reduce heat to medium; cook and stir until meat is browned, about 3 more minutes. Remove steak pieces and set aside.\nStir tomato sauce and tomato paste into same pot; mix in okra, water, coriander, white pepper, and cumin. Bring to a boil; season with additional salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer until okra is tender, 30 to 45 minutes; return pieces of beef to the bamia. Simmer until flavors are blended, about 10 minutes; garnish with slices of jalapeno pepper.",
