    "des": "\"This recipe is great hot or cold. I invented it in grad school when I had no time to cook. It's a quick and easy one dish recipe. I use it as a side dish for nice meals or a full meal for lunch. You can make it in 5 minutes or less and eat immediately. For extra protein you can add chicken breast.\"",
    "ins": "Place the couscous and cranberries in a heatproof bowl. Pour in the boiling water, and stir with a fork. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set aside 5 to 10 minutes.\nFluff the couscous with a fork, and fold in the cucumber and feta cheese. Season to taste with balsamic vinaigrette and salt.",
