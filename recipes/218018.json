    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the cake mix into a mixing bowl, and work in the butter until the cake mix resembles corn meal. Spread the berries into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish, and sprinkle evenly with the crumb topping.\nBake in the preheated oven until the berries are tender, and the crumb topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.",
