    "des": "\"What a difference adding meat and red wine makes to everyday pasta sauce! Leftover roast beef and Holland House Red Cooking Wine work wonders to boost flavor. Add both to your favorite jarred pasta sauce or make our hearty pasta sauce -- a Bolognese-style ragu that is traditionally served with wide noodles.\"",
    "ins": "Coarsely chop, or shred by hand, enough cooked roast beef to make 1-1/2 cups. If meat is cold, cut into chunks and warm slightly in microwave to make hand-shredding easier.\nHeat olive oil in a 4-quart pot and gently cook garlic, basil, oregano and rosemary about 3 minutes. Stir in the 1-1/2 cups beef and tomato paste. Add tomato sauce, red cooking wine, brown sugar and cinnamon or nutmeg, stirring until smooth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 30-40 minutes.\nRemove from heat; stir in half & half. Serve over pasta, sprinkled with cheese if desired.",
