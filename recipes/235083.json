    "des": "\"Nothing beats a baked noodle melody with sweet raisins, cinnamon, sugar, and a mess of other great tasting add-ins.  This was my request every year at our family gatherings. Sometimes I also add 3 ounces of maraschino cherries and an 8-ounce can of crushed pineapple.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter an 8x8-inch baking dish.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.\nWhisk milk, sour cream, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup softened butter, raisins, eggs, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl. Mix noodles into the milk mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish.\nMix corn flakes, 2 tablespoons melted butter, 2 tablespoons white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over noodle mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until kugel is set in the middle, about 1 1/2 hours. Cut into 2-inch squares.",
