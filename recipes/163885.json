    "ins": "Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C). Soak the wooden sticks in water so they will not burn easily.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the flour, self-rising flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg, buttermilk and lard. Stir until smooth, then set aside to rest briefly.\nWhile the batter is resting, insert a stick up into the center of each hot dog to use as a handle. Pat hot dogs dry with a paper towel to help the batter stick.\nDip each hot dog into the batter and allow the excess to drip off. If the batter is not sticking, roll the hot dogs in a little bit of flour first. Fry a few at a time in the hot oil until golden brown and heated through, 5 to 6 minutes. If your hot dogs are very brown on the outside, and cold on the inside, your oil is too hot. Adjust temperature if needed.",
