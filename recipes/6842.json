    "des": "\"An all-time Philippine favorite. The creamy and sticky texture makes this recipe an irresistible one. Use any type of semi-soft or hard grated cheese, such as cheddar, that suits your taste.\"",
    "ins": "NOTE:  Cassava, also known as Manioc, tapioca or yucca, can be found in Filipino or Latin American food stores.  Usually sold frozen and grated.  Mix together the cassava with the coconut milk, melted butter and eggs.  Stir in the white sugar, salt, vanilla, cheese and lemon rind.\nPour batter into a 9x5 inch loaf pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 C) for 30-35 minutes or until done.\nTo Make Topping:  Put 2 cups coconut milk, condensed milk, flour, and some grated cheese in a saucepan and boil, stirring constantly.  When thick, add the slightly beaten egg yolks.  Cook for two minutes.  Spread on top of the cooked cassava and bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for ten minutes or until golden brown.",
