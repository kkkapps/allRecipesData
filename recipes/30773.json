    "des": "\"My grandmother, Margaret Pokorny, immigrated here from what was, then, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This is one of her recipes which I have adapted for easier cooking. Serve with spaetzle and cucumber salad, and plenty of bread to sop up the gravy.\"",
    "ins": "In a Dutch oven over medium high heat, sear roast until browned on all sides. Scatter chopped carrots, celery and onions over and around roast. Add vinegar and water, and season with bay leaf and salt.\nReduce heat to low, and cook for 2 to 3 hours. Remove roast to a cutting board, and slice thinly. Remove bay leaf, then stir sour cream into gravy until blended. Return sliced meat to Dutch oven, and simmer for 15 minutes.",
