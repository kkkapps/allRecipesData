    "des": "\"These tasty vegan energy bars taste just like full-fat, non-vegan oatmeal cookies. Completely irresistible. They are great as breakfast bars with coffee, as an in-between meal snack to keep you going, or a healthy dessert! Once you try them, you will never bother with non-vegan oatmeal cookies again!\"",
