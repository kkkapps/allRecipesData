    "des": "\"This is a fun dip that is both sweet and spicy. I got the recipe by varying other cranberry salsa and dip recipes I have found. I got the idea of the fusion of oil from a friend. There are many ideas for use and a great item to take along when you want to surprise your friends with something they probably have not tried. Serve with Triscuits\u00c2\u00ae, pita chips, or crackers.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a saucepan over medium heat; add oil. Stir cranberries into hot oil and cook until cranberries absorb most of oil, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix sugar, water, jalapeno peppers, lemon juice, cilantro, and salt into cranberries; cook until reduced and softened, 10 to 15 more minutes. Add more water if needed.\nPulse cranberry mixture in a food processor or blender until very smooth; cool completely.\nStir cooled cranberry mixture and cream cheese together in a bowl until smooth and creamy.",
