    "des": "\"This recipe has been in my family for years. It was my grandmother's. The peas are whole, not like baby food creamed peas! They simmer in bacon grease, evaporated milk, flour, salt and pepper. Very creamy and homemade and they even taste great heated up the next day.\"",
    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from pan, crumble bacon, and reserve.\nStir peas into bacon grease left in skillet. Cook on low heat until peas are warm. Stir together flour, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour in evaporated milk and whisk until smooth. Stir milk mixture into peas; cook over medium heat until heated through and thickened. Stir in bacon.",
