    "des": "\"We attended a county fair in Wales and the ladies of the local church were baking and selling these.  We asked for the recipe and they graciously shared it with us.  This has been converted to US  standard.  They are delicious and not as sweet as some of our style cookies. Dried currants can be used in place of the raisins.\"",
    "ins": "Sift flour, baking powder and salt into bowl. Put in butter and lard and mix until resembles fine breadcrumbs.  Stir in sugar and currants or raisins.  Beat the eggs lightly and add to flour mixture with just enough milk to make a firm dough similar to shortcrust pastry.\nChill dough 1 to 2 hours.\nRoll the dough to 1/4 inch on floured surface and cut with 3 inch rounds. Bake the cakes on a greased  griddle or frying pan (I use my electric skillet with just a little non-stick spray) over low heat until golden brown.  Cool and sprinkle with sugar.    These also freeze well.",
