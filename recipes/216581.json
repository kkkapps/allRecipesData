    "des": "\"Here's an easy, reliable way to ensure a moist and flavorful turkey...simply baste the turkey with herb-seasoned chicken stock during roasting.  When the turkey is done, use a bit more stock to make a quick and savory gravy.\"",
    "ins": "Remove the package of giblets and neck from the turkey cavity. Rinse the turkey with cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Tie the ends of the drumsticks together.\nPlace the turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.  Brush the turkey with the oil.  Season with the salt and black pepper.  Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, not touching the bone.\nStir the stock, lemon juice, basil, thyme and 1/8 teaspoon additional black pepper in a large bowl.  Reserve 1 3/4 cups stock mixture for the gravy.  Pour the remaining stock mixture over the turkey.\nRoast at 325 degrees F for 3 hours or until the thermometer reads 165 degrees F., basting occasionally with the pan drippings.  Begin checking for doneness after 2 1/2 hours of the roasting time.\nRemove the turkey from the pan, cover and keep warm.  Spoon off any fat and pour off all but 1 1/2 cups pan drippings.\nStir the reserved stock mixture and the flour in a medium bowl until the mixture is smooth.  Add the flour mixture to the pan.  Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture boils and thickens, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Season, if desired.  Serve the gravy with the turkey.",
