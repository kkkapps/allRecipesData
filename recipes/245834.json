    "ins": "Line a 5 to 6-quart slow cooker with a Reynolds(R) Slow Cooker Liner. Open slow cooker liner and place it inside a slow cooker bowl. Fit liner snugly against the bottom and sides of bowl; pull top of liner over rim of bowl.\nPlace chicken in slow cooker. Top with 1 can of enchilada sauce.\nCover the slow cooker and cook on low for 4-6 hours.\nCarefully remove lid to allow steam to escape. Remove the chicken and place on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred, or use your stand mixer to help speed up the process. Place the chicken in the mixer and turn the mixer to low for about 30 seconds. Cool slow cooker completely; remove liner and toss.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with the Reynolds Wrap(R) Non-Stick Foil, facing the dull side up.\nLine the foil with tortilla chips and top with the chicken, black beans and shredded cheese. Bake for about 10 minutes, until the cheese is all melted. Remove nachos from oven and top with sliced olives, salsa, avocados, banana peppers and any other fixings of your choosing!",
