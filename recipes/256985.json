    "des": "\"This soda bread uses more plain flour than whole-meal to give it a lighter color and softer texture. I add sunflower seeds and use a coarse whole-meal to give it a little bite.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Dust a baking sheet lightly with flour.\nMix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sunflower seeds, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in buttermilk; mix until a soft dough forms.\nTurn dough out on a floured work surface and knead until smooth. Shape into a round loaf; cut an X in the top. Transfer to the floured baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, about 40 minutes. Let cool for 30 minutes before slicing.",
