    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Butter the bottom and sides of an 8 inch square baking dish with the melted butter.\nToss bread with the chopped strawberries, and place into the prepared pan.  Beat the eggs, milk, cream, strawberry preserves, sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl until frothy.  Pour over the bread and lightly press down with a spatula until the bread has absorbed the milk mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly tapped.",
