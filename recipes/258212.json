    "des": "\"This relish spices up everything from grilled cheese sandwiches to burgers and hot dogs. Or, for an easy appetizer, spoon some over a block of cream cheese and serve with crackers.\"",
    "ins": "Wearing rubber or latex gloves, trim tops off chiles. Working in batches, pulse chiles, bell peppers, and onion in a food processor until chopped into fine bits, about 1 minute per batch. Transfer to a nonreactive 3-quart pot.\nStir sugar, vinegar, and salt into chile mixture and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring more frequently toward end of cooking to prevent scorching, until thickened, 20 to 30 minutes.\nPour or ladle relish into clean, wide-mouth, half-pint jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Wipe rims clean with a damp paper towel. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.\nApply clean lids. Enjoy immediately, store in fridge 2 to 3 weeks, or freeze up to 6 months.",
