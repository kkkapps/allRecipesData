    "des": "\"This recipe  is from my great grandmother.  I entered these in our County Fair.  There were over 60 entries in the drop cookie category.  I received 2nd place. Pretty darn good, huh? My great grandmother would have been so proud. You can make sour milk by combining 1/2 cup of milk with 1 teaspoon vinegar and allow to set 10 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets.\nIn a medium size mixing  bowl, mix together 3 teaspoons baking powder and 3 1/4 cups flour.\nBeat together brown sugar and shortening then add eggs, orange rind and vanilla.

Let cool and frost cookies.\nTo Make Frosting:  Mix together powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon butter and enough orange juice mixed in to make it able to spread over cooled cookies.",
