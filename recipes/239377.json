    "ins": "Mix flour and baking powder together in a small bowl. Mix milk, egg, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil together in a large bowl. Stir flour mixture into milk mixture until batter is smooth. Set aside to allow batter to thicken, about 1 minute.\nHeat about 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, add blueberries, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining oil and batter.",
