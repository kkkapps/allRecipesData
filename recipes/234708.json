    "des": "\"A wonderful roast beef slow cooker recipe that makes it own delicious gravy while the beef and veggies are cooking. Try also with dry onion-and-mushroom soup mix in place of the onion for added flavor. Feel free to change the vegetables to make the dish to the liking of you and your family. You can add sliced mushrooms, sliced sweet onion or pearl onions, whatever strikes your fancy. I found a good ratio is 3 cubed potatoes and about 2 handfuls of additional vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear roast in hot oil until browned completely, about 2 minutes per side.\nSpread potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker. Layer baby carrots atop the potatoes and green beans atop the carrots. Place the roast atop the layers of vegetables.\nMix cream of mushroom soup, water, and dry onion soup mix together in a bowl; pour over the roast and vegetables.\nCook on Low 8 to 10 hours.",
