    "ins": "Place the peanuts into a food processor and process for a minute or so. The peanuts should be forming a ball. Continue processing, and check frequently to see if the peanut ball has oil on top. If not, keep mixing. If it does, pour in the vegetable oil, and process for 30 seconds, or until creamy. Add the honey, and process for another 30 seconds. If you want even creamier peanut butter, add another tablespoon of oil. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.",
