    "des": "\"This bright summer salad showcases farm fresh local produce such as tomatoes, corn, cilantro, garlic, jalapenos, and onion, as well as its star ingredient: fresh edamame. Experimenting with different ways to prepare the delicious edamame we grow on my family farm, I stumbled upon this cold salad combination and it has been a huge hit. I'm sure that frozen produce can be substituted for many of the fresh ingredients this recipe calls for; however, you can't beat the taste of fresh local produce. Remember to frequent area farmer's markets whenever the season permits!\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large pot half full with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add corn cobs and return to a boil. Cook until corn is softened but still firm, about 5 minutes. Remove from pot; rinse with cold water until cool enough to handle. Cut kernels from the cob with a sharp knife; place into a large mixing bowl.\nPlace edamame into a large pot; pour in 2- to 3-inches of water. Cover; bring to a boil. Steam edamame until shells are softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain; let cool. Squeeze the center of each pod to pop the edamame out into a bowl.\nMix edamame, black beans, tomatoes, and onion into the corn kernels; season with salt and pepper.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place jalapeno skin side up on the baking sheet.\nRoast jalapeno in the preheated oven until outer skin is charred, about 5 minutes; mince with a sharp knife.\nCombine olive oil, garlic, roasted jalapeno, lemon juice, cilantro, balsamic vinegar, and cumin in a bowl; whisk until well mixed. Pour over vegetable mixture; stir until vegetables are coated.",
