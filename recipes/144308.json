    "des": "\"White rice is the main side dish made in Brazil.  This is the way my mom would make it and taught my sister and I.  What makes this so different is that we fry it in oil with minced onion and garlic before adding water.  You can also use part water, part chicken broth.  The secret is to not let it overcook because it should come out loose and not sticky.\"",
    "ins": "Place the rice in a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold water; set aside.\nHeat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook the onion in the oil for one minute. Stir in the garlic and cook until the garlic is golden brown. Add the rice and salt and cook and stir until the rice begins to brown. Pour hot water over rice mixture and stir. Reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan, and allow to simmer until the water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.",
