Stir chicken bouillon granules and 1 cup water together in a saucepan, and bring to a boil, stirring until the granules have dissolved. Mix in the pureed chilies. Bring the sauce back to a boil over medium-low heat.\nIn a bowl, whisk the remaining 1/2 cup of warm water with the flour until the mixture is smooth; whisk the flour slurry into the sauce. Bring the mixture back to a boil, whisking constantly until smooth and thickened, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in onion powder and cayenne pepper. Serve hot.",
