    "ins": "Stir the honey into the persimmon puree to taste; it should be very sweet, since it will be mixed with the unsweetened cream.\nWith an electric mixer, whip the cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold the persimmon-honey mixture into the whipped cream. Divide the cream into parfait glasses, serving dishes, or a baked pie shell. Serve immediately, chill, or freeze for a frozen mousse.",
