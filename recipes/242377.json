    "des": "\"Honey and red jalapeno jelly in the glaze and Chinese 5 spice powder in the rub provide Asian-inspired flavor to these tender grilled ribs.\"",
    "ins": "About one hour before smoking, coat both sides of ribs with a little vegetable oil and sprinkle with Chinese 5 spice. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\nHeat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 230 to 250 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.\nPlace the ribs, meaty side down, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.\nRemove ribs from grill. Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.\nMeanwhile, make the glaze. Combine all ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes, stirring frequently.\nRemove ribs from grill and unwrap. Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with honey red pepper glaze.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the glaze is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more glaze.",
