    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, and rinse with cold water.\nPlace the bacon into a Dutch oven or enameled casserole dish over medium heat, and cook until just starting to soften, 3 to 4 minutes; add the ground beef, onion, and green pepper, and cook and stir until the meat is browned and the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Drain excess fat. Mix in the cooked noodles, mushrooms, and diced tomatoes until thoroughly combined. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the mixture, and pour the tomato juice over the casserole.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbling, about 1 hour.",
