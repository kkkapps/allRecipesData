    "des": "\"This is a German recipe from my Grandmother. It's cabbage that is lightly browned in butter and mixed with egg noodles and browned lightly for a wonderful, hearty, and fast dish.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the egg noodles in the boiling water until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.\nWhile the noodles cook, melt the butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add the cabbage to the melted butter; season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until the cabbage begins to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the drained noodles into the cabbage; cook and stir until the noodles begin to brown, about 5 minutes.",
