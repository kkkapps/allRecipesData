    "des": "\"Made with quick-rise yeast, this is a sweeter, richer challah that lends itself especially well to Rosh Hashanah or other holiday uses. It is  quicker and easier than a standard double-rise recipe, so it's great for those afternoons when you're in a challah of a hurry. Challah was meant to be torn and not sliced. B'tayevon!\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, blend together warm water, melted margarine, sugar, and 3 beaten eggs\nIn a large bowl, mix together yeast, salt, and 7 cups of the flour. Gradually stir in liquid ingredients, and mix until dough holds together.\nKnead dough on a floured surface with remaining flour until smooth.\nSplit the dough into 2 large pieces. Split the 2 large pieces into 3 pieces each. Roll each third into a rope 3/4 inch thick and braid 3 strands together. Repeat. Place shaped dough onto greased cookie sheets. Brush dough with remaining beaten egg.  Add poppy or sesame seeds, if desired. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size.\nBake in a preheated 325 degree F(165 degrees C) oven for 20 to 30 minutes.",
