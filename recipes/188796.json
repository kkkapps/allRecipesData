    "des": "\"I am asked to bring these 'trucker beans' to almost every summer bbq! Rich, meaty and satisfying. These beans make a great side dish, are perfect to bring to a pot luck picnic, or hearty enough to be eaten as a meal.\"",
    "ins": "Rinse the beans, and place in a very large pot.  Cover beans with water, add the bay leaf, and bring to a boil.  Simmer until all of the water is absorbed, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Remove the bay leaf.\nPlace the chopped bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate.  Return the skillet to the heat, and add the ground beef; cook until the beef is cooked through and browned, about 5 minutes.  Drain fat.\nCombine the beans, bacon, ground beef, sliced kielbasa, onion, green pepper, red pepper, chicken broth, barbeque sauce, Worcestershire sauce, honey, maple syrup, bourbon, and mustard in the crock of a slow cooker,  and stir well to combine. Turn the slow cooker to Low heat, and cook until the beans are tender, 8 to 10 hours.",
