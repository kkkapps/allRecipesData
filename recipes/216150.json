Sprinkle with garlic powder and chili powder. Drizzle with the vegetable oil, and toss until evenly coated. Spread onto the prepared pan in a single layer.\nBake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until the hominy is crisp and dry, 40 to 50 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.",
