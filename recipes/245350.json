    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nUnroll crescent roll dough onto a silicone baking mat or lightly greased work surface and separate into 4 rectangles; firmly press diagonal perforations with your fingers to smooth them out.\nMix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture evenly over rectangles.\nRoll each rectangle into a log starting from the longer side; cut each log into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange mini cinnamon rolls close to one another on the baking sheet.\nBake the mini cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 13 minutes. Transfer baked rolls to a plate and set aside to cool for 1 minute.\nCombine the confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl to make a smooth icing. Pour icing over warm rolls.",
