    "des": "\"This is a fairly quick and absolutely delicious way to have very juicy, so-tender-you-can-cut-them-with-a-fork pork chops. I use boneless chops that are 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick for this and keep the other sides simple; it's great with baby red potatoes or rice. I happened to have really great chops, and some fabulous veggies on hand so I kept the seasoning simple. I used a rather strong Viognier for the wine, but you could use any good white.\"",
    "ins": "Season pork chops with seasoned salt and lemon-pepper seasoning.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add seasoned pork chops; cook until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Pour 1/2 cup wine and water over the pork chops; bring to a simmer. Cook until chops are no longer pink in the center and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chops to serving plates.\nStir oyster mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and garlic into the skillet. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until onion softens and all the liquid evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup wine, tomatoes, and butter. Cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.\nServe mushroom and tomato mixture over pork chops.",
