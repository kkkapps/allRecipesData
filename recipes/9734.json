    "des": "\"This recipe makes over 12 dozen small cookies... a great substitution for holiday fruitcake . You can substitute rum-soaked dried apricots and dates instead of glacee'd cherries and figs for an equally tasty cookie.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine fruits, honey, sherry, lemon juice, salt and walnuts.  Cover and marinate overnight.\nCream together with butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Add egg and mix well.  Combine the flour, salt and cloves; gradually blend into the butter mixture. Blend in the fruit and nut mixture\nLightly flour work surface and divide dough  into 2 equal portions.  Roll into logs and wrap in plastic wrap or waxed paper.  Place dough in freezer for at least an hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut logs into thin rounds and place on cookie sheet spaced at least 1 inch apart.\nBake 10 to 13 minutes  in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.",
