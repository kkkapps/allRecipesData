    "des": "\"If you first cook the pasta, and then use the same pot to cook the beans, you will only need one pot and a casserole dish to make this meal. To save time, cook the pasta and the beans in different pots at the same time, and use prepared pesto instead of fresh basil and Parmesan.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until done. Drain, and set aside. Meanwhile mince basil and garlic with Parmesan cheese. Transfer to a medium bowl, and mix with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Mix in ricotta.\nIn a saucepan, cook onions with thyme and bay leaf in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Stir in beans and balsamic vinegar, and simmer for 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine beans, tomatoes, and pasta in a well oiled 2 quart casserole dish. Place spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture in the pasta and beans, and press down to cover. In a small bowl, moisten bread crumbs with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sprinkle over casserole.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.",
