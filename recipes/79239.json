    "des": "\"This slow cooker recipe creates a wonderful, mild, sweet and spicy flavor and works best with frozen chicken.  Serve over rice or couscous, or with crusty bread for dipping.\"",
    "ins": "Place the chicken breasts in the bottom of a slow cooker. They can still be frozen if you have those on hand. Layer the sausage, green pepper, onion, garlic, apples, and cranberries over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley and chives. Pour the chicken stock over everything, and season with salt and pepper. Cover, and cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.",
