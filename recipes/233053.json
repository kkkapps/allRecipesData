I've never actually had the patience to chill this and always end up serving it right away. It's a huge hit!\n Serve with your favorite crackers.\"",

Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for flavors to blend, at least 2 hours to overnight.\nArrange cream cheese halves on 2 serving dishes; spoon tapenade over cream cheese.",
