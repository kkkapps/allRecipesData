    "des": "\"A nice mildly spicy cornbread recipe. Great with chili. You may want to adjust the amount of cayenne and hot sauce to taste. For this recipe I use cast iron pans that have 5 small corn cob shapes in them, but any cast iron frying pan will do.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven and skillet to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cayenne pepper. Cut in shortening until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. In a small bowl, beat together milk, eggs and hot pepper sauce. Stir milk mixture into the flour/cornmeal mixture until just blended. Remove hot skillet from oven, spray with non-stick cooking spray and pour batter into skillet.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of loaf comes out clean.",
