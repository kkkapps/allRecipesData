    "des": "\"I got the original recipe from my father-in-law and made a few changes. It has been one of my family's favorites for over 20 years. Serve over white rice, or complete with a side of French fries.  It may not sound fancy but it is definitely delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large pot over medium-high heat until hot. Add beef and garlic; cook and stir until the beef is crumbly and no longer pink. Place cooked beef in a mesh strainer to drain off the grease.\nReturn beef to the pan and add the tomato sauce, green olives, and olive brine. Season with garlic salt, garlic powder, adobo seasoning, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
