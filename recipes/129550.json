    "des": "\"This is a terrific family dinner. Tender pieces of steak are sauteed with juicy peppers in a great sauce. Serve with white rice or buttered mashed potatoes, and Italian bread for dipping. This is a really easy dinner. I hope your family will enjoy this as much as mine does.\n\"",
    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the green and red peppers until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the peppers from the pan and set aside.\nPlace the steak strips into the skillet with the grated onion, and cook and stir for about 10 minutes, until the steak is evenly browned and no longer pink inside. Return the cooked peppers to the skillet, and stir in tomatoes, water, and sugar. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.\nSimmer over low heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until the steak is tender and the sauce has thickened.",
