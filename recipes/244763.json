    "ins": "Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Cut an \"X\" into the bottom of each chestnut using a sharp knife, trying not to pierce through the skin. Arrange chestnuts on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until toasted, about 15 minutes. Cool chestnuts until easily handled. Shell and peel chestnuts and break into small pieces. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir celery and onion until onion is soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add chestnuts, salt, poultry seasoning, and black pepper; stir until evenly mixed.\nPut bread cubes in a large bowl. Mix chestnut mixture into bread cubes. Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; drizzle over bread cube mixture and toss to coat. Transfer mixture to a baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 30 to 45 minutes.",
