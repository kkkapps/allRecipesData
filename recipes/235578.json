    "des": "\"The fresh ginger and Thai chile give this sweet-and-sour cranberry chutney some pleasant heat, and it's the perfect complement to roasted poultry or game. Garnish with a couple of fresh chiles for a pretty effect.\"",
    "ins": "Slowly heat shallot and garlic in a heavy pot with a lid over very low heat until they release some moisture but not yet browned, about 3 minutes.\nStir cider vinegar, brown sugar, apple juice, and orange juice together in the pot with the shallot and garlic; bring to a simmer while stirring to dissolve sugar. Add cranberries, apple, raisins, chile pepper, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, and salt to the simmering liquid; stir.\nBring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the mixture thickens and the cranberries are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and discard the chile pepper. Add salt to preference.",
