    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.\nBeat the oil and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the oil mixture before adding the next.\nStir flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; beat into the wet mixture. Fold grated carrots through the batter, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
