    "des": "\"This is a yummy chocolate cookie that's crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside! I bake it for my campers every year and they love it! The amount of sugar may be reduced so it's not too sweet.\"",
    "ins": "Sift together the flour and baking powder; set aside. In a medium bowl, stir chocolate into melted butter until melted and smooth. Mix in the sugar, eggs and vanilla. Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients. Stir in the chocolate chips. Cover dough and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper. Roll the chilled dough into 1 inch balls and roll each ball in confectioners' sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 9 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops are cracked. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.",
