Add remaining broth and set aside.\nMelt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the salt, ground black pepper, onion and dill weed to the butter, stir and saute for 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the flour and stir well.\nPour in the milk and heat until the mixture starts to thicken, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the pureed potato mixture. Allow to heat through and serve.",
