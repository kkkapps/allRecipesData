Gradually add small amounts of beaten egg, beating continuously.  In a small bowl, combine cocoa powder and hot water. Stir cocoa mixture into batter. Fold in flour using figure eight movement.  If the mixture is too stiff, batter should slowly drop off spoon when lifted from bowl, add a small amount of water.  Divide mixture into 12 muffin cups.\nBake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until well risen and firm to touch.   Allow to cool.\nCream 1/4 cup butter or margarine until soft.  Gradually add sifted confectioners sugar and vanilla extract.  Mix cream filling until smooth.\nCut circles from tops of muffins, and halve these to resemble butterfly wings.  Put a small amount of cherry jam in the cut out hole, and cover with a teaspoon of cream filling.  Place the wing shapes into the cream filling curved side down.",
