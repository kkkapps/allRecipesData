Remove from oven and set aside to cool.\nWhisk together the apple cider, vinegar, oil, salt, pepper, mustard and celery seed.\nPeel and slice the beets, combine with the vinaigrette and refrigerate at least half an hour.\nDivide the greens among four salad plates. Drain beets, and reserve dressing. Decoratively arrange overlapping layers of beet, onion, apple, and avocado on the greens. Drizzle with reserved dressing. Sprinkle on the nuts, and serve at once.",
