    "des": "\"This is the classic sweet and sour summer beet soup served as a shooter any time of the year. You can add a little vodka to it if you like, but I usually leave it out. The piquant taste is enough for us. Fix a tray of shooters at once so people can just help themselves.\"",
    "ins": "Place beets and their juices, 3/4 cup vegetable broth, 1/2 cup sour cream, lemon juice, and sugar into a blender. Blend until smooth; thin with more vegetable broth, if desired. Taste and season with salt as needed.\nTransfer borscht to a bowl. Cover and chill at least 3 hours or overnight.\nWhisk borscht; spoon 3 to 4 teaspoons into each shooter. Top each shooter with about 1/2 teaspoon of sour cream.",
