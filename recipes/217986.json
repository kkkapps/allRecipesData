Remember to season them as soon as they come out of the oil. Traditionally served with mayo-ketchup (1:1 ratio blend of mayonnaise and ketchup with fresh pressed garlic or garlic powder to taste).\"",

Gather about 2 tablespoons of shredded plantains and shape into patties.\nFry the patties in the preheated oil until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes.
