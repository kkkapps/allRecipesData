    "des": "\"Tender salmon fillets are braised to perfection in a mouthwatering sauce of fresh orange juice, chili-infused olive oil, and seasonings, making this a favorite dish with a 'kick.' Serve over a bed of rice and a side of steamed spinach for a super healthy and easy meal. The sauce is perfect to drizzle over the top.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nDrizzle olive oil into the bottom of a casserole dish. Lay salmon fillet atop the oil layer. Pour enough orange juice into the dish so the bottom third of the salmon is immersed in juice.\nSprinkle Montreal steak seasoning and togarashi over the top of the fillet. Arrange orange slices and habanero pepper slices atop the fish.\nBake in preheated oven until the flesh is light pink and flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes.  Transfer fish to a serving platter and serve with the sauce from the dish on the side.",
