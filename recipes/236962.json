    "des": "\"This simple yet yummy bread was traditionally made during the week after Passover. My family has been making this recipe from my grandma for years. My kids love it! This bread is only tasty the day you bake it. We love it just slathered with butter, but it also makes good sandwiches and crusts.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture with a fork or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into mixture and knead with hands to form dough.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly-floured work surface and roll to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut dough into sandwich-size pieces and poke each piece several times with a fork. Transfer slices to a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until just golden brown, about 30 minutes.",
