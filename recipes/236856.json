Beat eggs into butter mixture until well incorporated.\nWhisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a bowl; gradually add to creamed butter mixture, beating until dough is well blended. Fold chocolate chips into dough. Drop dough by rounded teaspoons onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cookies are set in the middle, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
