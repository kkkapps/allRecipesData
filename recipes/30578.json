Place steaks in hot pan, and cook for 1 minute on each side, or until browned. Reduce heat to medium-low, and add balsamic vinegar and red wine. Cover, and cook for 4 minutes on each side, basting with sauce when you turn the meat over.\nRemove steaks to two warmed plates, spoon one tablespoon of glaze over each, and serve immediately.",
