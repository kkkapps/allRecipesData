    "des": "\"Here is one of my favorite ways to prepare watercress. This salad is definitely different but delicious. I highly recommend using cherry or grape tomatoes since they have a firm texture. The peanuts should be crushed and not left whole and don't leave out or substitute the ingredients if possible. The flavors are very strong due to the lime and fish sauce, so be prepared. The watercress does not have to be chopped up.\"",
    "ins": "Place watercress in a large bowl; top with tomatoes, onion, peanuts, lime juice, sesame seeds, garlic oil, fish sauce, and salt. Toss mixture well; let sit for flavors to blend, about 10 minutes.",
