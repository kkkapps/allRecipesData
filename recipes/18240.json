    "des": "\"Light and dark chip cookies with walnuts. The chips are the freckles and the nuts are the warts. Four cups of nuts seems like an awful lot but that's right.  Also, if you chop the nuts, you might as well buy your cookies from a vending machine.\"",

Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, gradually stir into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips, white chocolate chips and walnuts until evenly distributed. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
