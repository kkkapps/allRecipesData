    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nRub tomato halves, bell pepper halves, onion halves, and garlic halves with olive oil; season with garlic powder, sea salt, and black pepper.\nCook vegetables on preheated grill, turning regularly, until wrinkled and slightly charred, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPut grilled vegetables into a blender bowl with mayonnaise and dried chipotle pepper; blend until smooth.",
