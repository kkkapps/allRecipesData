    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain the cooked bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Set the pan aside, reserving the bacon drippings.\nIn a saucepan, bring the corn and buttermilk to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat, and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes until all the liquid is gone.\nHeat the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet over medium heat. Slowly mix in the flour. When this begins to gently bubble, stir in the corn. Crumble the cooked bacon strips, and stir into the corn. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until the mixture is thick and well blended.  Serve immediately.",
