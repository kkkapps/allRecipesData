    "des": "\"These maple-glazed beauties took first place in the Allrecipes 'Holy Doughnuts!' contest at the 2015 Iowa State Fair. They're baked, not fried, and totally delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2 standard-size, 6-well (3 1/2-inch) doughnut pans with cooking spray.\nStir together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk together brown sugar, butter, oil, buttermilk, whole egg, egg yolk, pumpkin puree, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture, stirring just until no streaks of flour remain.\nSpoon mixture into prepared doughnut pans (they'll be quite full), and bake until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove doughnuts from pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool while you prepare glaze.\nMelt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat just until it begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in brown sugar, cream, and maple syrup. Return pan to low heat and cook until bubbly, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and whisk in powdered sugar and vanilla until smooth.\nSpread about 4 teaspoons of glaze over top of each doughnut, then immediately sprinkle with pecans (if using). Let stand until glaze is set, about 15 minutes.",
