    "des": "\"This is a vegan spin on a Bavarian carrot soup. It is very delicious and I have even seen it made with other vegetables, like beets, as the star of the dish. Try it out and experiment with other vegetables. I have even substituted the celery with an extra carrot and a teaspoon of celery seed and it worked out great. The recipe listed is my favorite and it is a great go-to for vegans. Enjoy!\"",
