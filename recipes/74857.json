    "des": "\"These are delicious meat turnovers made with delicately seasoned ground beef. You can use a pie crust from a mix, or make your own. These are great to freeze, and bake when you want a quick snack.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, bread crumbs, tomato sauce, green onions, soy sauce, Maggi seasoning, salt, pepper, and hot sauce. You may need to use your hands. Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nRoll out the pie crust dough to 1/8 inch thickness, and cut into 6 inch circles using a large coffee can.  Place a heaping tablespoon or slightly more of the meat mixture into the center of the circle, and fold over to make a half circle shape. Crimp the edges together using the tines of a fork, and place the pies on baking sheets.  The pies may also be frozen at this point. Whisk together the egg and water in a small bowl using a fork. Brush the egg wash over the tops of the pies.\nBake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. If you are baking frozen pies, add an additional 10 minutes.",
