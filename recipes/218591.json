    "des": "\"Absolutely delicious way to make Swiss chard. It has a comforting flavor and beautiful presentation. The colors are amazing and I often prepare this for family for Christmas dinner paired with standing rib roast and mashed potatoes and gravy. A huge hit in my family!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the red pepper, garlic, and portobello mushrooms. Cook and stir until the mushroom has softened and begun to release its liquid, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the leek, and continue cooking until the leek has softened, about 5 minutes.\nStir in the chicken broth and Swiss chard. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover, and simmer until the chard leaves have wilted, about 10 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue cooking until the chard is tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese; let stand until melted.",
