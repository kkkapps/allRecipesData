    "des": "\"These pancakes are a healthy alternative to traditional recipes. Serve them warm with a homemade brown sugar syrup. For the apples, be sure to use a firm baking variety such as Cortland or Granny Smith.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Pour in the milk, eggs and oil; stir just until smooth. Mix in the apple.\nHeat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip and cook until browned on the other side.\nTo make the glaze, heat the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the molasses, brown sugar and vanilla. Serve warm spooned over pancakes.",
