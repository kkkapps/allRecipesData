    "des": "\"This is a great stuffing recipe that is very easy and fun for the whole family. My mom used to include my sisters and I in the breaking of the bread. It has become a great family tradition. Stuffing not used in the bird may be cooked with the gizzards. For variety, mix in a pound of sausage or raisins when cooking the onions and celery.\"",
    "ins": "Allow the bread to become stale overnight. Break stale bread into pieces and place in a large bowl.\nMelt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Slowly cook and stir the celery and onions until the onions are soft. Transfer to the bowl with bread and mix by hand until well blended.\nSprinkle the mixture with sage seasoning and use to stuff the bird.",
