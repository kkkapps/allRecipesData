    "des": "\"First and foremost, I love 'overnight oatmeal.' I make a few over the weekend, so I have them ready to go for instant and hearty breakfasts throughout the week. I created this recipe on a whim when I had leftover roasted sweet potatoes. It tastes like a pumpkin pie, but, with its natural sweetness, you don't need any sweetener, which is what I love! It's hearty and healthy to boot. I served mine this morning with a sprinkle of toasted pecans and cinnamon.\"",
