    "des": "\"This sweet and crunchy salad is very kid friendly! I first tried this when I visited my family in Newfoundland, and managed to get a copy of the recipe.  Make lots, there won't be any left over. Any kind of lettuce can be used as well as spinach.  Raisins can also be added.\"",
    "ins": "Place the onion, sugar, mustard, celery seed, and black pepper into a small bowl. Pour in the vinegar, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Whisk in the olive oil until the dressing is thick. Cover, and refrigerate at least 3 hours.\nTo make the salad, toss the lettuce, oranges, mushrooms, almonds, and bacon together in a large bowl. Drizzle with the dressing, and toss again to coat.",
