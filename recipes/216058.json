    "des": "\"I wanted to create a meat loaf using ground turkey.  I decided to try a boxed stuffing mix to bind the ingredients, and it worked!  The kitchen will smell like Thanksgiving morning when you make this.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 5 3/4x11-inch loaf pan.\nIn a bowl, mix the stuffing mix with hot water, and let the mixture stand for 2 minutes to plump up the bread crumbs. In another bowl, mix the ground turkey with beaten eggs, salt, and black pepper. Mix into the stuffing until thoroughly combined. Spoon the loaf mixture into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let stand 10 minutes before serving.",
