Rose water can be substituted for the almond extract, and can be purchased in Middle Eastern stores, or maybe even health food stores.\"",

Add almond extract or rosewater (see Cook's Note), using your hands to blend the heavy mixture.\nStore in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 3 months.",
