    "des": "\"Named after the friend that first introduced this dish to me one homesick day. It is a simple pasta that lends itself to endless variety.  Try adding mushrooms or zucchini.  I find that angel hair pasta is best, but thicker pasta will certainly work as well.  Drizzle with extra olive oil before serving.\"",
