    "des": "\"Chicken breasts browned and simmered in a very berry sauce. Here is a great substitute for a full course holiday dinner. It can also be a comforting dish to serve on a cold winter night. Easy to make, low in fat and just plain scrumptious!! Serve with wild and basmati rice and seasonal steamed vegetables.\"",
