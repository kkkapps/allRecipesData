Once cooled, crumbs may be stored in the freezer, in a resealable plastic bag for as long as several months.\n\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nPush torn pieces of bread through the shredding disk of a food processor to make coarse crumbs. Spread the crumbs on a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until crumbs are dry but not toasted, 6 to 8 minutes. Shake the sheet twice during baking in order to evenly dry crumbs. Remove from the oven and cool completely.",
