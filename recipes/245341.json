    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCombine 3/4 cup Romano cheese, bread crumbs, granulated garlic, cayenne pepper, and thyme in a shallow bowl. Press each chicken cutlet into the cheese mixture, turning to coat. Arrange chicken in a baking dish.\nBake chicken in the preheated oven until slightly golden, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, and minced garlic to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until bell pepper and tomatoes soften, about 10 minutes.\nTransfer baked chicken to a plate; top with bell pepper and tomato mixture. Garnish with shaved Romano cheese.",
