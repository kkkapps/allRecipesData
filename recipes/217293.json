    "des": "\"Came up with this by accident. Has become a family favorite. Cheap, easy, and everyone loves it. If desired (try it without first) top individual servings with favorite cheese. I have never used cheese in it and no one notices. Goes great with garlic bread.\"",
    "ins": "Cook and stir the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until the meat is browned, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease. Pour in the water, bring to a boil, and stir in the bouillon cubes until the cubes are dissolved. Mix in broken lasagna noodles, tomato soup, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, and black pepper. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the lasagna noodle pieces are tender, about 10 minutes.\nRemove about 1 cup of sauce from the skillet, and mix with the cornstarch; return mixture to skillet, and simmer to thicken, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt.",
