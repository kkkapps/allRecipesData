    "des": "\"Sheildzini is a Japanese cucumber salad.  It is very simple to put together, and very delicious.   Do not prepare too far in advance as cucumbers become soggy.  If the skins are tough or bitter, peel the cucumbers before preparing salad.\"",
    "ins": "Cut cucumbers lengthwise, scoop out seeds with a spoon, and slice cucumbers into bite-sized pieces.  Transfer to a salad bowl.\nIn a small bowl, mix together salt, oil, sugar, rice wine vinegar, and soy sauce.  Pour over cucumbers, and gently toss.  Refrigerate several hours before serving, tossing every now and then.",
