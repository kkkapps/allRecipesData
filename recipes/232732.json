    "des": "\"This jam recipe has been tossed around my family for three generations and has never failed to work/turn out and is yummy no matter what we add to it! There are so many ways to change and add to it that any person in your family will love it. It also works well using strawberries and rhubarb together or any other berry you can think of instead of mulberries. The preserves may look runny or thin on the cupboard shelf, but once in the fridge they thicken up nicely.  Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Mix mulberries and 1 tablespoon water in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer, stirring frequently, until berries are softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Mash berries using a potato masher.\nCombine 2 cups water, sugar, strawberry-flavored gelatin, and pectin in a bowl; stir until gelatin is dissolved. Stir gelatin mixture into mashed mulberries; bring mixture to a boil.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the boiling mulberry mixture into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for about 15 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.",
