Add in the whipped butter.  The frosting may clump at this point if the butter is at all chilled.  Don't worry, it just means that the frosting will require more beating.  Beat until smooth.\nMelt the chocolate in a double boiler or the microwave.  Cool slightly; the chocolate should still be fairly warm.  Beat into the butter frosting.",
