    "des": "\"German Christmas cookie (orange-flavored wreaths).\"",
    "ins": "Cream together 1 cup sugar with  butter or margarine, and shortening.  Beat in 2 eggs and add orange peel.\nSift flour and gradually blend into sugar mixture.  Dough should hold together and not be crumbly.\nTake a walnut sized piece of dough, and roll in palms of hand to create a 4 to 6 inch rope.  Bring ends together to form a circle, and fold ends over each other.  Brush with a mixture made from beaten egg white and 2 teaspoons sugar; this makes a glossy finish.  Add green citron slices for  \"leaves\" and 1/2 red citron cherry for\" berry\" - use to decorate at the knot.\nBake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) on ungreased cookie sheets for 10 to 12 minutes.  Bake only until cookies are light brown on bottom - just barely baked.",
