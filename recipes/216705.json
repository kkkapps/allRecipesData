    "des": "\"This recipe was given to me in the late 1980s by Diane Thornton in Jackson Mississippi.  I have made it each year since, and when I bring it to gatherings people rave about it, so I bring it year after year.  Some people say it's more like a desert than a side dish. All I know is that it's a standby for me and always gets a nod.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBeat the pineapple, coconut, sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, milk, and 1/2 cup melted butter together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared pan; set aside. Mix the flour, brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and pecans in a bowl. Sprinkle pecan mixture over the batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbly and the topping is browned, about 30 minutes.",
