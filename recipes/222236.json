    "des": "\"I was craving corned beef and cabbage recently, but the thought of doing the same old New England boiled dinner had me yawning. I tried to think of some new, interesting braising liquid, and that's when I remembered I've never had something stewed in coconut milk that I didn't like. The coconut milk gave the broth a subtle sweetness and richness that I was really happy with.\"",
    "ins": "Place brisket, fat-side up, in the bottom of a Dutch oven. Stir in water, coconut milk, tomato paste, fish sauce, red curry paste, coriander, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that accumulates.\nStir in onion, celery, and carrots. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 3 hours, turning once.\nStir in potatoes and cabbage; cook until potatoes are tender and cabbage is soft and sweet, about 35 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate; thinly slice across the grain. Ladle potato cabbage mixture into bowls and top with sliced beef.",
