    "des": "\"Got the recipe from my retired neighbor, and the taste is wonderful  The second-day leftovers can be layered with mashed potatoes/whatever, turkey slices, any cooked veggie with some of the remaining sauce on top and re-heated. You could use a larger slow cooker and double the recipe easily for company. Great with a boneless breast or rolled white and dark meat turkey.\"",
    "ins": "Place the cranberry sauce in a bowl, and mash. Mix in the onion soup mix and orange juice together until the mixture is well combined.\nSpray the inside of a slow cooker with cooking spray, and place the turkey breast into the cooker. Pour the sauce ingredients over the turkey breast. Set the cooker on Low, and cook until the turkey breast is very tender, about 7 hours.",
