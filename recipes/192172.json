    "des": "\"I recently took a weekend trip, and I experienced one of the best meals of my life at a fine little establishment that specializes in Southern cuisine. One of the things that made this meal so memorable was the praline bacon that I had, so I took it upon myself to recreate it.  The only difference is that I like mine better.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPlace the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.\nSpread the pecans onto an unlined baking sheet, and toast 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown and aromatic. Watch the nuts carefully as they bake, because they burn quickly. Set aside to cool.\nStir the maple syrup, butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the hot candy resembles foamy caramel and a candy thermometer reads 270 degrees F (130 degrees C) (soft crack stage). Quickly stir in the pecans.\nToss the bacon in the candy mixture to coat each strip, and remove with tongs to cool and harden on the prepared baking sheet.
