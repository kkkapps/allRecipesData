Occasionally skim off scum as it forms.\nHeat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir carrots and onions until they begin to soften, 3 or 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and salt; cook for 1 minute.\nTransfer chicken and cooking water to  large pot. Add chicken broth. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low. Cover, leaving lid slightly ajar, and simmer at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Remove from heat.\nTransfer chicken to a work surface. Remove skin, bones, and cartilage. Shred chicken meat using 2 forks. Return chicken to pot. Add broccoli, cauliflower, and zucchini. Bring back to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat so soup gently simmers.
