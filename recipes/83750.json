Bake until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Cool. (Be sure the cake is completely cool before removing it from the pan, because it is very soft.)\nCombine cream cheese and powdered sugar. Spread over top and sides of cake. Decorate with mandarin oranges and walnuts.",
