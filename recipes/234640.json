    "des": "\"This is a recipe I created using wheat berries which is a healthy alternative to rice. It's also easy to substitute different nuts or fruit depending on what you have on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and wheat berries to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the wheat berries are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Drain any excess water and cool.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread walnuts onto a baking sheet.\nBake walnuts in the preheated oven until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven and cool.\nWhisk canola oil, raspberry wine vinegar, raspberry preserves, mustard, oregano, and black pepper together in a bowl until vinaigrette is smooth. Measure 1/2 cup vinaigrette and store remaining vinaigrette in an airtight container in the refrigerator for another use.\nCombine wheat berries, walnuts, pear, Gorgonzola cheese, cranberries, and green onions in a large bowl. Drizzle 1/2 cup vinaigrette over wheat berries mixture; toss to coat. Refrigerate for flavors to blend, about 30 minutes.",
