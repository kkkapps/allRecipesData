Cool.\nPlace the squash, 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, eggs, milk, vanilla, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is smooth. Pour into a large mixing bowl. Stir in the apples, carrots, and raisins until evenly blended. Spread the mixture over the bottom of the prepared baking dish.\nMix together the rolled oats, wheat bran, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1 tablespoon cinnamon with the melted butter in a bowl until crumbly. Spoon the topping over the apple-squash mixture.\nBake in preheated oven until top is golden brown and the apples are tender, 30 to 45 minutes.",
