    "des": "\"I was given a recipe as an alternative to the traditional 'sweet' sweet potato dishes. I was very dubious at first, but I went ahead, made it with fresh sweet potatoes (not canned, as they are not available in Canada), made my own adjustments and gave it a go. The finished product looked, smelled and tasted FANTASTIC! Not mushy, and the flavors mingle beautifully! People are pleasantly surprised when they taste it. Enjoy!\"",
