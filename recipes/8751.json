Put aside until serving time.\nLightly pound the chicken breasts with a mallet to flatten. Beat the egg and milk together. Then coat them in the egg/milk mixture then the breadcrumbs. Chill for 1/2 hour.\nSaute the chicken in olive oil until cooked through and juices run clear. Drain and serve with the mango salsa. Garnish with cilantro leaves.",
