    "des": "\"A light pasta salad both adults and kids will love. This is my own creation I am sure many have already tried. You can add or take away from this recipe. I usually serve crowds of 10 to 20 people, but I love to entertain so I also always serve this, spinach dip, potato and green salad, chip with dip and wings... This dish is always a hit!\"",

Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and cool.\nMix tuna and cucumber together in a salad bowl; stir in cooked bow-tie pasta and ranch dressing. Chill at least 1 hour.",
