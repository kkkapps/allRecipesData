    "ins": "Cream together butter or margarine, shortening, sugars, eggs and vanilla.  Add dry ingredients (except candy) and mix well.  Dough will be greasy.\nUsing a floured surface and rolling pin, roll out dough.  Cut out 2 inch heart shaped cookies.  Using a 1 inch heart shaped cookie cutter, cut out a smaller heart in the middle of the larger one.  Put cookies on a foil lined cookie sheet.\nInside of cut-out heart, sprinkle crushed candy crumbs (such as red life savers or candy canes).  Spread the crumbs to the inside edges of the cookie.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degees C) for 10-12 minutes.  When cookes have cooled, remove from sheets.  The cookie can be frosted if you desire.",
