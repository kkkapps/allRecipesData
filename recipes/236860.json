    "des": "\"I'm all about simply prepared vegetables, but every once in a while I need to cover them in caramelized pork and cheese, and this stunningly delicious pancetta-wrapped leek gratin was one of those times. I love those times.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nWrap each leek half in pancetta.\nDrizzle olive into a baking dish and use a pastry brush to spread oil over the bottom of the dish and partway up the sides. Season dish with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Place leeks close together cut-side down into the prepared baking dish. Pour chicken broth and wine over leeks. Cover baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and set it on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until just tender, about 45 minutes. Uncover the baking dish, pour cream over the top, and spread Parmigiano-Reggiano over the top. Return to oven and bake until cheese is golden and sauce is bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes more. Cool for 10 minutes before transferring leeks to a deep plate; ladle wine-cream sauce over the top and garnish with chives.",
