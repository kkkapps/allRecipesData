    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch bundt pan.\nUse an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar together. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Mix in whiskey, lemon zest, lemon juice, yogurt, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Stir the flour into the batter a little bit at a time. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.\nStir the baking powder into the batter. Remove 3/4 cup batter from bowl. Pour remaining batter into prepared bundt pan. Stir the cocoa powder into the reserved batter. Pour chocolate batter evenly into the center of the batter in the pan.\nBake cake in preheated oven until the top is golden, and the cake springs back when pressed lightly, about 40 minutes. Allow cake to cool before removing from bundt pan.",
