    "des": "\"This delicious chicken casserole is a favorite of my family and friends. I think it's the combination of flavors in this dish that make it so spectacular. Great served over rice with a nice salad and some good bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish.\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in skillet, and cook 10 minutes, or until juices run clear. Drain, and transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Mix with mayonnaise, water chestnuts, pimentos, almonds, celery seed, and lemon juice. Season with garlic salt to taste. Layer with cheese, and top with French-fried onion rings.\nBake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and onion rings are lightly browned. If rings start to get too brown, put foil on casserole or lower oven rack. Watch carefully, or onion rings will burn.",
