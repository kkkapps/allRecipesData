    "des": "\"I am calling these Russian because of my use of beets in the recipe. One day when I decided to make deviled eggs for the first time, I had made a beet salad that my mom taught me. This was just grated boiled beets mixed with mayonnaise and fresh garlic. I decided to use this instead of just plain mayo. And from here, my recipe was born! Hope you like it.\"",
    "ins": "Place beet in a small saucepan with water to cover; bring to a simmer and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool. Grate beet on medium holes of a grater. Place grated beet in a bowl; stir in mayonnaise, mustard, and relish.\nPlace eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.\nCut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir beet mixture into egg yolks. Season with paprika, salt, and pepper.\nPlace egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into egg white halves; top with cilantro.",
