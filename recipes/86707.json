    "ins": "Place the ribs in a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until the meat is no longer pink, about 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the soy sauce, red wine, olive oil, flour, brown sugar, garlic and curry powder.\nDrain the ribs, and coat generously with the sauce. Arrange them on a baking sheet.\nRoast for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fork tender. Pour the remainder of the sauce over the ribs about halfway through.",
