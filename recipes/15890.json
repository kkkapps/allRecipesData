    "ins": "In a heavy skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in onions and mushrooms. Cook and stir until mushrooms release liquid and onions soften, about 5 minutes.\nCrumble cornbread and place in large bowl. Tear toast into bite-sized pieces; add to cornbread.\nAdd mushrooms and onions, granulated garlic, pepper, egg and white wine. Mix thoroughly; add enough broth to moisten.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nThis recipe makes enough to stuff a 12- to 14-pound turkey, with 4 to 5 cups left over. Place excess stuffing in a baking dish and bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes.",
