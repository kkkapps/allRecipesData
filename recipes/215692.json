    "des": "\"This hot cereal is a delicious twist on oatmeal with some added protein and fiber to help satisfy you and keep you full.  It's a great start for a good morning!  Sometimes I heat up the water and milk real quick and let the quinoa soak while I'm in the shower, that way it can cook while I get ready and only needs a couple more minutes once everything else is added. Top with granola, if desired. Apple slices and/or sauce can be substituted for banana.\"",
    "ins": "Stir the water, milk, and quinoa together in a saucepan; bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes, or until the quinoa begins to soften. Stir in the banana, rolled oats, oat bran, salt, and cinnamon. Cook, stirring frequently over low heat for 2 to 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and stir in the walnuts, brown sugar, and vanilla.",
