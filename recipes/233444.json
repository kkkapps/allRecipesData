    "des": "\"This is a recipe that I have put together over some various websites, verbal consultations and just experimenting on my own and with my family. Rich and hearty with a great flavor when you can't get the real thing in the islands. Try a variety of hot peppers to change the flavor - even sweet bell peppers give a different taste. Use fresh thyme to really bring out the fresh taste.\"",
    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, tomato, garlic, curry powder, habanero pepper, and thyme until onion is golden, about 7 minutes. Stir in chicken and cook until chicken is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\nPour water into the skillet, reduce heat to low; cover and simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 30 minutes. Season with salt.",
