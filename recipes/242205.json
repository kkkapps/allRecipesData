    "des": "\"The 'ancient grain' spelt is related to modern wheat, but it's actually an entirely different species. From what I hear, it's easier to digest, higher in protein and fiber, and to me at least, has a much better flavor and texture than other whole-wheat flours. Top with favorite pizza toppings!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk 1 cup flour, water, honey, and yeast together in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and mixture is bubbly, about 20 minutes.\nStir remaining flour, olive oil, and salt into yeast mixture. Beat mixture in a bowl with an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, adding more flour as necessary, until a soft and tacky dough forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Place dough in mixing bowl with a little olive oil, cover bowl with a plate, and let rise until doubled in size, 90 minutes.\nPunch dough down and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 4 balls; cover each and let rest until dough rises slightly, 30 to 45 minutes. Roll into desired shapes and thickness.",
