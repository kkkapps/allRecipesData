    "ins": "On a large dinner plate, spread cream cheese to edge of plate.  The cheese should be spread to about a 1/4 inch to 1/3 inch thickness.  Pour cocktail sauce in center of plate, leaving  a 1-inch ring around the edge of cream cheese.  Make a pile of the shrimp by covering the cocktail sauce.\nArrange crackers by sticking them standing up into the cream cheese ring around the edge. Place them tight like dominos around the entire plate.",
