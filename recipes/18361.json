    "des": "\"This pie tastes like the traditional grasshopper pie only it does not contain alcohol.  It's great in the summer because of its light texture. If desired, top with dark chocolate shavings before serving.\"",
    "ins": "In large saucepan combine marshmallows and milk. Stir over medium heat until the marshmallows are completely melted. Chill until mixture holds its shape when dropped from a spoon.\nSlowly mix in the mint extract and chocolate extract and stir until all the ingredients are combined completely.\nBeat the whipping cream in a chilled bowl until it forms stiff peaks. Gently fold whipping cream into marshmallow mixture.  Add food coloring to desired color.\nSpread into pie crust. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Be sure to refrigerate any leftovers.",
