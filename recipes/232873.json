Comfort food shouldn't be fussy and with this slow cooker version of chicken and stuffing you can come home to a house filled with the aromas and memories of childhood. The whole family is sure to enjoy this healthy, well-balanced meal. Great on a cold night! Begs to be paired with warm rolls or french bread. When we have company and extra mouths, a side salad goes well or even green bean casserole if we feel like indulging big time. Can't beat a glass of cold milk with this dish! Recipe can easily be doubled if your slow cooker allows. Garnish with sage leaves if desired.\"",
