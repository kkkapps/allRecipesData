    "des": "\"I wanted a great trail mix without all the preservatives of the commercial products, at a lower cost, that was shelf-stable as I was going to have to live off of re-supply packages for about 6 months. I incorporated pumpkin seeds, coconut, and semisweet chocolate for extra boosts of energy!\"",

Divide oat mixture between 2 large baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Stir granola and switch position of the sheets. Continue baking until granola is lightly browned, 15 to 30 minutes more. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in a resealable container.",
