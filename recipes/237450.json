    "des": "\"I only eat paleo these days and sometimes it's hard to find recipes that are fast and easy to make. One beautiful Arizona day, I realized I was really hungry, but was also totally unwilling to head to the store. So I scraped together what ingredients I had and was pretty pleased with the end result. This is the first recipe I've ever shared here, so I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did! \n\nGarnish with some Thai basil and avocado pieces (maybe even a little bacon) and enjoy the heck out of this thing!\"",

Mash sweet potatoes into the broth using a potato masher.\nMix coconut milk, shallot, maple syrup, curry powder, sea salt, chili powder, and paprika into sweet potato mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and blend soup with a hand blender until smooth.",
