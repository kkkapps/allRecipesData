    "ins": "Beat cream cheese and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add 1/4 cup brown sugar, confectioners' sugar, apple pie spice, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Transfer cheese mixture to a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap plastic wrap around cheese, forming a ball; refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours.\nMix pecans, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together on a shallow plate. Unwrap cheese ball and roll in the pecan mixture until evenly coated, pressing to help topping stick to cheese ball.",
