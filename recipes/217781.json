    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until the oil shimmers with heat, and stir in the cardamom pods, bay leaves, cloves, and cinnamon stick until the spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds; mix in the onions and green chile peppers, and cook and stir until the onions are beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the potatoes, ginger garlic paste, and carrots; cook and stir for 5 more minutes. Mix in the coriander, black pepper, turmeric, and salt; cook for 2 more minutes, stirring frequently.\nStir in the coconut milk, water, chicken breast meat, yogurt, cream, and tomatoes; bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook partially covered, stirring every 5 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is no longer pink inside, 20 to 30 minutes. Discard cardamom pods, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick before serving.",
