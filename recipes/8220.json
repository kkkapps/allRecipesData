    "des": "\"Luscious, creamy frosting that doesn't taste too sweet. This frosting  is delicious on any cake, but I especially like it on coconut cake, sprinkled generously with coconut between layers and on top of cake.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium sized saucepan, stir the sugar, flour, cornstarch and gelatin together. Add the eggs and beat until smooth. Beat in the milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the butter and the vanilla. Let cool and chill until cold.\nOnce cold, beat until smooth and fluffy.\nWhip the cream into soft peaks and fold it into the frosting. Makes enough to frost one 8 or 9 inch layer cake.",
