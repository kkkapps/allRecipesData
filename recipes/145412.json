    "des": "\"This is one hundred percent Chilean. It is a sort of caramel that can be found everywhere in Chile. Actually, most pastrymaking in my country has manjar in it. The truth is that one can eat manjar anytime during the day and in many different ways: with bread, cheese, cookies and, my favorite, with meringue. Some of my foreign friends love it, some others hate it, so I guess you must give it a try and judge then.\"",
    "ins": "Bring milk, sugar, and vanilla extract to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking, and continuously stirring until the milk has thickened and turned a caramel color, about 1 hour or more.\nStir in baking soda. Continue cooking until the caramelized milk has reached a pudding consistency. Pour manjar into a bowl and cool completely in the refrigerator.",
