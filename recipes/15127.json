    "ins": "Place the bacon in a skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside. Melt the butter in a skillet, and saute the chicken breasts 10 to 12 minutes on each side, until the exterior is golden, the meat is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.\nPlace the green beans in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes, or until tender.\nPreheat the oven broiler. Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nArrange the beans in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with the chicken, and cover evenly with the soup. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and bacon, and top with Cheddar cheese.\nBroil 10 minutes, or until browned and bubbly.",
