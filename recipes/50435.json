    "des": "\"A yummy twist to an old favorite. The fry bread makes the difference. It's a popular request at my house. I do up everything but the fry bread in advance, and just heat up before serving. You can also top with other of your favorite taco toppings, such as onion, sour cream, or guacamole. Leftover fry bread can be used as dessert - coat it with cinnamon and sugar, and drizzle with honey.\"",
    "ins": "Combine beans and 2 tablespoons of picante sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.\nCombine ground beef and taco seasoning mix in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Cover, and keep warm while you prepare the fry bread.\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in milk and mix until the dough comes together. Add more flour if necessary to be able to handle the dough.\nOn a floured surface, knead the dough until smooth, at least 5 minutes. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Break off 3/4 cup sized pieces of dough, and shape into round discs 1/4 inch in thickness, making a thinner depressed area in the center.\nHeat 1 1/2 inches oil in a large, deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Fry dough in the hot oil until golden on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.\nTop fry bread with beans, ground beef, lettuce, and Cheddar cheese. Spoon picante sauce on top.",
