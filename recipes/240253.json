Saute onion and garlic in butter mixture until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes; add Brussels sprouts and saute until slightly browned on edges, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle bacon, chicken bouillon, red pepper flakes, and black pepper over the sprouts mixture; stir and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.\nPour wine over the sprouts mixture, reduce heat to low, place a lid on the pot, and simmer until the sprouts are desired tenderness, 10 to 15 minutes.",
