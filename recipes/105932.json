    "des": "\"This is one of the most popular chicken dishes.  An extremely easy and flavorful chicken dish with just a few simple ingredients. Traditionally for this dish the chicken is cut into 16 pieces (usually by the butcher) but you can make it with bigger pieces as well. The spiciness of the dish can be varied by increasing or decreasing the amount of black pepper and green chile in the recipe to suit your taste.\"",

Turn heat to low, then stir in the tomato, ginger paste, serrano peppers, crushed peppercorn, and salt.  Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.\nPour in the water and turn the pieces of chicken over.  Cover, and continue cooking until the chicken is done, about 15 minutes more, adding additional water as necessary.",
