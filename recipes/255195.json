    "des": "\"Fabulous and simplistic dish for those who don't like 'sweet' sweet potatoes. You can easily substitute butternut squash in this dish. Makes 3 large helpings or 4 medium-sized helpings.\"",
    "ins": "Cut sweet potato into spaghetti-like ribbons with a spiralizer.\nHeat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potato ribbons; cook, stirring often and adding more oil to prevent sticking, until starting to soften, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate.\nHeat butter in the same skillet until melted and foaming, about 1 minute. Add sage leaves; swirl until butter is a rich caramel color and leaves are crisp and dark green, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove sage leaves from the butter. Add sweet potato; stir to coat well.\nSeason sweet potato with salt and garnish with crisp sage leaves.",
