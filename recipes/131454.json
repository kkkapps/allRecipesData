    "des": "\"This salad has been a family favorite for over four generations, requested every Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is smooth and creamy with the crunch of pecans, and light green in color. It has a very unique flavor, and goes very quickly at our home. Any left over crushed pineapple and cottage cheese make a great snack for kids.\"",
    "ins": "In a large measuring pitcher, mix reserved pineapple juice and enough water to yield 2 cups. Pour into a pot and bring to a boil. Add the lime and lemon gelatin mixes and stir until completely dissolved.\nStir the mayonnaise and evaporated milk together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the gelatin mixture until completely blended. Mix in the crushed pineapple, cottage cheese, and pecans. Pour the gelatin mixture into a serving bowl. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.",
