Remove saucepan from heat and cover with a lid.\nPlace sugar in a blender and pour in enough water to fill halfway; add seeds. Blend sugar-seed mixture until smooth; pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a pitcher. Repeat blending and straining if a thinner drink is desired, adding more water as desired. Refrigerate juice until cooled, about 1 hour.",
