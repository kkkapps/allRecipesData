    "des": "\"I couldn't ever find the perfect Waldorf salad - one that wasn't too mayonaise-y tasting, yet one that still held enough of the original flavor to be called a Waldorf. So I mixed and matched and experimented, and finally came up with a perfect twist on the classic Waldorf Salad recipe. Now I get requests for it at every family get together!\"",

In a separate bowl, stir together the yogurt, white sugar, brown sugar, mayonnaise, lemon juice and cinnamon. Pour the dressing over the fruit mixture and stir gently until evenly coated.",
