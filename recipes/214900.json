    "des": "\"Here's a delightful dish I adapted from a non-vegetarian recipe. It's extremely easy to prepare in the crock pot. Deliciously creamy, it can be served by itself, with rice, or with steamed soft tortillas. Also makes a good samosa filling. It has a nice touch of hot pepper to it.\"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes into the bottom of a slow cooker.\nMix the curry powder, flour, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle over the potatoes. Stir the potatoes to coat evenly. Add the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, onion soup mix, and coconut cream; stir to combine.\nCover the slow cooker and cook on Low until the mixture is bubbling, adding water as needed to keep moist, 3 to 4 hours. Add the carrots to the mixture and cook another 30 minutes. Stir the peas into the mixture and cook until the vegetables are tender to your liking, about 30 minutes. Garnish individual portions with cilantro to serve.",
