    "ins": "In a small bowl, mix together the crushed cookies and butter. Press into the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.\nIn a medium bowl, beat the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy using an electric mixer. Stir in candied peel and 2 ounces of grated chocolate by hand. Spoon the filling over the chilled crust, and smooth out the top surface. Refrigerate for 6 hours, or overnight.\nJust before serving, whip cream with 1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar until stiff in a small bowl using an electric mixer. Run a knife around the outside edge of the cake, and remove the sides of the pan. Spread the whipped cream over the top of the cake, and sprinkle with remaining grated chocolate. Serve immediately.",
