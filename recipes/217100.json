    "des": "\"'The best chocolate cake I've ever had!' You'll hear comments like this and more when you serve this ultra dark, rich chocolate cake with its luscious chocolate icing. This recipe is adapted from one created by Diana, the talented editor of Allrecipes' UK site (allrecipes.co.uk). Use a chocolate bar with 74 percent cacao to intensify the chocolate flavor (not baking chocolate), and don't wait until St. Paddy's Day to make it!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 9-inch cake pans, and dust with 1 tablespoon cocoa.\nIn a heavy saucepan over low heat, heat 1 cup of stout beer, 1 1/4 cup of unsalted butter, 4 ounces of dark chocolate, and the superfine sugar just until the butter and chocolate have melted; stir to blend mixture, and cool slightly.\nBeat the eggs and creme fraiche together in a large mixing bowl; gradually stir in the flour and baking soda. Add the melted chocolate mixture in small additions, stirring to blend. Pour half the batter into each prepared cake pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top of the cake bounces back when touched lightly with a finger, about 40 minutes. Cool the cakes on racks.\nTo make the icing, place 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, 4 ounces of dark chocolate, and 5 tablespoons of stout beer in a heavy saucepan over low heat, and cook, stirring, just until the chocolate has melted; stir to blend mixture.  Remove from heat, and cool slightly.\nSift the confectioners' sugar. In a mixing bowl, blend the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, and vanilla extract until smooth; gradually beat in 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar. Pour in the cooled chocolate-stout mixture and mix well. Add confectioners' sugar until the icing is your desired consistency, adding more if you like a stiffer icing.\nPlace a cake on a serving plate, and smooth about one third of the frosting over the cake top. Place the second cake onto the frosted layer, and spread remaining two thirds of the frosting over the top and sides of the cake.",
