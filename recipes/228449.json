    "des": "\"This is a very unique sweet potato pie recipe, given to me by my mother. It's quite sweet, with a lighter texture than your typical sweet potato pie. If you like sweet potatoes and you have a sweet tooth, this one's for you!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sweet potatoes in an aluminum foil-lined baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork and skin loosens, 30 to 45 minutes. Allow potatoes to cool.\nPeel potatoes and mash with a potato masher in a large bowl. Beat sugar, evaporated milk, butter, corn syrup, eggs, flour, vanilla extract, apple pie spice, and salt into mashed sweet potatoes with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Pour sweet potato batter into pie crust. Excess batter can be reserved for another use.\nBake in preheated oven until pie is set and crust is browned, 45 to 50 minutes.",
