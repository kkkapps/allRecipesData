    "des": "\"Tired of fried eggplant?  Eggplant Parmesan too much of a hassle?  I came up with this recipe to deal with the plethora of tomatoes and eggplants the garden gives up every summer.  I've also added a slice of sweet onion to the packets at times and that's good too. Although I would suggest you try it this way first so you can see just how creamy and good an eggplant really tastes, feel free to add any other herbs you think might be good with this. Oh!  by the way, don't eat the skin - that's where the bitter taste is.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.\nPlace one eggplant half and one tomato half on each sheet of aluminum foil. Sprinkle with garlic salt and black pepper. Drizzle with the olive oil. Fold the foil up to form packets.\nGrill the packets until the eggplant and tomato are very tender, about 15 minutes.",
