Pour in 1/4 cup soy sauce and coat the chops with soy sauce. Pour in honey, remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce, and water; mix thoroughly. Reduce heat to medium.\nStir in zucchinis, carrots, onion, green bell pepper, and celery; cook and stir vegetables until cooked through but still slightly firm, about 10 more minutes.",
