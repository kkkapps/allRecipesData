    "des": "\"This very hot and flavorful pepper paste can be used to spice up any dish or used as a hot sauce.  Use gloves when cutting peppers or your hands will burn for days.  Also make sure to cook in a well ventilated kitchen. If your vent hood does not work well, open some windows and use a fan.\"",
    "ins": "Bring the habaneros and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in carrots, onion, cumin and garlic. Carefully puree the vegetables in a blender until smooth, then return to the saucepan, and continue simmering 45 minutes to 1 hour until thickened to the consistency of oatmeal. When ready, refrigerate overnight before using.",
