    "des": "\"My wife prefers my pan-fried steaks over grilled Filet Mignon, New York Strip or Sirloin any day. The key is not so much the cut of the meat, rather how it is prepared to give it its magic.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a skillet over medium heat. Season the steak with hot pepper sauce. Sprinkle or mist with a little lime juice and season lightly with just a portion of the garlic salt, salt, black pepper and blackened seasoning.\nPlace the steak in the pan and cover with a lid. Cook for about 20 minutes, or to your desired degree of doneness, turning and adding more seasoning every 5 minutes.\nRemove steaks to a serving platter and keep warm. Stir butter and water into the pan, removing any browned bits from the bottom to make a gravy. Season with additional garlic salt, salt and pepper to taste. Serve steaks with gravy drizzled over them.",
