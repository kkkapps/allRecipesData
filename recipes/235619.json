    "ins": "Stir cranberries, confectioners' sugar, tangerine juice, tangerine zest, and cinnamon together in a non-stick saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the cranberries pop and the mixture thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. Crush any remaining whole cranberries against the sides of the saucepan with a spatula to burst.",
