    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and let noodles cool.\nBeat eggs with cinnamon and vanilla extract in a large bowl; gently stir in noodles. Mix pineapple, raisins, and apple into noodle mixture. Transfer mixture into a large casserole dish and scatter pieces of margarine over the noodle mixture. Spread apricot preserves over the casserole.\nBake in the preheated oven until noodles on top are golden brown and preserves are bubbling, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.",
