Cover and allow to rest on the counter until the cucumbers and onion releases about 1 inch of liquid and are softened, 3 to 4 hours.\nDrain cucumbers and onion in a colander and thoroughly rinse to remove any remaining salt. Let the vegetables continue to drain in the colander for 30 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl, then stir in the sour cream. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.",
