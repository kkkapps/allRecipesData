    "des": "\"This recipe I revised from my grandma's Christmas angel roll-out cookies. They are sort of cakey, but this can be reduced by omitting half of the cream of tartar, though I prefer them thick and soft. Top with your favorite cream cheese or basic cookie frosting. I find it's best with almond extract and coconut on top. Enjoy!\"",

Add 1 egg, allowing it to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next with the vanilla extract.\nDissolve cream of tartar in milk; beat into the butter mixture. Add 4 cups flour and pinch of salt; beat until doughy.\nSpread 1 cup flour onto a flat work surface. Roll the dough out on the prepared surface; cut out in desired shapes until all dough is used.\nBake on non-stick baking sheets in preheated oven until cookies are set in the middle, about 12 minutes.",
