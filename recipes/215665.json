    "des": "\"My best friend is Syrian and taught me to make this. It is often eaten for breakfast, but I like to make it for dinner. It is vegan and great for fasting periods. If you cannot find fava beans, check a middle eastern market. Add more lemon juice if you like it bitter! Serve with pita bread. It's also great with Kalamata olives, feta cheese, and lemon wedges.\n\"",
    "ins": "Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the fava beans, garbanzo beans, and water to the onion; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Stir the tomato paste, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, the garlic, tahini, and cumin through the bean mixture; return the mixture to a boil and allow to cook at a boil for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nPour the mixture into a blender. Hold the lid of the blender in place with a towel and start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the mixture moving before leaving it on to puree to your desired consistency.",
