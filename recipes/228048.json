Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.\nPrepare a grill for high heat. Place bread slices on a foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.\nCombine strawberries and thyme in a small bowl and set aside.\nGrill bread on the preheated grill until browned, about 3 minutes per side.\nSpread goat cheese on toasted bread. Add black pepper, salt, and reduced vinegar to the strawberry mixture. Spoon over the goat cheese topped bruschetta. Garnish with additional thyme.",
