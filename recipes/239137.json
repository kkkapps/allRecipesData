    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking dish.\nStir 1/4 cup melted butter and salt together in a bowl.\nArrange chicken in the baking dish. Brush butter mixture onto the chicken until thoroughly coated, pouring any extra over the chicken.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
