    "des": "\"These make a special breakfast on cool fall mornings.  My boys loved to help me cook a batch up for a 'breakfast for supper' night around Halloween.  Use any and all decorations you like to make jack-o-lantern faces on the pancakes. Try broken candy bar pieces, banana slices, raisins, crasins, or chopped nuts.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate large bowl, lightly beat together the milk, egg, pumpkin, and oil. Stir flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture, blending just until moistened.\nHeat a lightly greased griddle over medium high heat.\nPour batter, 1/3 cup at a time, onto the prepared griddle. Make a jack-o-lantern face in each pancake with the chocolate chips. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 5 minutes per side.",
