    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin pan or line with paper baking cups.\nIn a medium bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in the honey, eggs, buttermilk and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the batter just until blended. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, dividing evenly.\nBake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. When cool, arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter.\nWhip the heavy cream in a chilled bowl using an electric mixer until stiff enough to hold a peak. Sweeten with confectioners' sugar if desired. Spoon on top of cupcakes and top each one with sliced strawberries right before serving.",
