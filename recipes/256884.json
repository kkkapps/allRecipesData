    "ins": "Combine water and red lentils in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Stir in bulgur and remove saucepan from heat. Cover and let stand until bulgur absorbs the residual moisture, about 5 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir spring onions until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste; cook for 2 to 3 minutes.\nCombine red lentil mixture and onion mixture in a large bowl. Add parsley, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, cumin, and salt; knead by hand until evenly distributed.\nShape mixture into small logs or round balls and arrange on a plate. Cover with plastic wrap to prevent the tops from drying out before serving.",
