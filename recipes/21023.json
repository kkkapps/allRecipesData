    "ins": "Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat.  Cook the shredded potatoes until golden brown on both sides.   In a small bowl combine the melted processed cheese with the diced tomatoes with chiles.\nStir in half of the peas and half of the corn, and mash them into the hash browns.  When well combined, add the remaining peas and corn; continue mashing to combine.  Stir in about 1 cup of the cheese and tomato mixture and mix well.  Cook for 10 minutes, or until heated through.\nSpoon the potato mixture into the tortillas and roll like a burrito.  Smother with cheese/tomato mixture.",
