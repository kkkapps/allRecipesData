Cook and stir until onion is tender and meat is no longer pink. Drain grease.\nTransfer the meat and onion to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and mix in the egg noodles, cheese, tomato sauce, corn, green pepper and mushrooms.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbling hot and lightly browned on the top.",
