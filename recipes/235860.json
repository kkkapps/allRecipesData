Layer in a wine glass, sweetened whipped cream, berries, sauce, then more whipped cream. Top with a berry and sprinkle with a little powdered sugar. So good! They also use this sauce on their Monte Cristo Sandwich.\"",
    "ins": "Combine wine, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a saucepan; simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces, about 30 minutes.",
