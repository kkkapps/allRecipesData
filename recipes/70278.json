    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until shrunken, but not crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain.\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nIn a shallow baking dish, whisk together the sugar, soy sauce and garlic with a fork. Wrap each oyster with a piece of bacon, and secure with toothpicks. Place wrapped oysters into the dish with the sauce.\nBake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the sauce has thickened and bacon is nicely crisped at the edges.",
