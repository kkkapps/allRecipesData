    "des": "\"These flavorful artichokes with their butter, garlic and shallot taste are sure to please any artichoke fan.  I especially like the smokey flavor the grill adds.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the artichokes into the boiling water, and season with salt and pepper. Throw in half of the garlic, and half of the shallot. Boil for about 30 minutes, or until a fork is easily inserted into the stem of the artichokes. Drain and set aside.\nMelt the butter in a small pan over medium heat, and stir in the remaining garlic and shallot. Cook just until fragrant, then remove from the heat.\nPlace the artichoke halves onto the preheated grill. Brush some of the melted butter onto them. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, brushing with butter occasionally, until lightly toasted. Serve with remaining butter as a dipping sauce.",
