    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix cream cheese, 8 tablespoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon cinnamon in a bowl until well blended. Spoon 1 teaspoonful of the filling into each wonton wrapper. Fold the wonton like a triangle and seal 2 edges together with water; squeeze the sides together to lock out the air. Wet the ends of the triangle; fold into the center 1 at a time.\nPlace the filled wontons carefully into the oil; cook until golden brown on 1 side, about 2 minutes. Turn wontons over and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 2 minutes.\nMix 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle on top of fried wontons.",
