    "des": "\"This recipe is truly a family favorite. I don't know any one else that makes this. I think my father-in-law invented it. When people had little money they used whatever was at hand. My father used to say 'one will never starve if they have potatoes, onions, and a loaf of bread.' This is a typical peasant recipe that was made when times were not as affluent as they are today. Really good on a cold snowy day.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.  Saute onions until translucent.  To the onions add water, potatoes, salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender but still firm.\nRemove from heat and gently crack eggs into soup; be careful not to break eggs.  Place on low heat until whites of eggs are cooked.  Cool slightly before serving.",
