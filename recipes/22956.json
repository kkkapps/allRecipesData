    "des": "\"This is my original recipe and can be either vegetarian or meat based.  It also freezes well - just thaw, heat and add cream or yoghurt before serving.  It's delicious and well worth the extra steps of roasting and pureeing.  Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.\nPlace squash halves and onion onto the prepared baking sheet. Wrap garlic in foil and set with other vegetables.\nRoast in the center of the oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until the squash is tender. Remove from oven and set aside until cool enough to handle.\nSqueeze garlic cloves out of their skin like paste into a food processor. Scrape the flesh from the squash and place into the food processor along with the roasted onion. Puree until smooth. Add vegetable broth if necessary. Transfer the pureed mixture to a stockpot and stir in  vegetable broth. Season with the bay leaf, brown sugar, curry powder, oregano, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in yogurt.\nRemove bay leaf and serve hot. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.",
