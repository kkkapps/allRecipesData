Furthermore, he can feed himself (with a sippy cup) while I make breakfast and lunch for the older kids. The texture is similar to pudding. If runnier texture is desired, add ice or milk.\"",
    "ins": "Blend the orange in a blender until mostly juice.\nAdd the water and kale; blend again on High speed until kale is liquefied.\nBreak the bananas into chunks and add to the blender. Start blending on a lower speed until the banana is incorporated. Increase speed to blend the mixture into a pudding-like texture.",
