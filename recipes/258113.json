    "ins": "Sprinkle salt over chicken breasts and spread evenly over chicken using your hands. Place chicken in a microwave-safe bowl; add sake and top with garlic.\nMix ground sesame seeds, soy sauce, and sugar together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.\nCover bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and heat in microwave until no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Let chicken cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.\nShred chicken into bite-size pieces and place in serving bowl; top with broccoli sprouts and sauce.",
