Form dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 3 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRoll dough out on a floured work surface to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Cut dough into shapes using cookie cutters and place cookies onto baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until firm, 9 to 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on sheets for 2 to 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to finish cooling.",
