    "des": "\"This recipe can be eaten as a main or side dish. The key to developing the flavor (and not missing the meat) is caramelizing and developing deep browning of the onions and carrots. In the Caribbean, cooks call this 'burning' the onions.\"",
    "ins": "Heat canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, carrots, salt, black pepper, and sugar until onion is a deep brown color, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; add garlic, chile pepper, ginger, and curry powder. Stir constantly to incorporate, about 5 minutes.\nIncrease heat to medium-heat and stir 1 can vegetable broth into the onion mixture. Scrape up any vegetables or curry powder stuck to the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add lentils and remaining 1 can of vegetable broth; cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir cilantro into lentils before serving.",
