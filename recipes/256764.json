    "des": "\"Oregon has more breweries per capita than any other state. As a result, it's no surprise this Oregon-inspired dip includes beer in the recipe! Using your favorite brew (we recommend an IPA), mixed with McCormick\u00c2\u00ae Cheesy Taco Seasoning Mix and Cheddar and Swiss cheeses, it's tailgate-ready in a half an hour. Pretzels make the perfect dippers, along with crusty bread or chips.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in large saucepan on medium heat. Sprinkle with flour and Seasoning Mix. Cook and stir 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk and beer until smooth. Stirring constantly, cook 5 minutes or until sauce starts to thicken. Gradually whisk in cheeses until melted and smooth.\nTransfer cheese mixture to warm fondue pot or slow cooker to keep warm, if desired.",
