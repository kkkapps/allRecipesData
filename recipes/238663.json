    "des": "\"You'll find some of the most versatile vegetables simmering in a pot of thick Irish beer that, when thickened with flour and sweetened with a bit of brown sugar and soy sauce, becomes a rich and flavorful stew. Serve when it's cold or when you're looking for a hearty stew that will satisfy vegetarian and non-vegetarians alike! Make sure to get the regular beer, not stout!\"",

Saute seitan in hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.\nHeat remaining olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion, celery, carrots, potatoes, and garlic in hot oil until onions are soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and slowly stir beer into vegetable mixture.\nStir brown sugar, flour, thyme, salt, and black pepper into beer mixture; add seitan. Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until stew reduces and thickens, about 45 minutes.",
