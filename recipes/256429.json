    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Oil an 8x8 inch baking pan and line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.\nSpread the almonds on a baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, about 8 minutes. Let cool. On the same baking sheet, spread out the coconut and bake until lightly golden brown, about 4 minutes.\nPlace the Amazin Diced Prunes in a bowl and pour enough lukewarm water to cover and let them soak for 5 minutes. Drain well. In a bowl, mix together the flour, oats, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Stir in the almonds and coconut. Stir in the butter until a batter forms, then stir in the Amazin Diced Prunes and chocolate chips until evenly incorporated.\nPress the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 25 minutes or until the top is lightly browned. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Unmold and cool completely. Once cool, cut into 16 (2x2 inch) bars.",
