    "des": "\"I decided to try a sort of hot bacon and bean relish by slicing beans thin and cooking them raw in hot bacon fat. I used a little lemon loved how this came out with the seared halibut.\"",
    "ins": "Season halibut steaks generously with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate until needed.\nPlace bacon in a skillet and cook over medium heat. When bacon is about half cooked, 4 to 6 minutes, stir in beans and pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until bacon is crisp and beans are almost tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer bacon and beans to a bowl and return skillet with bacon drippings to the stove over medium-high heat.\nWhen bacon drippings just begin to smoke, place 2 halibut steaks in the skillet; cook until browned and meat is just starting to pull away from the bone, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a plate and repeat for remaining 2 steaks.\nRemove skillet from heat and pour in water; bring to a boil while scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Return beans and bacon to the skillet and stir in lemon juice; cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon hot bean and bacon relish over halibut steaks and serve.",
