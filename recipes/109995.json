    "ins": "Place raisins into a heatproof bowl and pour in enough boiling water to cover.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, or a plate to seal; allow to stand overnight.\nDissolve sugar in the lukewarm water in a small bowl.  Sprinkle yeast over the water and allow to soften and bubble, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, heat the milk, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat until the butter melts.  Remove from the heat and allow to cool until lukewarm (105 to 110 degrees F).\nOnce the milk has cooled, drain the raisins, and add them to the milk.  Stir in the yeast mixture and molasses.  In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, mace, and clove.  Stir half of the flour into the milk mixture with a wooden spoon and beat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add remaining flour and stir until a moist dough is formed.\nPlace dough on a flat surface and knead until dough becomes smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking.  Place into a large, oiled bowl; cover, and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nLightly oil or grease two loaf pans and set aside.  Divide dough in half and shape into 2 loaves, place into prepared pans, cover, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake loaves in preheated oven 1 hour, or until they are nicely browned and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.",
