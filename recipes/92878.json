    "des": "\"I invented this easy no-bake recipe because of a bake sale at work, combined with my boredom with the usual rice cereal version.

Remove from heat; stir in the honey graham cereal. Press the mixture evenly into the prepared pan with a greased spatula. Allow to cool; cut into squares to serve.",
