    "des": "\"I recently needed a recipe for raspberry vinegar and as I had a bowl of raspberries in the house, I thought it couldn't be that hard to make it myself. The result is great and I'm looking forward to my next salad! Store in a dark place so that the vinegar does not get discolored.\"",
    "ins": "Mash raspberries with a fork in a bowl. Pour in vinegar; mix well to combine. Transfer to a glass container with a lid; cover and let stand until flavors combine, about 24 hours.\nStrain vinegar through a fine sieve into a bowl; discard raspberry pieces. Strain vinegar again through a coffee filter into a clean bottle and seal tightly.",
