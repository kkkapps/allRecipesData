    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nMeanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter over medium heat; cook eggs sunny-side up (so that egg yolks are not broken). Sprinkle garlic powder, ground black pepper, onion and rosemary on eggs while cooking.\nPlace hot pasta and cooked eggs on a plate and stir together; the broken yolks will create the sauce. Serve hot.",
