    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCombine ground chuck, bread crumbs, egg, onion soup mix, water, and black pepper in a bowl; press into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Prick holes through the chuck mixture for ventilation while cooking.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain excess grease.\nCut chuck mixture into squares the size of the rolls. Place 1 chuck patty in each roll.",
