    "des": "\"This is a great recipe that the whole family will love (even your meat eaters). Serve it with brown rice and steamed veggies for a healthy vegan meal any night of the week. Start the marinating process the evening before you intend to cook it. I doubled this recipe in order to have leftovers for lunch. Simply reheat it with potatoes or rice. You can also serve it cold on a salad or as filling for a sandwich.\"",

Place a heavy plate on top; add a few books to the plate to press the tofu and drain excess liquid, 20 to 30 minutes.\nUnwrap tofu and slice into 2-inch slices that are 1/4-inch thick. Arrange slices in a large, shallow baking dish.\nCombine liquid aminos, canola oil, lemon juice, agave nectar, garlic, thyme, ginger paste, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; blend until smooth.
