    "des": "\"A refreshing drink on a hot summer day. Add club soda and some rum for an adult-only version! Great to make up a few batches ahead of time and keep in the fridge for large gatherings. It goes quickly! Garnish punch bowl with mint, lemon, and lime slices if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Place tea bags and mint sprigs in a large heat-proof measuring cup. Pour boiling water over tea bag mixture and cover measuring cup with a small plate. Steep tea until desired strength is reached, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour steeped tea through a strainer into a large mason jar, squeezing excess liquid from tea bags. Discard mint and tea bags.\nStir sugar into tea until dissolved; add lemon juice, lime juice, and vanilla extract. Stir cold water into tea mixture. Place lid on the jar and refrigerate until completely chilled, 2 hours to overnight.\nFill a punch bowl or drink dispenser with ice and add tea.",
