    "des": "\"Yummy, moist, tasty turkey! I combined two of my favorite turkey recipes to make this one superb apple flavored roast turkey with stuffing.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGently loosen the turkey skin on the breast by sliding your hand between the skin and bird. Insert pieces of butter between the skin and breast.\nIn a medium bowl, toss together the celery, bread cubes, and onion. Season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Stuff this mixture into the cavity of the turkey, and place the apple halves inside with it. Place the turkey into a roasting bag, and pour the apple juice over the inside and outside of the turkey. Close the bag, and place turkey into a large roasting pan breast side up.\nBake for 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature is 180 degrees F (85 degrees C) when measured in the meatiest part of the thigh. Open the bag, and remove turkey to a serving platter. Let stand for 20 minutes before carving.",
