    "ins": "Place  pork chops, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and black pepper into a large, resealable, plastic bag.  Shake the bag gently to combine everything, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  These are excellent  done in the morning, and left to sit all day.\nHeat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a shallow dish, combine bread crumbs and sesame seeds.   Remove chops from marinade, making sure there are no ginger slices clinging to the meat, and lay them in the crumb mixture to coat.  If you like, place pieces of garlic from the marinade on the chops.  Place chops on a rack or baking sheet.\nBake for approximately 45 minutes, or until done",
