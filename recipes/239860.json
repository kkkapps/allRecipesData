    "des": "\"Traditional zucchini bread using some healthy alternatives but still moist and delicious. If loaves get too dark when cooking, cover the loaf pans with aluminum foil.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans.\nWhisk flour, flax, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat white sugar, vegetable oil, applesauce, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is well-mixed. Fold zucchini and chocolate chips into batter; pour batter into prepared loaf pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing loaves from pans.",
