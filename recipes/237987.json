If you want to use for a dip for pretzels, one batch should be enough. I recommend crushing the pretzels using a rolling pin. I recommend not to add pretzel mixture to pineapple mixture until ready to serve.\"",
    "ins": "Mix cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar together in a bowl; add pineapple and mix well. Fold whipped topping into pineapple mixture; refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.\nCombine pretzels, butter, and 1/3 cup sugar in a bowl until evenly coated; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until pretzel mixture holds together like toffee, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pan from oven and cool. Break pretzel mixture into pieces and mix into pineapple mixture.",
