    "des": "\"I took my 3-year-old fishing for the first time and we caught two trout. I never made trout before. I literally made this recipe up as I went, with what I found in the kitchen. I checked other recipes to get cooking times. I went a little longer on the cooking time because of the bacon. I'm only posting this because the entire family loved it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with foil.\nPlace a small saucepan over low heat; heat butter until partially melted. Stir in lemon juice, jalapeno pepper, green onion, and garlic; stir mixture into a paste. Season with sea salt and black pepper.\nPlace each trout onto a large sheet of aluminum foil and stuff the cavity of each fish with butter paste; place a dill sprig and a bacon strip into the cavity over the butter mixture. Fold foil over fish and wrap edges to seal tightly. Place foil packets in the prepared baking dish.\nBake foil packets until fish flakes easily with a fork, 26 minutes. Let fish sit in foil packet for 5 minutes before unwrapping. To serve, transfer fish from foil to a serving plate; discard bacon. Flesh of fish will be white and skin will peel off.",
