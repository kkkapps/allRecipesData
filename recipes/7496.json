    "des": "\"If you like peanut butter you'll love this frosting, great on chocolate cakes but for a real peanut butter experience try it on a peanut butter cake.  If you don't have cream, you may substitute milk.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, beat butter and peanut butter until light and fluffy. Slowly beat in 1/2 of  the confectioner's sugar. Mix in 1/4 cup of the cream. Beat in the remaining confectioners' sugar. If necessary, add a little more cream or milk until the frosting reaches a good spreading consistency. Makes enough to frost one 2 layer 9 inch cake or one 9x13 inch cake.",
