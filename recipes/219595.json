    "des": "\"This recipe is for a sweet 'sage' cream sauce that we serve over butternut squash ravioli. This sauce has a unique taste that we first tried at a local Italian restaurant. This is our version of their sage cream sauce (even though we don't use sage in our recipe). It is basically all the sweetest tastes of Thanksgiving in a ravioli dish. If you prefer a thinner sauce, add a little more cream.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter with the cooking oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix the rosemary, thyme, and flour into the butter mixture; cook and stir until smooth, bubbling, and turns a light tan color, 10 to 15 minutes.\nStir the heavy cream into the flour mixture a little at a time, allowing each addition to incorporate fully before adding more. Stir the nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, salt, and pepper into the cream mixture; cook and stir until smooth.",
