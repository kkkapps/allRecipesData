    "des": "\"Similar to deep fried calamari, crispy strips of tripe make an unusual, but delicious appetizer.\"",
    "ins": "Place the tripe into a large pot, and cover with a lot of water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 1/2 hours. Drain, then rinse well with cold water. Drain in a colander, squeezing out the excess water.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBeat together the egg, barbeque sauce, and milk in a mixing bowl. Stir in the flour, and mix until no dry lumps remain. Season with garlic powder, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\nDip the pieces of tripe into the egg batter, and allow the excess to drip off. Deep fry the tripe in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Allow the tripe to drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.",
