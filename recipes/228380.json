    "des": "\"These are a heartier version of the traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes. Using spelt flour, which is higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate, is a very nice change. The cookies are easy to make and are delicious!\n Spelt flour is now available in many grocery stores and all health food stores. Try adding sunflower seeds, almonds, shredded coconut, or oats to the batter for something different!\"",
