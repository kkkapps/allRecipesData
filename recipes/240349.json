    "des": "\"Crunchy tender scones with a sweet/tart flavor. I've have successfully substituted whole wheat pastry flour, soy milk, and vanilla paste. When I use a dark baking sheet or a glass baking dish, I reduce the temperature of the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nStir flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.\nStir pomegranate seeds, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice together in a bowl until seeds are coated with sugar.\nBeat egg in a bowl; stir in almond milk, butter, vinegar, and vanilla. Pour egg mixture into pomegranate mixture and stir to combine. Stir egg and pomegranate mixture into flour mixture to make a soft dough.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. If dough is too sticky, sprinkle with a bit of cornstarch. Roll or pat dough into a 3/4-inch thick round; cut into wedges and transfer to a baking sheet. Sprinkle dough with 1 tablespoon sugar.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
