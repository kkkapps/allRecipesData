    "des": "\"A great soup. Healthy (despite the cream) and refreshing! For a South American flair, serve with popcorn. Throw it into your soup and like you would croutons. Serve hot or cold. The addition of finely diced fennel fronds dresses up the presentation.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add fennel; cook and stir until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in leeks; cook until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add potatoes and broth. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes.\nPuree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Add carrots and red bell pepper; simmer until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in heavy cream and anise-flavored liqueur. Season with salt and white pepper.",
