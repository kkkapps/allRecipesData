    "des": "\"I actually double the marinade if making it for just my husband and I as we love it so much.  When we serve this for guests we keep the lobster as the main attraction, and pair it with a simple green salad with a light dressing, crusty bread, melted butter in heated ramekins for dipping, and a bottle of cold Chardonnay.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate.\nMelt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the lemon juice, orange zest, ginger, chili powder, and bitters. Simmer gently for 2 minutes, then set aside. Cut away the membrane on the underside of the lobster tails, and insert a metal skewer into each one. This will prevent them from curling up as they cook.\nCook the lobster tails shell-side up on the preheated grill for 10 minutes, then turn the tails over, and spoon the butter sauce over the meat. Continue cooking until the meat is no longer translucent in the middle, about 10 minutes more.",
