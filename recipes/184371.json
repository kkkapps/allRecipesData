    "des": "\"Made with hard boiled egg yolks to add a twist of body and flavor to the usual cookie press spritz!\"",
    "ins": "Place the eggs into a saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water; cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel eggs, separate yolks from whites. Sieve or finely grate yolks. Reserve whites for another use.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBeat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the egg yolks and the almond extract. Slowly mix in the flour, just until incorporated. Use a spritz style cookie maker to press cookies onto prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven just until the edges begin to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.",
