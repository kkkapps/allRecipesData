    "des": "\"Chicken breasts slow cooked with a creamy white wine and mushroom mixture. This quick and easy recipe calls for just five main ingredients, yet is tasty enough to serve for company! My husband normally doesn't like chicken, yet asks for seconds whenever I prepare this. I spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve with rice or noodles.\"",
