Set aside for 5 minutes and then stir until smooth.\nIn a large bowl, mix together cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time.  Remove approximately 1 1/2 cup of this batter and place into a smaller bowl and add 1/2 cup raspberry puree. Blend until combined.  Add the melted chocolate to the remaining batter and mix until combined. Pour the chocolate cheesecake batter into the pan.  Very carefully layer the raspberry cheesecake mixture on top of the chocolate mixture. Bake for 60 to 75 minutes, or until filling is set.
