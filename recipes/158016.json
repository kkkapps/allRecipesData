    "des": "\"When I was very young, my grandparents frequently took us to eat at a cafeteria in North Hollywood, CA. I liked -- no I loved -- only one dish. It was their stuffed bell peppers. Part of what made them unique was their juices and sauce: it was tomato based but very translucent with a slightly sweet and tangy taste. I have yet to recreate the sauce but have developed a substitute which isn't too bad. However, I have in fact finally made the stuffing taste just like I remember it. I hope you enjoy this as much as my family does.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and ground lamb; cook and stir until the onion is tender, and the meat is no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the rice, salt, black pepper, and mint; cook 5 minutes longer. Add the water and parsley. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the water has been completely absorbed by the rice, about 15 minutes. Stir the chicken broth and diced tomatoes together in an oven-proof dish that will just fit the peppers. Scoop the lamb mixture into the bell peppers, and place them into the dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the peppers are tender and the tomatoes are bubbly, about 45 minutes.",
