    "des": "\"When I was young I loved this recipe!   And I must admit that I still love it a lot! It's an easy no-baking sweet that every kid will enjoy both to make and to eat!  If the dough is too hard you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk or melted butter.  This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.\"",
    "ins": "With electric mixer, beat sugar and egg yolk in medium bowl, 3 to 4 minutes.  Beat in whole egg until fluffy, 10 to 15 minutes more.  Beat in melted butter until smooth.  Stir in cocoa, crushed cookies and almonds.  Shape dough into a long sausage shape, wrap in waxed paper or plastic wrap and place on a baking sheet.  Freeze 4 hours, until firm.  Serve in thick slices.",
