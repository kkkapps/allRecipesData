    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.\nMix ground sirloin, whiskey, Worcestershire sauce, cola, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl until just combined. Shape meat mixture into 8 evenly sized, 1-inch thick patties. Make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nArrange patties indented-side up on preheated grill. Cook burgers until hot and slightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Place a slice of Cheddar cheese on each burger for the last minute of cooking and top with 2 slices bacon. Place burgers on buns.",
