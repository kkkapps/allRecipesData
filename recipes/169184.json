    "des": "\"Who knew it was so quick and easy to make excellent gourmet-style popcorn? This recipe produces a very tasty snack. Popcorn was the last thing I used my microwave to cook. Now its retired. This is my personal favorite flavor combo, but you can vary the spices to suit your mood. A favorite combination for movie night with the girls is garlic powder and dried cilantro... Yum!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the coconut oil, agave nectar, and chipotle powder in a large saucepan or soup pot over medium-high heat. Once the mixture starts to form tiny bubbles, pour in the popcorn, and use a fork to stir it around to coat the kernels. Place the lid on the pan. When the corn starts to pop, shake the pan constantly until the popping stops. Remove from heat, and pour popped corn into a large bowl.",
