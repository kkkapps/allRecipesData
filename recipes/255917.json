    "des": "\"In El Salvador there are pupusas. In Mexico there are tacos. In Honduras there are Baleadas. The simple version consists of a thick flour \u00c2\u2013 though sometimes corn \u00c2\u2013 tortilla that has been put on a charcoal grill. It's slathered in refried black beans and a bit of white farmers cheese then folded over like an American-style soft taco.\"",
    "ins": "Mix flour, water, vegetable oil, egg, and salt in a large bowl; knead until dough is smooth and no longer sticky.\nForm the dough into 8 golf ball-sized balls. Cover and let rest, about 20 minutes.\nStretch each ball of dough into a thick tortilla.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla until browned and lightly puffed, about 1 minute per side.\nLayer refried beans, avocado, and queso fresco over tortillas. Drizzle crema on top; fold tortillas in half over filling.",
