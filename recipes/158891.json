While this is not the traditional Jap Chae that includes meats and vegetables, this one is sweet and delightful. Great served as an appetizer or a side dish to chicken and meat! Enjoy.\"",

Cover with hot tap water and soak for ten minutes; drain.\nWhisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, and boiling water; pour over the drained noodles; allow to soak 2 minutes.\nPour the vegetable oil into a skillet and place over medium heat. Add the noodles and soy sauce mixture to the skillet and cook and stir until hot, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the noodles just before serving.",
