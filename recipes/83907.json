Mix in the potatoes, and cook until they begin to turn translucent, about 10 minutes more. Stir in the chicken broth, and season with oregano, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, and simmer over low heat until the potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Pour in the cream-style corn and whole kernel corn, and cook for 10 more minutes.\nStir in the cream, Monterey Jack cheese, and Cheddar cheese over low heat until the soup is hot and the cheeses have melted. Do not boil. Remove from the heat, and serve.",
