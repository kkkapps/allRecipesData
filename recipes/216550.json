    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rub the soaked cedar plank with 1/2 teaspoon of butter.\nUse a paring knife to pierce the sweet potatoes in several spots to a depth of 1/2-inch. Cook the sweet potatoes in a microwave on High until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Peel the potatoes, and place into a mixing bowl. Add 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, the yogurt, and roasted garlic. Mash until smooth. Mound the potatoes onto the cedar plank.\nBake in the preheated oven until a golden brown crust forms on the potatoes, about 30 minutes. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of melted butter, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Sprinkle with parsley, onion, paprika, and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese to serve.",
