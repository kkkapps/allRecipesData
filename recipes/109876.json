    "des": "\"My husband does not like baked beans but can't get enough of these.  They are loaded with a variety of meats and get a little bit of sweetness from molasses and brown sugar. If you don't have a slow cooker, you can bake them in the oven until heated through. \"",
    "ins": "Crumble the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain off grease and transfer the beef to a 4 quart or larger slow cooker. Stir in the baked beans, bacon, ham, onion, chili powder, ketchup, brown sugar and molasses. If it seems thick, stir in the water. Cover and cook on High for 3 hours or cook for 6 to 8 hours on Low.",
