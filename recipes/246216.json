    "des": "\"Frozen bread dough and vanilla pudding make these caramel rolls a snap to make. Gooey and delicious! You can make other flavored rolls by substituting the vanilla pudding with flavored gelatin packets (such as Jell-O\u00c2\u00ae).\"",
    "ins": "Cut bread dough into 32 equal slices. Place slices in a single layer in baking dish.\nCombine nuts, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla pudding mix, and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over dough slices. Cut 1/2 cup butter into slices, distribute on dough. Let rolls rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until sugar is brown and bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the baking dish for 5 minutes before carefully invert baking dish onto a work surface and gently tap bottom to release rolls.",
