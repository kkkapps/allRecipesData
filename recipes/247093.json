    "des": "\"Seeing the juicy pork chops in my friend Jennifer Yu's blog post (Use Real Butter) inspired this recipe, which features one of my favorite getting-meat-ready-for-the-grill techniques of all time. If you can call sprinkling salt on pork chops a technique. As long as you don't horribly overcook your meat, this 'dry-brine' technique will produce the juiciest and most flavorful pork chops you've ever had.\"",
    "ins": "Mix kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl to make the dry brine. Generously apply mixture to both sides of pork chops. Transfer chops to a rack on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered 18 to 24 hours.\nPreheat grill to medium or medium-high heat. Brush pork chops on each side with a few drops of vegetable oil.\nGrill chops until internal temperature reaches 135 degrees F (60 degrees C), turning to evenly brown on each side. Transfer to platter and allow to rest 5 minutes.",
