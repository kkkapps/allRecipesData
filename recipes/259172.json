These potatoes will step up your breakfast game and have everyone beg you to make them again and again! This also makes a wonderful breakfast dish; just serve alongside some eggs and bacon and you are all set!\"",
    "ins": "Melt duck fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add potatoes; cook, stirring minimally, until potatoes are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess fat.\nCombine parsley, salt, and white pepper in a bowl; toss over cooked potatoes to coat evenly.",
