    "des": "\"We had some beautiful tilapia fillets, but no recipes! I had recently bought some amazing sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, and decided to invent a slightly Mediterranean fish dish for a quick weeknight dinner.  My husband is a recipe purist, always follows them to the letter, but after this, he's learned to trust my inventions!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together the sun-dried tomatoes, olives and capers. Set aside.\nPlace the tilapia fillets side by side in a baking dish. Drizzle with oil and lemon juice.\nBake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the fish flakes with a fork. Check after 10 minutes, so as not to overcook, or the fish may be dry.  When fish is done, top with the tomato mixture, and serve.",
