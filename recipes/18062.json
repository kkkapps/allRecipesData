    "ins": "Leave tofu in original package and place in freezer for 72 hours.\nBring a pot of water to a simmer. Place package of tofu in water and allow to thaw, approximately 10 minutes. When thawed, remove from package, place in a piece of cheesecloth, and squeeze out liquid. Shred, dice, or slice tofu and include in your favorite recipe.",
