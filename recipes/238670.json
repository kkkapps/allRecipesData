    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey, onion, soy sauce, and garlic in the hot skillet until turkey is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir taco seasoning mix into the turkey mixture.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.\nDrain rotini and return to the pot; place over low heat. Stir milk and butter with the rotini; cook until the butter melts completely, 2 to 3 minutes; add turkey mixture and stir. Sprinkle cheese over the rotini-and-turkey mixture; cook and stir until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.",
