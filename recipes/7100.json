    "ins": "In a saucepan, heat milk, water, and butter or margarine until warm.\nIn large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, yeast, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, mace, and cloves; mix well.   Stir in warm milk mixture and  egg.  Blend with an electric mixer at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.  By hand, stir in raisins, cherries, citron, nuts, and enough remaining flour to make a firm dough.\nKnead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover.   Let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.\nPunch dough down.  Shape into a round loaf, and place in a greased 2 quart casserole.  Cover, and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Brush top of loaf with melted butter, and sprinkle lightly with 1 teaspoon sugar.\nBake at 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes, until deep golden brown.  If too dark, cover loosely with foil last 5 to 10 minutes of baking.  Cool.",
