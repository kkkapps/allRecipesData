The cherries can be ordered on-line these days, which makes it much easier for those of us living where cherries are not readily available.  Regular milk can be substituted for buttermilk, if necessary.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine the chicken, dried cherries, celery, nuts, mayonnaise, milk, salt and pepper and apple if desired. Toss together well and refrigerate until chilled. Serve on toasted cracked wheat bread or croissants.",
