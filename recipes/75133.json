    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the tops off of garlic heads so the tip of each clove is exposed. Place garlic on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes.\nSet the oven to broil. Slice the loaf of bread in half horizontally, and place cut-side up on a baking sheet.\nSqueeze the cloves of garlic from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in the butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of the bread.\nBroil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.",
