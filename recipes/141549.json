    "des": "\"Simple Potlatch fare, comes from the fruits of the earth and sea. Here, pureed pumpkin and canned cream corn simplifies the otherwise tedious preparation, and may be spiced up to your liking or left mellow and earthy.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the pumpkin and creamed corn in a blender; pulse to puree the mixture for 1 minute or until smooth. Add the milk and continue to pulse the mixture for another minute, or until well combined. Pour pumpkin mixture into a 3 to 4 quart saucepan over medium heat.\nImmediately stir in the broth, apple cider, water, butter, and ground mace. Heat for  15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Salt and pepper to taste. Add thawed corn kernels and cook for an additional 5 minutes.",
