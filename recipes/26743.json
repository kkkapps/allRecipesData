    "ins": "In a small bowl, mix together butter, pimento peppers, shallots, ground black pepper and seasoning salt. Form the mixture into a ball shape, and securely wrap with plastic wrap. Place in the freezer approximately 30 minutes, until firm but not solid.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until browned but still tender. Drain and cut each slice into 8 pieces. Bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add clams and cook for 15 to 20 seconds or until open; drain and rinse.\nPreheat the broiler.\nArrange clams on a medium baking sheet. Top each with 1 piece of bacon. Distribute equal portions of the butter mixture onto each clam atop the bacon.\nChecking often to avoid burning, broil the clams 2 to 3 minutes, until the butter mixture has melted and bacon is crisp.",
