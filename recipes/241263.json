    "des": "\"I love the convenience of the slow cooker but I do not care for the sodium content by using cream of mushroom soup etc. Sadly many of today's recipes call for the can of soup. I have tried many recipes over the years and adjusted them and this is the result. Please do use the wine, most of the alcohol dissipates with the cooking.\"",
    "ins": "Combine steak seasoning, salt, thyme, and rosemary together in a bowl; rub onto the roast.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat and place roast in skillet; cook until roast is browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.\nPlace the roast in the slow cooker and add au jus mix and onion soup mix. Pour water and Malbec over roast.\nCook on High for 5 hours (or cook in Low for 8 to 9 hours).",
