Grease an 8x8-inch square pan with cooking spray.\nMix melted butter and graham cracker crumbs together; press into an even layer at the bottom of the pan. Top with chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and marshmallows. Drizzle sweetened condensed milk on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 17 to 20 minutes.\nLet cool, about 30 minutes. To make it easier to cut into bars, cover with plastic wrap and chill, about 30 minutes.",
