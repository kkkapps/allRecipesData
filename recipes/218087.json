    "des": "\"I threw these delicious pork chops together with some extra things from the garden. My 5-year-old daughter named them pizza pork chops because she says they tasted like pizza.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.\nSeason the pork chops with salt and black pepper and arrange in the bottom of a disposable aluminum pan; top each with a tomato slice. Divide the basil, oregano, and garlic between the pork chops; drizzle with the olive oil. Cover the pan with aluminum foil.\nCook on the preheated grill until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove the pan from the grill; top each pork chop with a slice of mozzarella cheese, replace the aluminum foil over the pan, and wait until the cheese melts, 3 to 5 minutes, before serving.",
