Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.\nMix flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.\nBeat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat 1 egg into butter mixture. Beat second egg into mixture along with the vanilla extract; add flour mixture and mix well into a cookie dough. Crumble bacon and add to the dough with the chopped peanut butter cups; fold bacon and peanut butter cup chunks through the dough. Drop peanut butter in small amounts into the dough and swirl into the dough, but not mixing completely to integrate.\nDrop spoonfuls of dough onto baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, about 12 minutes.",
