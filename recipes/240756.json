    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe when I wanted a ginger cookie and didn't have any molasses. This has a delicate flavor, not as strong as your typical ginger cookie or gingerbread, but the vanilla chips give it a great creamy richness that complements the spice. It makes an excellent Christmas cookie, and 1 cup of walnuts can be added for another layer of flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and vanilla extract; mix well.\nWhisk flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and cloves together in another bowl. Beat flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is just-combined. Stir vanilla chips into dough. Drop dough by the 1/8-cup full 2-inches apart on a baking sheet.\nBake cookies in the preheated oven until golden and soft, 10 to 11 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
