    "des": "\"This is a hearty family dish that my mother made for us on chilly nights!  The Italian sausage makes it extra special.\"",
    "ins": "Mix beef and sausage into 1 or 2 flat patties. In a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat, salt patties and brown well on each side. Remove meat and set aside.\nSaute onion and garlic in the drippings.  Remove with a slotted spoon and add to the platter with the meat.\nIn the drippings, carefully brown a single layer of the raw noodles until golden, remove and do another layer until all are done.\nReturn all the noodles to the skillet with the garlic, onions, peppers, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce and water.  Break the meat patty into large chunks, gently stir all together and simmer 1/2 hour or so. Add a little water as the noodles absorb the juices. This should not be soupy, just thick and dry. Stir in the grated cheese and let it melt into the sauce. It sticks easily at this point, so don't overcook. This reheats well in a slow cooker or casserole.",
