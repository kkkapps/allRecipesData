Mrs. Allen gave this recipe to my parents as a wedding gift, as with all my mom's and my dad's brothers and sisters. It is a true family recipe. This recipe is fantastic because you can prepare the night before, then put it in the oven while, say, opening gifts. No work required the day of.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a skillet over medium high heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.\nSpread 1 side of each bread slice with about 1 teaspoon butter. Arrange 1/2 the slices buttered side down in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with the crumbled bacon, 1/2 the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 the Monterey Jack cheese. Arrange remaining bread slices over the cheese, buttered sides up. In a small bowl, mix the eggs and milk, and pour evenly over bread slices. Top with remaining cheese. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake the chilled Brunch Bake 1 hour, or until cheese is bubbly and eggs are set.",
