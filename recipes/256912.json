    "des": "\"Bison (aka buffalo) meat is one of the healthiest proteins around. It has more Omega-3 fatty acids than even salmon and it's lower in fat and cholesterol than boneless, skinless chicken breast. The best part? It's absolutely delicious. Topped with a smoky sauce and dill pickles, this burger is a taste of the American West. Serve pinto beans, cheesy corn casserole or steak-cut fries alongside.\"",
    "ins": "To make the sauce, combine ketchup with ground chile, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, onion powder, salt, cumin and mustard.\nWhisk well and set aside.\nTo prepare burgers, mix the ground bison with seasonings in a large bowl.\nShape 8 patties of equal size and brush each with half of the olive oil.\nIn a large skillet, add reserved olive oil and heat until smoking over medium-high heat.\nCook 4 patties, covered, for 5 minutes. Turn and cook another 5 minutes, covered. (Add cheese, if desired, for the last 1 minute of cooking.)\nRemove to a warm platter and cover while you cook the remaining patties.\nKeeping the skillet warm, brush the buns with olive oil and toast on either side for about 10 to 15 seconds.\nAssemble burgers by placing cooked patties on bun bottoms, topping with smoky sauce and pickles, along with desired burger toppings.",
