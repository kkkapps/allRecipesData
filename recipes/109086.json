    "des": "\"This is an utterly simple dish that's great for getting rid of all that extra rhubarb! Any fruit can be used, not just rhubarb. Just substitute sweetened fresh fruit or a can of pie filling. Serve with whipped cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of flour. Add rhubarb and toss to coat; set aside.\nMelt the butter in a 2-quart casserole dish or other deep baking dish. In a large bowl, whisk the remaining 1 cup of flour, 1 cup sugar, and baking powder. Stir in milk until batter is smooth. Pour the batter over the melted butter and spread gently so that butter stays on the bottom. Arrange the rhubarb in an even layer on top of the batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until batter has risen up through the fruit and the top is golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes. Test with a long skewer to see if cake is cooked through.",
