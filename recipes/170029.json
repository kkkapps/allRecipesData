    "des": "\"This sauce is very hot, but not too insane. For maximum heat increase habaneros as desired.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a sauce pan over medium heat. Cook and stir the carrots, oil, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until soft, about 5 minutes; transfer to a blender. Add the whole habanero peppers, water, lime juice, white vinegar, and tomato to blender; blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nTransfer mixture to a saucepan, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. This gives the sauce a more liquid consistency.",
