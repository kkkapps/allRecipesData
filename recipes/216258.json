    "ins": "Bring the brown rice and 1 1/2 cup of water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and almost all the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Mash the cranberry sauce in a small bowl with a fork until almost smooth, and stir the sauce into the brown rice, mixing well to tint the rice a slight pink color. Cover, and let steam for about 5 minutes.\nPlace the dried cranberries into a microwave-safe bowl, and cook on high setting in a microwave oven just until hot, about 30 seconds. Stir the cranberries into the rice. Season to taste with salt and black pepper; serve sprinkled with pecans.",
