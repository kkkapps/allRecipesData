    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and brown the pork chops on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Place the chops into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nMix the sauerkraut, apple, onion, brown sugar, and caraway seeds in a bowl until well combined, and spread the sauerkraut mixture over the pork chops. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the pork is no longer pink inside, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
