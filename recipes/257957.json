    "des": "\"A delicious holiday cookie dessert! These little delights are also called tassies, which comes from the archaic Scottish for cups. A perfect little bite of holiday flavor \u00c2\u2013 crunchy and sticky and sweet, with a mild buttery crust. These little beauties are relatively easy to make, look wonderfully impressive, travel well, and freeze beautifully.\"",
    "ins": "Combine 1 1/2 cup softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in flour until dough comes together. Wrap dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray three 24-cup mini muffin tins with cooking spray.\nCombine brown sugar, eggs, 1/4 cup melted butter, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl to make filling; beat with an electric mixer until smooth.\nShape chilled dough into 1-inch balls. Press 1 ball of dough over the bottom and up the sides of each muffin cup. Spoon 1 teaspoon walnuts over the dough. Drop 1 teaspoonful of the filling on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to turn golden and the filling is bubbling slightly, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
