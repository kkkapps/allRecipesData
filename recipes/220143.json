    "des": "\"Quick and easy meal that is also easy on the taste buds! It is cheap to make and serves great as leftovers. This recipe makes over 2 servings, enough for seconds or leftovers. As shortcuts I use frozen white rice and veggies (1 package) and a stir fry medley from the produce section or sometimes the freezer aisle.\"",
    "ins": "Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow rice to stand covered while you finish the remaining steps.\nHeat olive oil, garlic salt, black pepper, and parsley in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.\nCook and stir chicken strips in olive oil until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes.\nStir in broccoli, carrots, and snap peas; cover the skillet, and cook until carrots are tender, 5 to 8 minutes.\nStir condensed Cheddar cheese soup into chicken and vegetables; mix well and bring to a simmer. Cook and stir until chicken and vegetables are coated with sauce.\nTo serve, mound cooked rice on a platter, and top with chicken and vegetables in sauce. Sprinkle with shredded Cheddar cheese to serve.",
