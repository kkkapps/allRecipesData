    "ins": "In large mixing bowl, soak bread crumbs in milk for 5 minutes. Mix in meat, eggs, and chopped onions. Season with cardamom and salt and pepper to taste. Roll into 1 to 1 1/2 inch meatballs.\nSaute meatballs in 1/4 cup butter for approximately 20 minutes.\nIn a separate skillet, saute sliced onions with 1/4 cup butter and sugar until caramelized, about 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nRemove mixtures (the meatballs and the onions) from both pans, and place on separate plates. Deglaze both saute pans with the remaining 1/2 cup butter and beef broth, scraping up the browned bits. Cook over high heat for 1 minute.\nPlace the contents of both saute pans into one large pot, and stir in the cream and onions. Season with gravy maker seasoning, monosodium glutamate, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves. Bring to a simmer. Make a slurry with cornstarch and water; whisk the slurry into the cream sauce.  Add meatballs, and simmer approximately 20 to 30 minutes.",
