    "des": "\"This is Mexican street food at its finest. Anytime I visit El Paso or Mexico the craving of elote en vaso steps into high gear. Now anytime I crave this I whip it up at home, except I make it fancy by serving it in a pretty glass instead of the traditional Styrofoam\u00c2\u00ae cup. No matter how you serve it the taste is sweet, crunchy, fiery, and juicy.  This is a very loose recipe. Feel free to adjust the proportions of lime juice, crema, cheese, and spices to taste!\"",
