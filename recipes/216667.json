    "des": "\"I was fed up with searching for tasty slow cooker pinto recipes, so I mixed and matched and came up with my own. This recipe is fresh from bachelorhood, yet so good. Imagine the warm goodness of semi-spicy pintos oozing over steaming brown rice and cheese. It's the perfect combo of flavor and value. Enjoy, and let me know how it can be improved! \"",
    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat; crumble bacon when cool.\nBring water to a boil in a large saucepan, and stir in pinto beans. Simmer over medium-low heat until the beans soften, about 30 minutes; pour beans and water into a slow cooker. Stir in the bacon and bacon drippings, kielbasa, ranch-style beans, tomato paste, dried onion, apple cider vinegar, pickled jalapeno, sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Set the cooker to Low, and cook until pinto beans are very tender, 9 to 10 hours.\nAbout 5 minutes before serving, stir in chopped green pepper. Serve topped with chopped green onion.",
