    "des": "\"Other versions of this recipe I've found online were too sweet and too fatty for me.  Here's a stripped-down, super-easy, slightly spiced-up version that's quick enough to make on a work night. I want to try this with tequila in the sauce sometime instead of white wine.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the shallot; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mango, honey 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine, red pepper flakes, and salt. Reduce heat, and simmer until liquid has reduced slightly, about 10 minutes.\nBrush both sides of the grouper fillets with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and season with salt and white pepper.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange grouper fillets on the skillet and cook until the fish is opaque and separates easily under a fork, about 4 minutes on each side. Serve the fish with the mango sauce on top.",
