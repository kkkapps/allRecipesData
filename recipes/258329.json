Measure 1 cup mixture, reserving the rest in a large container with a lid in the refrigerator for another use.\nMix the 1 cup flour-coconut oil mixture, milk, and egg together in a bowl until batter is well mixed.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes.
