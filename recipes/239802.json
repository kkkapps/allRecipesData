    "des": "\"These cookies are gluten-free, and have great taste and texture, like better gourmet cookies. The flour is entirely chickpea with a touch of corn starch. The peanut butter removes the strange chickpea-flour taste. A little extra vanilla wouldn't hurt things either. These are really good!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nBeat brown sugar, butter, peanut butter, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.\nWhisk chickpea flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture. Stir chocolate, oats, and walnuts into peanut butter mixture until dough is evenly combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough until chilled, about 15 minutes.\nForm dough into tablespoon-sized balls and place 2-inches apart on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until brown, about 12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet for 3 to 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
