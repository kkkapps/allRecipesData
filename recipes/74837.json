    "des": "\"A fabulous blueberry coffee cake with a crumb topping. This recipe is one from a local B&B that I replaced all the sugar with substitutes because I have diabetes. I have received all praise and 'I can't believe it is sugar free.'  The sugar can be put back in if you want. Either way it is wonderful.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the melted butter, milk, eggs, vanilla and 1 1/2 cups sugar substitute. Combine 3 cups of flour and baking powder; stir into the wet ingredients until just blended. Fold in the blueberries. Spread evenly in the prepared pan.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar substitute, 3/4 cup of flour, and cinnamon. Stir in the softened butter with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle over the top of the cake.\nBake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  This cake is best served warm.",
