    "ins": "Mix gelatin and water in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently until gelatin is dissolved and mixture is warm, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPour eggnog into a large bowl; gradually stir gelatin mixture into eggnog. Refrigerate eggnog-gelatin mixture until thickened, 2 to 3 hours.\nBeat eggnog mixture with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.\nBeat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar and nutmeg, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Fold egg white mixture into eggnog mixture.\nPour eggnog pudding into a serving bowl and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Spoon pudding into 8 individual serving bowls; add raspberries to each serving.",
