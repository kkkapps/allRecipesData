Place rounds between sheets of plastic wrap and pound until thin.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nBeat eggs and milk together and pour into a shallow dish or bowl. Set aside. In a separate dish or bowl combine breadcrumbs with garlic salt, oregano, salt and pepper. Mix all together. In a large skillet heat oil over medium high heat. Meanwhile, dip tenderloins in egg mixture, then coat with bread crumb mixture. When oil is hot, add coated tenderloin to skillet and fry until golden brown on both sides (not cooked through)!\nPlace browned tenderloin in a 9x13 inch baking dish lined with aluminum foil. Fry any leftover eggs and bread crumbs together for 'breadings'. Add 'breadings' to baking dish.
