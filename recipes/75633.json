    "des": "\"Growing up, my Mexican grandmother always had a pot of beans cooking on the stove.  I often cook these beans (a 'drunken' version) for my family, and the aroma keeps her close to my soul, even years after she has past. I hope your family enjoys them as much as mine.\"",
    "ins": "Soak beans in a large pot of water overnight.\nDrain beans, and refill the pot with chicken stock and enough water to cover the beans with 2 inches of liquid. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Stir the beans occasionally through out the entire cooking process to make sure they do not burn or stick to the bottom of the pot.\nStir beer, tomatoes, onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic, bay leaves, oregano, and cilantro into the beans. Continue to cook uncovered for 1 hour, or until beans are tender.\nWith a potato masher, crush the beans slightly to thicken the bean liquid. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper to taste.",
