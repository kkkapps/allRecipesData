    "ins": "Combine roast, vinegar, olive oil, salt, peppercorns, savory, mint, rosemary, and thyme in a resealable plastic bag. Coat roast with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate roast in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nMelt butter in an oven-safe pot over medium heat. Transfer roast to hot butter, reserving marinade in bag. Cook roast until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Place roast on a work surface.\nPour marinade into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add broth and simmer until sauce is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Return roast to pot and cover.\nCook roast in the oven until meat falls apart when poked with a fork or knife, 6 to 8 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve meat with reduced sauce.",
