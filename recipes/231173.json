    "des": "\"This is a recipe I developed after tweaking many other recipes. It has become a real favorite in my household! Easily adjustable to your preference of spiciness as well. Also easy to change to your liking by adding other veggies or peppers. Save time by cooking extra chicken ahead of time when making other chicken dishes. Serve with your choice of toppings, like sour cream, guacamole, sliced avocados, sliced black olives, or whatever else you like!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBring chicken breasts and water to a boil in a large skillet; cook over medium heat until chicken juices run clear and meat is no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken breasts to a large plate, reserving pan juices in skillet, and shred chicken with 2 forks.\nCook onion and red bell pepper in reserved drippings over medium heat until onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Return shredded chicken to skillet. Stir black beans, corn, picante sauce, chopped green chiles, chili powder, and cumin into chicken mixture until thoroughly combined. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken mixture into prepared baking dish.\nArrange flour tortillas in a single layer over chicken mixture. Stir fiesta soup with diced tomatoes and green chiles in a bowl until thoroughly combined; spread soup mixture over tortillas. Top casserole with Mexican cheese blend.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese topping has melted and casserole is hot, about 30 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.",
