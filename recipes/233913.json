    "des": "\"I was looking for an easy turkey salad recipe to go with the ingredients I had on hand, but couldn't find one I liked. So quite naturally, I came up with my own. These have just a touch of spice to them. I found them both, easy and good.\"",
    "ins": "Mix turkey, salad dressing, tomatoes with green chile peppers, jalapeno peppers, onion, chili powder, and black pepper together in a bowl until turkey salad is evenly combined.\nStack tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a paper towel. Microwave until tortillas are warmed, 20 to 30 seconds.\nSpread about 2 tablespoons turkey salad onto 1 side of each tortilla; top with Mexican cheese blend and lettuce. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling in a burrito-style.",
