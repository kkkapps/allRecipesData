    "des": "\"This is a quick and tasty sweet and sour dish. I like to marinate the tofu in the same sauce used on the dish, and then bake it at 375 degrees for 20 minutes--it makes the tofu really take on the flavor of the sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the tofu and stir-fry until golden brown. Remove the tofu and set aside, leaving the remaining oil in the wok.\nStir the ginger and curry paste into the hot oil for a few seconds until the curry paste is fragrant and the ginger begins to turn golden. Add the zucchini and bell pepper; cook and stir for 1 minute. Pour in the lime juice, soy sauce, maple syrup, coconut milk, and tofu. Bring the coconut milk to a simmer, and cook a few minutes until the vegetables are tender and the tofu is hot. Stir in the chopped basil just before serving.",
