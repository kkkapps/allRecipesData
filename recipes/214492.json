Place the chicken breasts onto the spinach mixture; top with the rest of the mixture. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese. Return to the oven and bake until the cheese has begun to melt and brown, about 15 minutes.",
