    "des": "\"Fall spices and a hint of chipotle combined with the sweetness of butternut squash and pears come together with Swanson\u00c2\u00ae Chicken Broth to create a warming puree.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nPlace squash in a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Spread the squash in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper.\nRoast squash in prepared oven for 20 minutes; turn. Continue roasting until softened, 10 to 20 minutes more.\nPlace the chopped bacon into a heavy pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve the bacon drippings.\nPlace the pot over medium heat; add the onion, pears, garlic, rosemary, and thyme and cook in the bacon drippings until onions and pears are soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the roasted squash and cook another 5 minutes. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth, nutmeg, cinnamon, and chipotle pepper; simmer on medium-low until ingredients are very soft and flavors have combined, about 10 minutes.\nPuree the soup in a blender or food processor in small batches.\nLadle soup into serving bowls and garnish with crumbled bacon and a generous dollop of sour cream. Enjoy!",
