    "des": "\"This recipe is from my mother-in-law and it's the only way to get my husband to eat bananas and my kids to eat zucchini. I make them into muffins because they get eaten faster than the bread. But it's great either way.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 36 muffin cups or line with paper liners.\nMix bananas, white sugar, zucchini, applesauce, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a sifter and sift into the banana mixture; add oats and mix until batter is just combined. Fill muffin cups with batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool muffins completely in the tin before removing.",
