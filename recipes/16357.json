Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil and add spinach and salt and pepper to taste. Saute spinach for 5 to 7 minutes or until wilted and no longer watery. Remove spinach from skillet and toss with pasta; transfer and keep warm.\nIn the same skillet, heat 2 more tablespoons of oil and add scallops and 2 cloves of sliced garlic. Cook scallops for 1 to 2 minutes or until they appear opaque. Add scallops and garlic to fettuccine and spinach mix; transfer and keep warm.\nIn the same skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add 2 more cloves of sliced garlic and saute until golden. Add mushrooms, soup and white wine to skillet. Stir over medium heat for 8 minutes or until warm.
