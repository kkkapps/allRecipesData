    "ins": "Pass each matzo sheet under cool running water briefly, then crumble into a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup milk, eggs, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla extract to form evenly moistened batter. Add more milk if batter is too dry.\nHeat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Scoop a generous spoonful of dough onto skillet and flatten with a spatula. Cook until golden brown on each side, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.",
