    "des": "\"This baked omelette is quick, easy and a great summer dish. Scamorza cheese is an Italian cheese similar to mozzarella, that's harder and has more flavor. You can use mozzarella or a semi-hard cheese instead. This omelette would go well with a side dish like cherry tomato and anchovy salad.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a round baking dish with olive oil and line with parchment paper.\nBeat eggs in a bowl until frothy; add milk, basil, rosemary, mint, thyme, salt, and pepper and mix well. Mix honey and lemon zest into Greek yogurt. Stir yogurt mixture and Scamorza cheese into eggs. Pour egg mixture into the prepared baking dish and top with Parmesan cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until set in the center, about 15 minutes.",
