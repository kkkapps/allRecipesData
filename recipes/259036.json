    "des": "\"This is an all-time favorite dish in my husband's family. At every occasion it's there...from the first taste to the last, I love it. The more pineapple you add, the tastier the dish! It will taste slightly salty and sweet.\"",
    "ins": "Place duck on a work surface. Coat skin with salt and fill the cavity with lemon grass. Transfer duck to a pot and cover with water. Add onions and garlic; boil until meat is tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nLet duck cool, 15 to 20 minutes. Carve.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Deep-fry the duck meat until crispy and brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Fry the potatoes until golden brown, about 5 minutes.\nLayer the duck, pineapple juice, soda, evaporated milk, potatoes, and pineapple chunks, in this particular order, in a large saucepan. Simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Season with salt.",
