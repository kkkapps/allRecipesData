    "des": "\"This sweet treat can be eaten as a dessert or served with dinner. Absolutely addictive. Best if served warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.\"",
    "ins": "Place the sweet potatoes in a saucepan, and stir in 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. Cook and stir over medium heat until most of the juice has evaporated. Stir in the marshmallows just until partly melted. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.\nOnce the sweet potato mixture is cool, stir in the confectioners' sugar and flour. Add more sugar to taste if desired.\nCut each tortilla in half, and spread a thin layer of butter on each side. Place 1 tablespoon of the sweet potato filling onto the center of each one running parallel to the cut edge, then fold in the sides, and roll up from the straight edge to seal in the filling.\nHeat about 1 inch oil in a large heavy skillet to about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chimichangas until light golden brown, turning as needed. Remove to paper towels to drain. The tortillas will darken a little after they are removed. Mix together the remaining cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle over the chimichangas while warm.",
