    "des": "\"This makes a great condiment at holiday brunches. I made this for a Mother's Day get-together to serve with toast and french toast, and the mothers in my life enjoyed it enough to ask for it as a Christmas present. Serve with toast, rolls, biscuits, etc. Yummy on pancakes, waffles, and croissants!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F/165 degrees C.\nSpread the pecans onto a baking sheet; toast in the preheated oven until they start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, about 15 minutes. Watch carefully as they bake, they burn quickly. Set aside to cool to room temperature.\nPulse the brown sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a food processor several times to thoroughly combine. Butter will be slightly fluffy. Sprinkle in the cooled nuts and pulse several times to combine. For more finely ground pecans, pulse several more times. Serve immediately, or pack into a jar with a lid and refrigerate.",
