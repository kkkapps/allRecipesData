    "des": "\"The lamb in this dish is succulent and extremely tasty. Lamb is roasted to perfection with flageolet beans. Serve with rosemary potatoes, if desired. This dish makes a wonderful alternative to the classic Sunday lunch or Christmas dinner.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nPlace leg of lamb in a large baking dish. Prick in 6 places with a sharp knife; insert garlic cloves into the slits. Brush butter over lamb. Season with salt and pepper.\nRoast in the preheated oven, basting regularly with juices, for 25 minutes. Arrange cannellini beans around the lamb, mixing to coat with juices. Continue roasting until beans are warmed through and the internal temperature of the lamb reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) for medium, about 15 minutes more.\nLet lamb rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve beans on the side.",
