    "des": "\"Tart, firm apples bake to juicy tenderness under a delicious topping, which is a cross between cake and biscuit. This goes really nicely with a custard sauce such as Bird's Custard\u00c2\u00ae.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir apples, 2/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together; distribute apple mixture into a 9x9-inch baking dish that is at least 2 inches deep.\nWhisk flour, remaining 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir egg, cream and melted butter together in a cup; pour egg mixture into flour mixture and stir until all ingredients are moistened. Using the back of a spoon, spread batter over apple mixture to seal apples in completely.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 50 minutes.",
