    "des": "\"I made this and even my picky eater ate it!  The aroma that settles in the house is amazing!  You can add other vegetables to it, but I couldn't due to the fact that my child would not eat it if he saw something strange in it.\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, stir together the flour, black pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dredge the pieces of beef in the seasoned flour, and brown the beef on all sides in the hot oil.\nMix together the water, vegetable broth, beef broth, Cabernet wine, thyme, bay leaves, onion, and garlic in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot. Add the beef, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook the stew until beef is very tender and liquid has reduced, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the carrots and potatoes, bring back to a boil, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 more minutes.\nMix the cornstarch in a small bowl with a little water until smooth, and stir into the stew. Simmer until thickened, stirring constantly. Adjust salt and pepper before serving.",
