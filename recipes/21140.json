    "des": "\"I got this recipe from a friend and it is awesome!  When I want comfort food, this is the one that I turn to.  My husband loves it too! We love the stuffing so much I usually double the recipe for the bread crumb mixture, leave everything else the same.  For the bread cubes, French bread works best, not sourdough.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a skillet, heat the oil and brown the pork chops.  Place the pork chops in a baking dish.\nIn a bowl, toss the bread cubes, melted butter, chicken broth, celery, onion, and poultry seasoning together. Put heaping mounds of the bread crumb mixture onto the pork chops.\nCombine the cream of mushroom soup with the water, and pour this mixture over the stuffing and pork chops.\nCover and bake for 30 minutes.\nUncover and continue baking for 10 minutes longer or until juices run clear. The meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
