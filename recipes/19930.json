    "des": "\"I had this dish at a wedding banquet and it was very good. The sweet lychee nicely compliments the apples and shrimp.  I have also tried this dish with potatoes instead of apples, it's not as sweet, or try it with both. Great for light summer dinner, or as a surprising potluck dish.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine lychees, shrimp and apples. Stir in lemon juice and 1/4 cup reserved lychee juice. Let chill for 15 minutes.\nRemove from refrigerator and drain liquid. Combine drained liquid with mayonnaise and toss together with fruit. Chill for at least another hour and serve cold.",
