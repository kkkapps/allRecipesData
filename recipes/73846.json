    "des": "\"A spicy choice for snack food when you need to crunch on something.  Great to put out at a party or have next to you at your computer. If you really love wasabi, you may wish to double or triple the coating mixture.\"",
    "ins": "Soak the dried peas overnight, then rinse and drain. Place peas in a large pot with enough water to cover by a couple of inches. Add the Mirepoix, and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Coat a large cookie sheet with olive oil. It helps to use a cookie sheet with sides to keep them from rolling off.\nDrain the peas, and transfer to the cookie sheet. Roll them around in the oil by tilting the pan, or stir with your hand. Bake for 4 to 8 hours in the preheated oven, stirring every 30 minutes or so, until peas are dry. Remove from oven, and season with salt, onion salt, and garlic powder.\nWhile the peas are roasting, mix together the wasabi powder, tahini, rice vinegar, and Dijon mustard in a large bowl. When the peas are ready, pour them into the bowl, and stir to coat with the wasabi mixture. Pour them back onto the cookie sheet in a single layer, and return to the oven.\nBake for another 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the aroma becomes very strong, and the coating is dry.",
