    "des": "\"I don't usually like 'baking' with the microwave, but this recipe works great. The topping comes out crispy on top, moist inside, and delicious all around. It's a wonderful dessert that's quick and easy to make. Best served warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.\"",
    "ins": "Spread the apples evenly in an 8 inch square glass baking dish. A deep dish glass pie plate will also work. In a medium bowl, mix together the melted butter, brown sugar, oats, flour, cinnamon and allspice. Sprinkle this topping evenly over the apples.\nCook on full power in the microwave for 10 to 12 minutes, until apples can easily be pierced with a knife. Enjoy!",
