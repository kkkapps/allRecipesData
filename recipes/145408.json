Here is the next best thing to one of hers! If you can't find the frozen mixer, 1/2 can coconut cream and enough pineapple juice to create a simulated 'can's worth' will work.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the pina colada mix, pineapple with juice, vanilla ice cream, rum, and ice in a blender. Blend until slushy.\nPour the whipping cream into a bowl, and beat until soft peaks form. Stir into the pina colada mixture to blend evenly; pour into four glasses. Top each drink with a cherry.",
