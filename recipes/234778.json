    "ins": "For the crust: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.\nMix veggies and hash browns together. Gently press between paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible. In a large nine inch pie plate, toss the veggie mixture with the melted butter. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons of the cheese packet from the box of Steakhouse Hash Browns over hash brown mixture and blend. Using the bottom of a measuring cup, press mixture into the bottom and up the sides to firmly form a crust. Place rack on the lower third of the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and the edges begin to crisp. While crust bakes, make the filling.\nFor the filling: Blend the eggs and cream until smooth. Stir in the artichokes, leeks, ham, cheese and seasonings.\nWhen the hash brown crust is ready, lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and pour the filling into the crust. Bake for 30 minutes then sprinkle the crunchy onion topping on the quiche. Continue to bake for another 15 minutes or until the quiche is light golden brown and firm in the middle. Quiche will settle as it cools.",
