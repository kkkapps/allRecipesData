    "des": "\"These are perfect, bite-size mushroom appetizers that are always a hit at parties and family gatherings alike. Even the little ones love them - just don't tell them they're made with mushrooms! The recipe comes from a French-Canadian grandmother whose kitchen creations are magnifique.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nChop green onions and mushrooms very finely, to a nearly paste-like consistency.\nMelt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir in green onions and mushrooms and cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk cornstarch into half-and-half; pour into mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Season mushroom mixture with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.\nRoll bread slices with a rolling pin until very flat and thin. Spread mushroom mixture evenly onto flattened bread; tightly roll up bread slices. Slice each bread tube into 1-inch thick rounds; place rounds onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until bread is browned, about 10 minutes.",
