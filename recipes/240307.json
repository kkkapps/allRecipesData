Layer pineapple over cream cheese mixture layer.\nBeat milk and pudding mixes together in a bowl until thickened and creamy; fold in bananas and spread over pineapple. Layer strawberries over pudding mixture; top with remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 hours.\nDrizzle chocolate syrup over whipped topping layer and arrange the cherries equally apart from each other so each piece gets 1 cherry.",
