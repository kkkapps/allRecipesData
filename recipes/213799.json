    "ins": "Season pork with the rosemary, thyme, pepper, and salt.  Heat oil in a large large Dutch over over medium-high heat. Sear pork in the hot oil until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.\nStir onion and carrot into pot; cook until onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nPour in the wine; stir, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits from the bottom.  Stir in the tomatoes and stock. Bring to a simmer; cook until meat is very tender and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.",
