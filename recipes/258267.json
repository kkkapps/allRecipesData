    "des": "\"This seafood risotto is a classic Italian dish served on many occasions, from the simplest to the most elegant. For best results, use homemade seafood stock, though store-bought can be used in a pinch.\"",
    "ins": "Soak mussels, clams, and shrimp in separate bowls of salted cold water for 1 hour. Drain. Clean and devein shrimp, reserving heads and shells.\nCombine shrimp heads and shells, 2 quarts water, tomato, quartered onion, carrot, and celery in a large pot; bring to a boil.

Keep warm over low heat.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chopped onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.

Repeat with remaining stock, stirring after each addition, until rice is creamy and almost tender, about 15 minutes.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 clove garlic and cook until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add mussels and 1/2 cup white wine; cover and cook until mussels open, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; discard garlic and any mussels that did not open. Remove shells and keep mussels warm.
