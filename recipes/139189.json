    "des": "\"These are deliciously soft moist sugar cookies with the creamy richness of Bailey's Irish Cream! Wonderful as a St. Patrick's day treat or for any day you're craving a sugar cookie. I brought these to a party and within minutes, they disappeared. Feel free to omit the Bailey's and just cut down the flour by about half a cup.\"",
    "ins": "Cream together butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in vanilla and egg yolk until combined, then beat in egg; beat until smooth. Pour in Irish cream, and beat until incorporated.\nSift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Stir into butter mixture until evenly mixed. Form into a flattened ball, wrap well with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
