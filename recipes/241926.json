    "des": "\"Every time I make this someone wants the recipe. It is great if you have overnight guests. Make it ahead and enjoy the morning with them. Check for doneness by inserting a knife in casserole. If it comes out clean you are ready to serve. This is a great brunch recipe served with biscuits, sweet rolls, and fresh fruit.\"",
