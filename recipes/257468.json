    "des": "\"Traditional Italian ditalini pasta and chickpeas made even better and faster by adding Barilla\u00c2\u00ae Tomato and Basil sauce, cooked quinoa, and shrimp for a savory meal.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. If all water has not been absorbed, drain.\nHeat oil in a large pot. Add carrots, celery, and onion; cook and stir until vegetables soften and onions begin to turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chickpeas with liquid and cooked quinoa. Stir in jalapeno pepper. Add tomato sauce, salt, and nutritional yeast; stir to combine.\nSlowly pour in 2 cups boiling water; add ditalini. Continue to stir; add more water only if needed. Cook until ditalini are al dente, 9 to 10 minutes. Mixture should have a stew-like consistency. Add shrimp; cook and stir until shrimp are heated through, 1 more minute.\nDivide among serving bowls; top with fresh, chopped parsley and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.",
