    "des": "\"I was forced to create these when my favorite brand stopped making their lamb meatballs, which were a staple in my little food-obsessed world. They're even more scrumptious with a small side of plain yogurt with some mint and cumin stirred into it. Add rice or couscous and a green salad and you have a tasty, easy, somewhat elegant dinner! This recipe can also be used to make meatballs for frying, if you prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the grill for high heat.\nIn a bowl, mix the lamb, green onions, garlic, curry powder, cumin, red pepper, salt and pepper. Form into 4 patties.\nLightly oil grill grate. Grill patties 5 minutes on each side, or until done.",
