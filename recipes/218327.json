    "des": "\"I watched my mom make these when I was a kid. I loved them then and I love them now, and you will too. Goes great with mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and a salad. I like to cook them on a medium-high heat, about 350 degrees, so that the peppers cook soft. You can adjust your temperature to lower the cook time. Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix the ground beef, mixed vegetables, 1 can of tomato sauce, rice, onion, green onions, garlic, egg, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Spoon the beef mixture into the bell peppers. Arrange peppers in a baking dish, and spoon the remaining 1 can of tomato sauce on top. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the beef is no longer pink, about 1 1/2 hours.",
