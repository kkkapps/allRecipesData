    "des": "\"A wonderful casserole of root vegetables, apple, and cheese served to me by my mom during my last visit. I took the basic recipe and added a few touches of my own. Try different types of cheese for the topping.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBring a large steamer pot of water to a boil. Place fennel, celery root, and onion slices in the steamer insert. Steam until tender, approximately 7 to 10 minutes.\nSpread the steamed vegetables and apple slices evenly in the bottom of an 8 x 8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour cream around the sides of the dish until the liquid reaches half-way to the top. Sprinkle with shredded cheese, and cover tightly with foil.\nBake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly and cheese has melted, approximately 40 minutes.",
