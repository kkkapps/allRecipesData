    "des": "\"This is a creamy, rich soup that is pureed to be really thick. It will keep you warm on those cold days. Try it with some fresh Italian or French bread, or garnish with croutons.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over high heat, combine the potatoes, onions and water to cover and boil for 30 to 45 minutes, or until tender. Drain the mixture, reserving 3 cups of the water. Transfer this in small batches to a blender and puree until smooth.\nIn the same pot over medium heat, combine the flour and the butter, stirring together well, to form a roux. Slowly add the milk, stirring constantly, until well blended. Reduce heat to low and add the pureed potato mixture. Let simmer, stirring occasionally for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.",
