    "ins": "Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 tablespoon of sugar. Combine 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon butter, 1 tablespoon powdered milk, and 2 cups all purpose flour. Stir in beaten egg and proofed yeast water. Mix and knead for 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed.\nTransfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.\nMelt 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Stir in red pepper.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.\nTransfer dough to a floured work surface. Pat it into a rectangle; allow dough to rest, covered with greased plastic wrap, for about 10 minutes. Roll dough into a larger rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Evenly spread onions on dough; roll up from the short end to form a log. With a sharp knife, slice into pinwheels.\nPlace rolls on prepared baking sheet; let rise a second time, about 30 minutes. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.",
