    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nRoast whole yams in preheated oven until heated through but not quite tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool.\nReduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMelt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir brown sugar, orange juice, and nutmeg with the melted butter to dissolve the sugar completely; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook until the liquid thickens into a syrup, 10 to 15 minutes.\nPeel cooled yams. Cut yams into bite-size chunks; arrange in a single layer in a 13x9-inch baking dish. Drizzle syrup over the yams.\nBake in the preheated oven, twice opening the oven to spoon syrup over the yams, until the chunks are fork-tender, about 35 minutes. Arrange marshmallows over the yams and continue baking until the marshmallows are puffy and browned, about 10 minutes more.",
