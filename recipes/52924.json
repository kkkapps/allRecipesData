    "des": "\"A fairly quick and simple recipe that utilizes store bought sauce and polenta to save time for busy folks.  This casserole is VERY rich, so use small servings.  Feel free to add more ingredients to the simmering sauce to suit your own tastes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 8x8-inch casserole dish with cooking spray and set aside.\nHeat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in green pepper, garlic, and green onions; cook until the pepper softens, about 3 minutes. Pour in marinara sauce and simmer 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nMix together fontina and provolone in a bowl. Spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 1/3 of the polenta slices in the dish, top with 1/3 the fontina and provolone mixture. Spread a thin layer of sauce over cheese. Repeat layers twice. Top casserole with Parmesan cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 25 minutes.",
