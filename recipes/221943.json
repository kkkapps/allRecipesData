    "des": "\"This dip was a successful trial. I had extras of odd things and they tasted really good together! Rinsing the artichoke hearts removes most of the brine. I prefer that because I do not like very salty foods. You can skip this step if you'd like it saltier. Put as many of the ingredients in a food processor as you can and let 'er rip! You really can not mess it up.\"",
