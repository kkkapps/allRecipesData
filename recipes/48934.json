    "des": "\"The red wine vinegar and cilantro make this brisket really something special.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it and always asks for more!  It is really important to let this marinate for a full day -- it makes all the difference.\"",
    "ins": "Trim the excess fat from the brisket. Poke a lot of holes all over brisket with a skewer. Briskets are usually long, so cut meat in half so that it will fit into a large, resealable bag with the marinade.\nIn a blender, combine garlic, cilantro, and vinegar. Blend until smooth. Pour marinade into resealable bag with the meat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.\nPreheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nShake flour into largest-size oven cooking bag. Place brisket into bag. Close bag and pierce as instructed on package. Layer the onions on top of the brisket, inside of the bag. Place on baking pan in the center of the oven.\nBake in preheated oven until tender, about 6 hours. Slice thinly across the grain to serve.",
