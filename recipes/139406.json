    "des": "\"When I was a child, I could never enjoy the fried or smothered liver that Mom made because I didn't like liver.  As an adult, wishing to please a liver-loving friend, I found this recipe and was amazed to really like it myself.  I searched the web for this recipe to no avail and finally found it in my collection.  It's so good, I had to share.  Mushrooms, onion, Monterey Jack cheese, sherry, and herbs add a wonderful balance.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and mushrooms; cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon; set aside.\nIn the same skillet, cook liver over medium heat until brown on both sides.  Add sherry, rosemary, basil, and sauteed onion and mushrooms. Top each liver piece with a strip of cheese.\nCover and simmer 10 minutes.",
