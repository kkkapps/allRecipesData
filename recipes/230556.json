    "des": "\"These are a year-round favorite in our house. We've made several variations and still come back to this one as our all-time favorite. Hand-shelled pecans from Grandma's tree, with a vanilla-orange sugar coating that gets its depth from cinnamon, pepper, rosemary, and a bit of Kahlua\u00c2\u00ae and Grand Marnier\u00c2\u00ae.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Heavily butter a large metal baking sheet.\nBeat egg whites and water together in the bowl of a stand mixer until stiff peaks form. Add orange extract and vanilla extract; beat until incorporated, 1 minute.\nMix sugar, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl; fold sugar mixture into egg white mixture until just incorporated. Fold in rosemary and tangerine zest until evenly mixed. Add pecans to the sugar-egg white mixture; toss to coat. Spread coated pecans in one layer onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven, turning the baking sheet and stirring the pecans with a metal spoon every 8 to 10 minutes, until crispy and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to a sheet of parchment paper to cool completely.",
