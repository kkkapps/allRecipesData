    "des": "\"This is great on pork tenderloin or ribs. If you wish, the chicken can be partially cooked in the microwave. Serve with a green salad or baked potato, if desired. This is also good at room temperature, but you will ned lots of napkins! Sweet and savory, but not too spicy for kids.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl combine the preserves, salad dressing and soup mix; stir together until well mixed and set aside. Place chicken pieces skin side down in two lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dishes.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1/2 hour.\nBrush the skin side of the chicken pieces with the glaze mixture (you will use about 1/2 of the mixture) and return to oven; reduce temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) and bake for another 1/2 hour. Brush with remaining glaze mixture just before serving.",
