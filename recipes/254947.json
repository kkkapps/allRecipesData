    "des": "\"Sushi rice can be used for so many things. Sushi, of course, but also as a side dish for grilled meat or as a wrap using seaweed. Plus, it's perfectly fine at room temperature, so it's great for picnics.\"",
    "ins": "Place rice in a strainer and rinse under cold water until run-off turns from cloudy to completely clear, about 2 minutes. Place strainer over a bowl and let drain until almost dry, about 1 hour. Transfer to a heavy bottom saucepan with a tight-fitting lid.\nPour water over rice. Place pot over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer without stirring. As soon as little bubbles appear on the surface and rice starts to simmer, reduce heat to low and cover pan. Cook for exactly 10 minutes. Remove from heat; lift lid for 1 second and cover again immediately. Let sit another 10 minutes.\nTransfer rice to a rimmed sheet pan and spread out with a fork, fanning (with a magazine or similar object) to start to cool it. Sprinkle about half the rice vinegar on the rice while gently tossing it. Continue fanning to bring rice to just over room temperature. Sprinkle the rest of rice vinegar over the rice and toss with fork to blend evenly. A small amount of rice should be easily formed into an oblong sushi base, but easily crumble when cut with a fork.",
