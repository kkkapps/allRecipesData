    "ins": "Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal mix, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat the egg together with the buttermilk. Gradually add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a fork or whisk until only slightly lumpy. Be careful not to overmix.\nCarefully drop batter by the rounded teaspoonful into hot oil, and fry until golden brown. Drain and cool on a paper towel-lined plate. Roll balls in a small amount of cinnamon mixed with sugar, if desired, or just enjoy plain!",
