Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nForm bean mixture into 12 patties and arrange onto a non-stick baking sheet.\nBake burgers in preheated oven for 10 minutes, turn, and continue baking until cooked through, about 10 minutes more.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat. Cook burgers in hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.",
