Line a muffin tin with liners.\nMix gluten-free flour, protein powder, baking soda, cacao powder, and salt in a large bowl.\nPlace mashed bananas, turbinado sugar, melted butter, and egg in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment; beat on medium speed until well-blended and airy. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is evenly moistened. Stir in chocolate chips and sliced almonds.\nScoop the batter into the muffin tin, filling each liner 2/3 of the way full.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Let muffins cool on wire rack before serving, about 10 minutes.",
