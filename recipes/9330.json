    "ins": "Melt the shortening in a large pan on the stove, and cool.\nAdd sugar, eggs, and molasses, beat well.\nIn a separate bowl, sift dry ingredients together and add to the pan. Mix well and chill 3 hours or overnight.\nForm into walnut-size balls. Roll in granulated sugar. Place on greased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8-10 minutes.\nStore in an airtight container to keep from getting overly crisp. If they do lose their softness, an easy way to restore it is to place one slice of fresh bread in the container with the cookies for a couple of hours or overnight and they will be soft again!",
