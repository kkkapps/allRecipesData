    "des": "\"My boss brought this soup to the office one fine day and I was hooked on it from the first taste.  It is a snap to make and the flavors are mild, yet very distinct.  My kids loved it the first time I made it at home and it instantly became known as 'Tim Perry's Soup.' You might like a stronger curry flavour or a creamier soup, so adjust the seasonings to your taste.  It's ready within the hour, but the longer it simmers the better the flavor. Serve with crusty bread and butter.\"",
    "ins": "In a stockpot, combine chicken broth, onion, cauliflower, and broccoli.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low.  Continue to simmer until vegetables are tender.  Season with curry powder, chicken bouillon, salt, and pepper.\nIn a bowl, combine flour and 1/2 cup of the milk.  Whisk briskly until there are no lumps.  Add mixture to soup, stirring continuously as soup thickens.  Stir in Cheddar cheese until completely melted.",
