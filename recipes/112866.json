    "des": "\"We love spicy foods and never tire of this quick supper. Keep the grill hot and it's almost foolproof! This dish comes together in the time it takes to toss a salad, pour the wine and ring the dinner bell.  Roughly torn pieces of rustic country style bread heated on the grill make a nice accompaniment.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat a grill to medium heat.\nBrush steaks on both sides with olive oil, then sprinkle with a mix of cracked pepper and celery seed.  Cook steaks to desired doneness on the preheated grill.  When done, allow steaks to rest on a plate while continuing with the recipe.\nBring the Bloody Mary mix, orange juice concentrate, and vodka to a boil over high heat; then reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes.  While sauce is cooking, puree the olives, butter, and garlic in a small food processor until almost smooth.\nTo serve, pour a pool of the sauce in the center of each plate. Slice each steak into 4 or 5 slices, and fan out over the sauce.  Add a dollop of olive butter, and spoon a little more sauce overtop.",
