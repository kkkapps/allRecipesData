Stir pumpkin mixture into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Refrigerate batter for flavors to blend, 20 to 40 minutes.\nScoop about 1/4 cup batter into each doughnut well.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a doughnut comes out clean, 9 to 13 minutes. Cool doughnut completely in pan. Loosen edges of each doughnut with a small offset spatula or knife and transfer to wire rack.\nWhisk confectioners' sugar and 3 tablespoons maple syrup together in a small bowl until glaze is smooth.\nPress doughnuts facedown into glaze to cover the top completely. Place doughnuts on a wire rack for glaze to set, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle pumpkin seeds over glaze.",
