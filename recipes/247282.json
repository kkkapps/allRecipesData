    "des": "\"It attacks your taste buds! Spicy chorizo-style sausage and lean ground turkey combine to make a kick-butt burger that's full of taste but won't leave you feeling stuffed. This burger could also be grilled outdoors for a smokier flavor. Goes great with a michel ada or frozen margarita.\"",
    "ins": "Combine ground turkey, chorizo, garlic, onion powder, chipotle flakes, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix with your hands until well-blended. Shape into 4 loosely-packed patties.\nHeat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat until hot; grease with buttery spread. Place patties on the griddle; cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Flip patties and cook until browned on the second side, about 6 minutes.\nTop each patty with a slice of pepperjack cheese. Cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute more.\nToast hamburger buns in a toaster oven. Spread 1 1/2 teaspoon mayonnaise over each half. Place cooked patties over bottom buns. Top each patty with 1/2 cup spring mix lettuce. Sprinkle lime juice over lettuce. Cover with top buns.",
