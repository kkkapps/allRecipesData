    "des": "\"This tomato-cornbread salad -- a riff on panzella, the Italian peasant classic designed to revive stale bread -- relies on ripe, juicy tomatoes to moisten and flavor the dry bread. After salting the tomatoes, give them a little time to release their juices.\"",
    "ins": "Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 250 degrees.\nPlace cornbread cubes on a cookie sheet with a rim; bake until bread is dried out, about 30 minutes, then set aside to cool.\nSalt the tomatoes, stir in the garlic and let stand until juicy, about 30 minutes.\nPrepare remaining ingredients; toss with tomatoes. Add bread; toss. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.",
