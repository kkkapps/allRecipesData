    "des": "\"Nothing beats a mug of hot cider on a cold winter day. This recipe is great as it calls for fresh apple cider and pure maple syrup.  Start with only 6 strips each of the orange and lemon peel, and adjust to taste.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the apple cider and maple syrup into a large stainless steel saucepan.\nPlace the cinnamon sticks, cloves, allspice berries, orange peel and lemon peel in the center of a washed square of cheesecloth; fold up the sides of the cheesecloth to enclose the bundle, then tie it up with a length of kitchen string. Drop the spice bundle into the cider mixture.\nPlace the saucepan over moderate heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the cider is very hot but not boiling.\nRemove the cider from the heat. Discard the spice bundle. Ladle the cider into big cups or mugs, adding a fresh cinnamon stick to each serving if desired.",
