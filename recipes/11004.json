Place half of the rounds on an ungreased baking sheet.\nCombine dates, white sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring often until thickened. Stir in walnuts. Remove from heat and let cool, about 10 minutes.\nSpoon 1 teaspoon of the date mixture into the center of each round on the baking sheet. Cut a cross in the middle of the remaining rounds. Place over date mixture; press down on the edges of the dough to seal.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.",
