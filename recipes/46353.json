Stir in olive oil and asparagus, and cook until the asparagus is tender, about 10 minutes.

Cover, and cook 5 minutes.\nTransfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until eggs are no longer runny. Top the mixture with Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese. Turn on the broiler, and broil until cheeses are melted and lightly browned.",
