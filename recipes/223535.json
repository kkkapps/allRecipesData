    "des": "\"Delicious and inexpensive, this is a breeze to whip up. You will love this sunny salad packed with seasonal tomatoes, basil, and garlic. An awesome take-along salad for work with some whole-grain pita wedges or a whole-grain bun, or a nice side for grilled chicken, pork, or fish! I heat the salad dressing (before adding the chopped garlic) in the microwave 30 seconds to ensure the honey incorporates.\"",

Stir garlic, red wine vinegar, cider vinegar, olive oil, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt with the honey to make a dressing; pour over the chickpea salad and toss to coat.\nCover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate salad for 1 hour before serving.",
