    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Add beef and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer the beef to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to keep warm. Reserve the oil in the skillet.\nReduce heat to medium, then stir in the onion and garlic, and cook until transparent, about 5 minutes. Toss in the mushrooms, red peppers, and yellow peppers and cook until tender, another 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and paprika; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Combine the beef with the tomato mixture and stir.\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add gnocchi and cook until they float, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, then toss the gnocchi in the sauce and serve.",
