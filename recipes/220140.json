    "ins": "Mash 3 cups sliced strawberries with 1 cup sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring strawberry mixture to a boil, stirring frequently.\nMix cornstarch with water in a small bowl and pour into mashed strawberries; reduce heat to medium-low.\nLet strawberry mixture simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Set aside.\nBring half-and-half to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat.\nBeat egg and egg yolk with an electric mixer in a bowl until frothy; gradually mix in 3/4 cup of sugar, then beat until the egg mixture is thick, pale yellow, and forms a ribbon when beater is lifted out of the bowl, about 3 minutes.\nMix in flour until smooth.\nGradually pour hot half-and-half into the egg mixture in a steady stream, beating constantly.\nReturn mixture to the saucepan and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the custard thickens and starts to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking, stirring constantly until flour is cooked, 2 to 3 more minutes.\nRemove custard from heat, and stir in butter and vanilla extract.\nSpread custard in an even layer over the bottom of graham cracker crust. Top the custard with the cooked strawberry mixture. Arrange fresh strawberries over the top.\nChill at least 3 hours before serving.",
