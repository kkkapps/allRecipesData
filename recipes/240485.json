    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhip Cheddar cheese and softened butter together in a large bowl using an electric hand mixer until smooth. Beat 1/2 cup flour into the cheese mixture at a time, assuring each addition is incorporated fully before adding the next. Add cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, and hot pepper sauce; beat to incorporate.\nUse a wooden spoon to fold the cereal into the cheese mixture; shape into 1-inch balls and arrange onto a baking sheet. Use the back of a spoon to flatten the balls slightly.\nBake in preheated oven until set but not yet browning, 15 to 17 minutes. Let crackers cool on pans for 1 minute before transferring to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.",
