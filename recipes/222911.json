    "ins": "Heat a small skillet over medium heat; toast chipotle pepper in the skillet, occasionally shaking the skillet, until pepper is fragrant and pliable, 3 to 5 minutes.\nUse scissors to cut pepper and remove stem and seeds and transfer pepper in a small bowl. Pour boiling water over pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow pepper to rehydrate and soften, about 5 minutes. Drain and mince pepper; set aside. Place the pineapple concentrate, olive oil, lime zest and juice, and minced garlic in a separate bowl.\nToast the cumin seeds over medium heat for a minute or two in the same skillet used for the chipotle pepper. Add cumin and reserved minced chipotle pepper to pineapple olive oil mixture; stir to combine.\nCombine the pineapple chunks, green cabbage, and red cabbage, cilantro, and red bell pepper in a bowl. Add the dressing mix and toss thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving, stirring occasionally.",
