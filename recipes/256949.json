    "ins": "Spray a jelly roll pan with cooking spray.\nCut pizza dough in half and roll each half into an 1/8-inch-thick rectangle. Arrange ham in 1 layer on each rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border. Layer salami, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, white Cheddar cheese, and bell pepper rings, in that order, over the ham.\nRoll dough around the toppings, starting with the long side. Stop halfway to tuck in ends; continue rolling. Place each stromboli on the prepared jelly roll pan.\nWhisk egg yolks and water together in a bowl; brush over stromboli. Cut diagonal slashes 3 inches apart in the top of each stromboli.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Allow stromboli to proof in a warm place while the oven heats up.\nBake stromboli until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack before slicing.",
