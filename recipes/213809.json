    "des": "\"This is a slightly different take on the traditional Thai steamed pumpkin cake. You simply need to grate the pumpkin, mix all the ingredients together, place in a pan, and steam. You can cool the cake and cut it into squares to serve at a later time - it is the perfect snack!\"",
    "ins": "Bring about 1-1/2 inches of water to boil in a steamer fitted with a basket large enough for a 9-inch square baking dish to lie flat.\nSift the tapioca flour, rice flour, and arrowroot powder together into a bowl. Gradually stir the coconut cream into the mixture until completely incorporated and smooth, about 10 minutes. Stir the sugar, pumpkin, coconut milk, and salt into the mixture, dissolving the sugar completely into the batter; pour into a 9-inch square baking dish.\nSteam over the boiling water until the cake is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Allow the cake to cool before cutting into squares to serve.",
