    "des": "\"This casserole has been served at our Easter Sunday brunch for over 30 years. It's easy to adjust the spiciness to suit your family's taste. My family likes it spicy, so we even have a bottle of hot sauce on the side for an additional kick! We serve this with a fancy fruit salad and all the Easter fixings for a delicious brunch buffet! Serve with additional sour cream, if desired\"",
