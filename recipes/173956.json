    "ins": "Cut the pheasant breast into 36 pieces, and place into a bowl. Pour the liquid from the jalapeno peppers over the pheasant, stir, and set aside to marinate for 20 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nDrain the marinade from the pheasant and discard. Place a slice of jalapeno pepper onto each piece of pheasant breast, and wrap with a third of a strip of bacon. Skewer 6 of the pheasant pieces on each skewer.\nCook on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until the bacon is crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the skewers from the pheasant pieces, and place a toothpick into each piece to serve.",
