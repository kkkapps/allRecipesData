    "des": "\"This vegetarian pizza is simple but mouth-wateringly delicious. Any combination of cheese can be substituted, but I recommend using either goat cheese or feta as one of the cheeses. You can use any crust, but I suggests a thin crust.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nUnroll pizza dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten into desired thickness.\nBake crust in the preheated oven until slightly cooked, 5 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant and sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt and black pepper.\nBrush pizza crust with leftover oil and garlic from skillet. Distribute onion, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and provolone cheese onto pizza crust. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence.\nBake pizza in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.",
