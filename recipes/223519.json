    "des": "\"These muffins are some of the best I've ever tasted. The lavender gives the flavor a slightly fresher taste, bringing out the vibrancy of the blueberries. You've got to try it! Serve warm with soft butter, if desired.\"",

Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.\nCombine all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, lavender, and salt together in a bowl. Mix bananas, milk, canola oil, and egg together in a separate bowl. Add banana mixture to flour mixture; stir until just combined. Fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into prepared muffin tin.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
