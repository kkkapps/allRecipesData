    "des": "\"This rub is my personal recipe, settled on after lots of experimenting. It's great on ribs, brisket, and pork butt. Quick and easy from ingredients everyone usually has. This recipe makes enough for 2 to 3 full racks of baby back ribs, depending on how liberally you coat them. For those that are new to barbecuing/smoking, 'rub' is a misnomer, as you're really just coating the meat and not actually rubbing it in. Generally, I'll rinse and pat dry the meat I'm prepping then apply a thin coat of yellow mustard so that the rub sticks.\"",
