Pour hot water out of pot and run cold water over eggs until completely cool. Peel eggs and cut in half lengthwise.\nSeparate the yolks from the whites of each egg. Mash the yolks in a bowl. Add mayonnaise, pickle relish, sugar, yellow mustard, vinegar, salt, and pepper to egg yolks and mix until smooth. Spoon yolk mixture into the egg whites and sprinkle paprika over yolk filling. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.",
