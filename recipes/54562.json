In line, ahead of me, was a man who said he has been a bartender for twenty years now, and that the recipe needed a few touch-ups if I wanted to make it like the Pros.

Chill the bottle of red wine, lemon-lime soda, and orange juice at the same time.\nGently crush the fruits with a spoon, then stir in the red wine, lemon-lime soda, and orange juice.  Add additional brandy or orange juice to taste.",
