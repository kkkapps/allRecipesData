    "des": "\"I have been making jangjorim for many years but recently decided to make it into a recipe to pass it on to my daughter. I have had my young Korean friends try it, and they told me that it tasted just like how their mothers made it! It is a Korean side dish, banchan, but it's so good you can just eat this and rice for a quick yummy meal anytime. jangjorim can be served cold right from the fridge, at room temperature, or can be heated up in the microwave. Add fresh ginger, if you like ginger.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large pot with water and add beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until meat can be punctured with a fork, about 30 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, white sugar, garlic, and ground black pepper; cook and stir until flavors combine, about 15 minutes.\nStir shishito peppers and eggs into the beef mixture. Cook and stir until meat can easily be pulled apart with a fork and liquids have been reduced to a third of the original amount, about 15 minutes.",
