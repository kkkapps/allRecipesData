    "des": "\"From legendary baker Dorie Greenspan's book, Dorie's Cookies (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2016), this savory cookie is perfect for parties, partnering up with soup or munching with a glass of wine. They're easy to make and the dough can be frozen, so it's ready to bake any time.\"",
    "ins": "Combine butter, Gouda cheese, Cheddar cheese, sea salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; pulse until butter is in bits and the mixture forms small curds. Add flour; pulse until dough looks moist and forms large popcorn-sized curds.\nTurn dough out onto a flat surface; knead gently just until it comes together and you can shape it into a ball. Divide into 2 pieces. Pat each piece into a disk.\nPlace 1 disk between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Roll to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Repeat with second disk. Stack sheets of dough on a baking sheet. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\nPeel parchment paper off 1 sheet of frozen dough. Cut into cookies using a 1 1/2-inch-diameter cutter; arrange 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the second sheet of dough.\nBake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly golden on the bottom, about 9 minutes. Rotate baking sheet. Continue baking until bottoms are golden brown and tops are lightly golden, about 5 minutes more. Cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes.\nGather dough scraps, roll to a thickness of 1/4-inch, and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Cut into cookies and bake.",
