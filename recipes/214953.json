    "des": "\"This frozen yogurt is so much easier than homemade ice cream! Just so you know, this freezes a lot quicker than ice cream. Also, if you want tart frozen yogurt, feel free to decrease the sugar!\"",
    "ins": "Stir the yogurt, sugar, and vanilla extract together until the sugar has dissolved. Cover. Refrigerate 1 hour.\nPour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches \"soft-serve\" consistency. Transfer to a one- or two-quart plastic container with a lid; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, frozen yogurt should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
