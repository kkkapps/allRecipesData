    "des": "\"This is one of my favorite recipes handed down from my mom.  The best thing is there are lots of vegetables and flavors, and it's usually a welcome change from standard  American versions.  The olives are the best part!  To save time, I usually chop all the vegetables and make the dressing while the potatoes are boiling.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool, then cut into 1-inch cubes.\nCombine the potatoes, cucumber, celery, onion, and olives in a large bowl.\nWhisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Pour the dressing over the potatoes and vegetables; mix well. Season with salt and pepper, then chill. Stir the potato salad again before serving.",
