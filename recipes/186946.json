    "des": "\"A fresh tasting, thick and chunky, habanero salsa that tangos on the tongue before igniting a nuclear fusion in your throat. This recipe is delectable as is, but can also be easily adjusted in both heat and flavor to suit personal tastes. Use additional peppers to taste if you dare!\"",
    "ins": "Place the stewed tomatoes, garlic, minced habanero pepper, minced jalapeno pepper, minced serrano pepper, and half of the diced onion into a food processor. Process until the mixture has been pureed.\nPeel the carrot, then use the vegetable peeler to cut the carrot into thin shavings. Roughly chop the shaved carrot along with the cilantro leaves. Place the carrot, cilantro, diced canned tomatoes, chopped fresh tomato, green onions, lime juice, vinegar, salt, and black pepper into the food processor. Pulse until the salsa reaches your desired consistency.\nFor best results, pour into jars and let sit in refrigerator for 2 to 3 days, but feel free to indulge immediately.",
