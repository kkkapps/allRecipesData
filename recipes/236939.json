    "des": "\"A little twist on your basic salmon recipe. It's healthy, delicious, and a real crowd pleaser! Make extra because everyone will want seconds! This recipe goes great over couscous. If you are like me and love tomatoes, add 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook salmon in the hot oil until cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate saucepan over medium heat; add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour balsamic vinegar into tomato mixture; add basil.
