    "des": "\"I've always liked this recipe because it is quick and easy. I'm always looking for ways to cut out excess fat so I use reduced-fat cheese and sour cream. I also like to add fiber to make the meal a little healthier for my family so I add black beans and some bell peppers. This also adds color! To make it super healthy I use whole-wheat flour tortillas. And it still tastes just as delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCook chicken in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain excess fat. Cube chicken and return to skillet. Add onion, sour cream, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, parsley, oregano, and ground black pepper.  Heat until cheese melts, about 3 minutes.  Stir in salt, tomato sauce, water, chili powder, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, garlic, and black beans.\nRoll even amounts of mixture into tortillas. Arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with taco sauce and 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese.\nBake uncovered in preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.",
