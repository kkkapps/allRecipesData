    "des": "\"This is a wonderful, easy to make warm potato salad we regularly serve at barbecues.  We have yet to meet someone who doesn't enjoy it.  You can use either Cheddar or mozzarella cheese in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter or grease one 8x16 inch baking dish.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Add onions, mushrooms, salt and pepper. Cook until onions and mushrooms are soft.\nSlice potatoes and place a thin layer in the baking dish. Follow with a layer of the bacon mixture and repeat layers until all ingredients are used. Pour cream and milk over layers; sprinkle with grated cheese.\nBake for approximately 35 minutes, or until cream and milk have almost reduced completely.",
