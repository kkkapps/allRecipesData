    "des": "\"This is a smooth soup, and can be changed by using different broth in the recipe for a different taste sensation. You can make this vegetarian by using vegetable broth or stock instead of the beef or chicken broth. If you do that, then I recommend using buttermilk in place of the cream.\"",
    "ins": "Place 1 tablespoon oil and 2 tablespoons broth in a large, non-stick pot over medium heat. Add the onions, leeks and marjoram and saute for 15 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.\nAdd the potatoes and 7 cups broth, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 25 minutes. Add the heavy cream, ground black pepper and cardamom. Puree the soup in small batches in a blender or food processor.\nPlace the mushrooms and the remaining 1 tablespoon of broth in a large skillet over medium heat and saute until the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms are golden in color. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the mushrooms, precooked carrots and precooked potatoes to the pureed soup. Stir together and serve.",
