Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.\nArrange half the potatoes in the prepared baking dish; top with half the bacon, sour cream, mozzarella cheese, Cheddar cheese, salt, and black pepper. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients.\nBake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes.",
