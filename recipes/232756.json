    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nPlace roast in a large baking pan; arrange potatoes, onion, carrots, and celery around roast. Pour 3 cups water into baking pan. Season roast with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Cover pan with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until roast is browned and cooked through, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Transfer roast to an oven-safe platter. Remove vegetables using a slotted spoon and arrange around roast.\nReduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place platter with roast and vegetables in the oven to keep warm.\nPour the remaining juices from the baking pan into a saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir 1/2 cup water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; pour into boiling pan juices. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring constantly,  until gravy is thick, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Stir in browning sauce.",
