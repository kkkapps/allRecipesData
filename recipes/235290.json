    "des": "\"A delicious winter squash soup with a sweet heat taste. Brown sugar gives the sweetness and poblano and jalapeno peppers give the heat. This soup can be made with butternut, acorn, carnival, or delicata squash; it just needs to be a hard winter squash. This will get warmer from the peppers the longer it sits. If you like your soup a little thinner add water or additional chicken broth.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace squash, cut-side down, in a baking pan and add 1-inch of water. Cover pan with aluminum foil.\nBake squash in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Cool until able to handle, about 15 minutes. Scoop flesh into a bowl and discard squash skin.\nMelt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, celery, poblano pepper, and jalapeno pepper in hot butter until softened but not browned, about 15 minutes.\nStir chicken broth, cooked squash, and salt into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.\nBlend soup with an immersion blender or in batches in a blender until smooth. Stir brown sugar into soup; simmer for 10 minutes. Adjust brown sugar to taste.",
