    "des": "\"Butter tarts are a British staple. These English ones have been in my family long enough that we don't know the origin. \nThey're fantastic with a sweet, homemade crust, but are my favourite treat to whip up quickly when I have shells pre-made. A fantastic winter or Christmas treat, they're delicious with warm cider.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until edge of crust is golden, about 10 minutes.\nLower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position a rack in the upper 1/3 of the oven.\nWhisk brown sugar, golden syrup, butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until smooth. Fill pastry shells with sugar mixture about 2/3-full.\nBake in the preheated oven until filling foams and is bubbly and golden, about 15 minutes. Remove pan and cool for a few minutes on a wire rack; serve warm or at room temperature.",
