    "ins": "In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, clams, green onions, water chestnuts, paprika and ground black pepper. Place about 1 teaspoon of filling into the won ton skin and seal corner to corner forming a triangle.\nIn a large skillet, heat oil to a high temperature. Fry the won tons until they are browned on both sides. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.",
