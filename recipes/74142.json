    "ins": "Heat corn oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until a pinch of flour sizzles in it.\nIn a shallow dish, stir together the flour, garlic salt, pepper, and cayenne. Dredge pork chops in this mixture, then place in the hot oil. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the pan, and drain on paper towels.\nPour the hot sauce into a shallow dish. Dip pork chops one at a time into the hot sauce, so they are nicely coated. You will have teary-eyed pork chops at your fingertips.",
