    "des": "\"This basic mango bread uses milk powder instead of eggs. You can even use any leftover baby formula powder in its place. This bread is delicious when served hot out of the oven, but can be kept for 2 to 3 days.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan.\nPlace the mango, water, sugar, milk powder, yogurt, and oil in a blender. Blend until smooth, then pour into a bowl. Sift together the wheat flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl.  Fold the flour mixture into the mango puree. Pour resulting mixture into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 30 to 45 minutes.",
