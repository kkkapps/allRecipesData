    "des": "\"This recipe is great for grouper fillets, but you can also use it with tilapia. It's both healthy and flavorful! You don't have to love fish to love this dish. Serve it with rice and cole slaw to complete the meal.\"",
    "ins": "Arrange the grouper on a plate. Drizzle the lime juice over the fillets and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or 8 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.\nLay the fillets in the prepared baking dish in a single layer. Arrange the tomato slices, onion slices, and bell pepper slices atop the fillets. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven until the fish flakes easily, about 1 hour.",
