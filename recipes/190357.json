    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix the sugar, coconut, and butter in a bowl. Stir in the egg yolks and the egg white; beat until well combined. Pour the mixture into a 9 inch pie plate. Place the pie plate in a large roasting pan. Pour enough boiling water into the bottom of the roasting pan to reach about half-way up the side of the pie plate.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely before turning out onto a serving dish. Refrigerate until serving.",
