    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Thoroughly grease a 10 x 4 inch tube pan.\nMix sugar and cinnamon.  Cut biscuits in quarters, then roll each piece in sugar-cinnamon mixture.  Arrange about 1/4 of the biscuit pieces and blueberries in an even layer in pan.\nPlace blueberries between biscuit pieces, creating a mosaic effect.  Repeat three times with remaining biscuits and blueberries, covering blueberries of one layer with biscuits in next layer to avoid a column of blueberries.\nIn saucepan combine sugar, margarine, vanilla, cinnamon, and the additional cup of blueberries.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat.  Cook, stirring frequently until sugar is dissolved and margarine is melted.  Pour over biscuits in pan.\nBake for 65 minutes or until done.  Lift or turn out onto a cake plate.",
