    "des": "\"The Greek yogurt gives the same tang as sour cream and the low-fat cream cheese adds thickness. My family didn't know the difference. Just made sure your yogurt is plain and not strawberry like I almost got. Serve over noodles or rice.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms and onions in hot butter until soft and caramelized, about 5 minutes.\nPour 1/2 cup chicken stock into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.\nGradually stir flour into mushroom mixture; cook and stir until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add remaining chicken stock to mushroom mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.\nStir yogurt into sauce; add cream cheese and stir until cheese melts and sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken into sauce and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes more.",
