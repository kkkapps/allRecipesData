    "des": "\"This dish is made from baby goat meat, and I love it as much in summer as in winter. This is because it is a soothing dish with an almost stew-like consistency while maintaining some spiciness in the flavor. It is a perfect comfort food that mom made for us when either we were sick and had lost appetite or feeling low due to a bad weather or something. It goes well with rice or chapatti.\"",
    "ins": "Season goat meat with salt and 1 teaspoon turmeric. Sprinkle salt over potato halves.\nHeat oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat; add 1/2 teaspoon sugar and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Place potatoes in the caramelized sugar and cook until potatoes are golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer potatoes to a plate.\nCombine cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon stick in the pressure cooker. Add onions, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir until softened and golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix tomatoes, remaining turmeric powder, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; cook for 5 minutes. Season mixture with salt. Add goat meat; cook and stir until goat meat is coated with spice mixture and browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour enough water over mixture to cover goat meat.
