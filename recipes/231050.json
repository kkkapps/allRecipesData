    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.\nWhisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and brown sugar in a bowl. Beat vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture to make a batter; gently fold apple and cranberries into batter. Pour into prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until muffins are lightly browned on top and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes.",
