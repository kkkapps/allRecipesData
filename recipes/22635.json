    "ins": "In a medium bowl beat together the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of sugar.  Using a wooden spoon stir in mascarpone cheese, beaten egg whites, cream and kirschwasser; stir until smooth.  Set aside.\nDissolve remaining 2/3 cup sugar in coffee.  Quickly, to avoid complete saturation, dip ends of ladyfingers in coffee mixture.  Place ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish.  Spread a layer of cheese mixture over the ladyfingers; repeat layers, ending with cheese mixture.\nCover and refrigerate for several hours.  Sprinkle with cocoa just before serving.",
