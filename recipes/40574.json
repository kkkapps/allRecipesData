    "des": "\"I searched for a long time to find a teriyaki marinade with a flavor as good as what you find in some restaurants, with the right amount of sweet and salty. Finally I made up my own recipe where the flavor increases the longer you marinate. Also works well with pork chops or beef steaks.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix the pineapple juice, vegetable oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, and pepper. Place chicken in the bowl, and coat with the mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven broiler.\nPlace chicken on a baking sheet. Broil 5 minutes on each side in the preheated oven, or until no longer pink and juices run clear. Discard remaining marinade.",
