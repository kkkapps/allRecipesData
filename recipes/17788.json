    "ins": "Blanch the tomatoes in a pot of boiling water for about 15 seconds, or until the skins just begin to peel. Immediately remove them from the hot water and plunge them in ice water to stop them from cooking. Peel, core and dice the tomatoes into 1/2 inch pieces.\nIn a large pot, combine the oil and vinegar and whisk together well. Pour in the tomato juice, garlic, salt and ground black pepper and whisk well again.\nStir in the tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and almonds and combine all the ingredients together thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate overnight.",
