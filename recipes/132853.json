    "des": "\"A friend of mine makes a similar Southwestern-style soup using sweet potatoes, but I found that processing the potatoes takes a bit of extra work.  I came up with the idea to use canned pumpkin and created this wonderful, thick, hearty soup that doesn't take a lot of effort to make. It's full of all that's good for you, so enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the garlic and cumin and cook, stirring, for an additional 2 minutes.\nPour in the pumpkin puree, black beans, corn, chicken broth, tomato sauce, and 1 teaspoon cilantro; season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a gentle boil; reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes.\nGarnish each bowl of soup with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream and additional cilantro, if desired.",
