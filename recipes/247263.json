    "des": "\"Here's buttery fried chicken using a new method.  B\u00c3\u00a9chamel sauce binds chopped cooked chicken to form patties (croquettes). They are then fried to a crisp golden brown and served with a savory garlic butter sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large heavy saucepan over low heat. Add onion and cook until tender. Stir in flour; cook and stir until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce heat if mixture browns too quickly.\nGradually add 1/2 cup of chicken broth and cook over medium heat stirring constantly until thickened and bubbly. Stir in dry mustard, salt, and chopped chicken; whisk in egg yolks.\nCook over medium heat stirring constantly for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours or preferably overnight.\nCombine remaining 1/4 cup chicken broth and hot pepper paste; stir into chilled chicken mixture.\nShape chicken mixture into patties (an ice cream scoop will give you consistent size patties). Dredge patties in cracker crumbs.\nPour 1/2 inch oil into skillet. Heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, fry the croquettes until golden brown; do not turn the croquettes until they are well browned on the first side, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and cook the other side, 4 to 5 minutes. Fry in batches, as needed. Drain on paper towels.\nMelt 1/3 cup butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, stirring constantly to prevent it from burning. Stir in flour and whisk continuously for 1 minute.\nPour in the milk and herbs and continue to cook, whisking constantly, until sauce begins to thicken, about 1 minute.
