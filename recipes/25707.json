    "des": "\"This is a great soup that just gets better overnight, and is a family favorite.  Cook time can be shortened by using a pressure cooker to cook the beans.  Canned beans just do not give the best flavor, so I would not recommend them.  Each person adds the amount of sour cream to their bowl that suits their own taste.  It is wonderful served with a crusty bread.\"",
    "ins": "Wash and pick through beans.  Place them in a large pot with the water.  Season with salt and pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until just tender.\nStir in undrained corn and tomatoes, potatoes and cabbage.  Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.  At the table, stir sour cream to taste into individual servings.",
