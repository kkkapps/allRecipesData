    "des": "\"In the South, okra is every where. I threw together this recipe when trying to come up with something different. When I make this for the kids, I leave out the tomatoes and onion.\"",
    "ins": "Combine okra, tomato, and onion in a large bowl. Add the grits, eggs, salt, and pepper and blend together using your hands.\nHeat oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Form patties 2 1/2 inches in diameter, about 1/2 the size of a hamburger.  Place the fritter in the pan and cook until golden brown, about five minutes.  Flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side, about five minutes more. Remove and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.",
