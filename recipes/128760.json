    "des": "\"I made this for my wife she is an avid Mexican restaurant visitor. The amount of spice you want in this recipe depends on the RO*TEL\u00c2\u00ae and the salsa. I recommend if you do not like it hot get the mild RO*TEL\u00c2\u00ae and a medium salsa.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine the eggs, tomatoes, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl.  Gently stir the ground beef and crackers into the egg mixture.  Press into a 8x8 inch square baking pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes.\nRemove the loaf from the oven, and drain any liquid from the pan.  Spread a layer of salsa on top of the loaf, and sprinkle with shredded cheese.  Return the loaf to the oven; bake until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.",
