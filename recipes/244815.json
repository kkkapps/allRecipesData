    "ins": "Place turkey bacon in a skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Cook to desired crispness, turning occasionally, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool slightly. Chop bacon into small pieces.\nMix Swanson(R) Chicken Stock, cream, lemon juice, minced garlic, and dill in a microwaveable bowl. Microwave on HIGH for 1 minute, 30 seconds.\nPlace water in the bottom of a double boiler; water should not touch the bottom of the top pan. Bring water to a boil. Lightly beat egg yolks in the top of the double boiler. Cook, stirring until thickened and egg yolks are about double in volume, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.\nGradually whisk in stock/cream mixture, whisking until completely combined. Mix thoroughly for another minute. Season with 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Remove from heat and cover to keep sauce warm.\nSet a steamer basket insert into a large saucepan. Pour in Swanson(R) Chicken Broth to just below the bottom of the steamer; bring to a boil. Add green beans, season with 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and steam until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Discard leftover chicken broth or reserve for another use.\nTransfer beans to a serving dish; sprinkle with bacon crumbles. Top with hollandaise sauce and serve.",
