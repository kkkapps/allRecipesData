Fold in almonds.\nRoll dough 1/8 inch thick on lightly floured board; cut out small rounds with 2 inch cookie cutter.  Place 1 inch  apart on a greased baking sheet.  Put 1 teaspoon Almond Meringue in center of each round to make it look like the crown of a hat.\nBake 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. To Make Icing:  Gradually add water to 2  cups confectioner's sugar, mixing until icing is stiff.  Add 1 to 2 drops of food coloring.
