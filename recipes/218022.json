    "des": "\"All of the southern women in my book club love to eat.  Each month we choose a potluck theme. The theme this month was 'Soul Food Throw Down.'  Our dessert this month was blackberry cobbler.  This is an easy recipe that uses canned blackberries.  It's best with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut the shortening into 2 cups of self-rising flour in a bowl with a pastry cutter until the shortening forms small pieces the size of peas. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, just until the dough holds together and is workable. Divide the dough into 2 balls. On a well-floured surface, roll out a dough ball into a piece about 9 inches square and 1/4 inch thick. Lay the dough into the bottom of a 9x9-inch baking dish.\nIn the same bowl you used to mix the dough, pour the blackberries with their juice, 3/4 cup of sugar, and 1/3 cup of self-rising flour. Mix until the sugar has dissolved, and pour the filling over the crust. Roll out the remaining dough ball into a square about 9 inches square, and cut the dough into strips. Lay the strips over the filling. Cut the butter into thin slices, and lay the slices over the strips of dough. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of sugar.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.",
