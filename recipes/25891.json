    "des": "\"An unbelievable rich twist on au gratin potatoes, this casserole develops a caramelized, cheesy, roasted-garlic crust as it bakes. However, this dish does not save well (leftovers tend to separate and become oily), so eat up!  Wonderful with a ham dinner.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn the prepared dish layer 1/2 of the potatoes, 1/2 of the cheese, then the remaining potatoes.\nMelt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.  Saute garlic until fragrant and golden brown; pour over potatoes.\nCombine cream, salt and pepper; pour evenly over potatoes and sprinkle with remaining cheese.\nBake in preheated oven for 75 minutes.  Serve immediately.",
