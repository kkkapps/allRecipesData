    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nCombine ground venison and ground beef in a bowl. Divide into 4 balls, and flatten into patties.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat. Place the burgers in the heated skillet and sprinkle each burger with salt, black pepper, a dash of beer, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Flip the burgers once a brown crust has formed on the bottom, about 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle the cooked side of the burgers with the salt, pepper, beer, and Worcestershire. Cook burgers another 5 to 10 minutes for well done. Top each patty with bacon and serve on hamburger buns.",
