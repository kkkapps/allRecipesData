    "des": "\"This recipe was handed down from my great grandmother. It took a few years to figure out the exact measures. These cookies are very soft and if you want to use a cutter, the dough should be refrigerated a couple hours. I use a three inch biscuit cutter. You can also drop these if you are short on time. Sprinkle tops with colored sugar or whatever decorative confection you like.  These are good plain also.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the lard and sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the buttermilk. The mixture will be very runny at this point. Combine the flour, baking soda, nutmeg and salt; stir into the buttermilk mixture by hand using a wooden spoon. Try not to over mix the dough or the cookies will be dense. Drop by spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets. For cut out cookies, the dough should be refrigerated for a couple of hours. Roll out to 1/2 inch thickness and flour your cookie cutter between each cut.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
