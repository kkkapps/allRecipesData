    "ins": "Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Wrap garlic in aluminum foil.\nBake garlic in the preheated oven until dark brown and softened, about 30 minutes. Remove garlic from the foil and let cool, about 7 minutes.\nReduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet.\nPeel garlic into a bowl; mash with butter to form a chunky paste. Mix in mayonnaise. Spread garlic butter over the bread slices; top with tomato and Parmesan cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the bread has absorbed the garlic butter, about 5 minutes.",
