    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a wire rack on top of the aluminum foil.\nPlace sauerkraut in a colander in the sink and press all the liquid out using the back of a large spoon. Flake sauerkraut into a large bowl and add sausage; mix well. Form sausage mixture into quarter-size balls and arrange on the rack on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cooked through and browned, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
