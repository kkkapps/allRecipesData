    "des": "\"This is a delicious filling that is put onto hamburger (or hot dog) rolls and baked in the oven.  Fantastic for a cold weekend day when the kids need a good lunch. This recipe came from my mother.  It has been one of my favorite recipes for over 30 years.\"",

Stir in tomato sauce, onion, black olives, pimentos, mushrooms, Cheddar cheese, chili powder, salt,  and black pepper.\nSpoon sandwich filling on hamburger bun bottoms, spreading to the edges. Filling should be approximately 1/2\" thick in the center of the sandwich.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges start to bubble, 5-10 minutes. Turn oven to Broil and continue to cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.",
