    "des": "\"These granola bars pack well for mid-day snacks or hiking trips. Vary the ingredients for variety or to make them more wholesome. I make two versions--this one if for my sweet-tooth husband--the other for myself, contains 1 c. dried fruit and nuts instead of chocolate chips and marshmallows. Be creative!\"",

In a separate bowl, stir together the oats, chocolate chips, mini marshmallows, cereal rings and wheat germ. Stir the dry ingredients into the peanut butter mixture until evenly coated. Press lightly into the prepared pan.\nBake or 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until slightly golden. Cool in the pan on a wire rack. Cut into bars.",
