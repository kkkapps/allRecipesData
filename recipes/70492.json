    "ins": "In a large pot, place the potatoes, celery and leaves, and onion. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Remove the celery leaves, and stir in the bouillon cubes until dissolved. Mix in the corn. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.\nMix the chives into the pot, and continue cooking 5 minutes before serving.",
