    "des": "\"Spinach, egg noodles and a creamy hot dog mixture is topped with peas and crumbled bacon. What a casserole! This is a recipe I received in German class 24 years ago. It looks unusual, but it is very delicious. I don't know where the teacher found the recipe. Drop biscuits go well with this casserole.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare spinach according to package directions. Drain and spread in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and place on top of spinach in baking dish.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl combine the soup, milk, sour cream and hot dogs. Mix together and place mixture on top of noodles.\nCover dish with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes, or until heated through. Sprinkle with peas and bacon and heat in oven until peas are just hot.",
