Cook without stirring for 5 minutes, or until the potatoes have begun to brown on the bottom.\nSprinkle potato slices with rosemary, thyme, oregano, parsley, and paprika. Turn the potatoes, and continue cooking 5 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat, and sprinkle the garlic and cayenne over the potatoes. Lightly toss for about 1 minute, until the garlic has softened.",
