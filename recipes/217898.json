    "des": "\"A spicy, flavorful, and moist turkey burger.  This is my husband's favorite.  It tastes delicious and I make it with extra lean ground turkey breast. The grated onion adds moisture as well as flavor to the turkey.\"",

Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.\nCook the patties in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning once, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C), about 6 minutes per side.
