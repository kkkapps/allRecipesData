    "des": "\"My family kept turning up their noses at my meatloaf. I tried several recipes in hopes of finding one that they would all like. They told it was just too darn plain for their taste. I tried adding oatmeal or rice instead of dry bread crumbs, adding different kinds of veggies, I used canned tomatoes, or ketchup, or tomato paste, or different styles of tomato sauce, even different spices until I came up with this one. When I saw all plates clean and being asked for more, I knew I had found the one they liked and the keeper for our family.\"",

Place mixture into a large loaf pan and shape into a loaf.\nBake in the preheated oven until meatloaf is no longer pink inside and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the middle of the loaf shows at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour.",
