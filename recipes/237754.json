    "des": "\"This is my take on an American-Mediterranean fusion. Well, we were also low in the protein area that night, so this was created. Considering the dish is a salad, it is still plenty filling and full of fresh flavors. The time spent making it is all in the prep work, then just simply assemble.\"",
    "ins": "Mix water and falafel mix together in a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes. Form mixture into 12 patties, about 1/2-inch thick.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nFry falafel patties, working in batches, in the hot oil until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked falafel to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon; season with salt. Cool falafel to room temperature; break into pieces.\nWhisk sour cream, milk, cucumber, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy; refrigerate.\nSpread greens onto serving plates. Arrange tomatoes, avocado, bacon, eggs, feta cheese, and falafel in rows over the greens. Drizzle dressing over each salad.",
