    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the egg, honey, molasses and vanilla until well blended. Combine the whole-wheat flour, dry milk, soy flour and wheat germ; stir into the molasses mixture until a smooth dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut in to finger length strips, and place onto an ungreased cookie sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Cool and store in an airtight container at room temperature.",
