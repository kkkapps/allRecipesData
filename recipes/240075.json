    "des": "\"This is a great savory pork roast that is excellent when paired with a sweet squash dish, greens, and Jasmine rice.  Pair with your favorite Chardonnay.\n\n Cut into 3/8-inch slices, serve over rice, and don't forget to pour drippings over the pork and rice. Absolutely delicious. You can use any white wine in place of the Chardonnay.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk salt, garlic powder, celery salt, ginger, mustard, black pepper, basil, oregano, and thyme together in a small bowl.\nCut 1/4-inch deep slits in the fat-side of the roast about 1 1/2-inches apart. Rub spice mixture all over prepared roast to cover completely. Place roast in a slow cooker, pour wine over the top and drizzle with honey.\nCook on High until tender, 3 to 4 hours.",
