    "des": "\"This recipe is similar to refried beans without the frying. These slow cooker beans will go well with any of your favorite Mexican dinners. For faster cooking, soak beans overnight.\"",
    "ins": "Place the beans, sugar, garlic, onion, and bacon into a slow cooker. Pour in the water, cover, and cook on High for 6 hours. Drain off 2/3 of the liquid, and discard bacon. Use a potato masher to mash beans to a chunky consistency. Season with salt to taste, and serve hot.",
