    "des": "\"There are two kinds of deviled eggs, sweet or savory; mine are the sweet variety. They always seem to be the first dish to disappear at any gathering I bring them to. My Grandma taught me this recipe forty years ago, and it's remained basically unchanged. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\"",
    "ins": "Place the eggs in a saucepan in a single layer with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel once cold.\nDry the eggs thoroughly with paper towels, and slice them in half lengthwise. Remove the yolks, and place in a bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork, and stir in the sugar, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and white pepper. Add the mustard, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and vinegar, one at a time, stirring to incorporate each ingredient before adding the next.\nMound a heaping teaspoonful of the yolk mixture into the cavity of each egg half, and sprinkle with paprika.",
