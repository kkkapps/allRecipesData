Cook and stir apple, onion, and celery in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with white pepper, salt, and a dash of cinnamon. Stir in almonds; cook until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.\nFold apple and almond mixture into rice. Let stand until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.",
