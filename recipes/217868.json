    "des": "\"My mom tried something similar to this in a restaurant and thoroughly raved about it, so I tried to re-create it for Mother's Day. She loved this version so much that she won't order Maple Curry Chicken in restaurants anymore! Serve over your favorite pasta.\"",

Cook and stir until the onion and peppers are soft.\nSprinkle sugar over onion mixture and cook one minute. Pour in maple syrup and cook another minute. Add curry paste and cook another minute. Pour in chicken broth and cream. Bring to a slow boil, then simmer on medium-low heat for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a separate pan, cook the chicken over medium heat until cooked through on all sides, about 10 minutes.
