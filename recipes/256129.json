Threw this chili together out of some leftover pork loin and cauliflower rice, and was thrilled with the result. The cauliflower is for texture only - it has little effect on the taste.\"",

Cook and stir cauliflower \"rice\" until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.\nCook and stir ground beef in the same pot until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
