Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and cool.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium baking dish, mix cranberries, sausage, bread cubes, dry bread crumbs, onion, and garlic. Season with parsley, oregano, sage, thyme, celery seed, ground ginger, salt, and pepper. Stir in chicken broth to desired consistency. Mix in walnuts and orange.\nBake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until surface is crisp and lightly browned.",
