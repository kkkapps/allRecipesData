Add the green chiles, chopped tomatoes, salsa verde and cook until it just comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Add the hominy and chicken broth and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for at least 10 minutes to allow flavors to develop. Season with salt and pepper. Add chicken and cook until heated through, 3 minutes.\nTo serve, divide among 4 bowls and garnish as desired.",
