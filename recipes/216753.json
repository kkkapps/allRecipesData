    "des": "\"This is a recipe that I have used for years. If you are concerned about too much oil you might want to try cutting back a little on the oil. I don't make waffles that much so I don't worry about it! Add couple drops of food coloring to the batter. Red and green food colors for the holidays. Orange for Halloween, pink and red for Valentine's Day, green for St. Patrick's Day, red and blue for Fourth of July, Memorial Day and Labor day! Optional, dust with confectioners powdered sugar. \"",
    "ins": "Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.\nWhisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar; set aside. Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl with the milk, vegetable oil, and food color. Stir the flour into the egg mixture until only slight lumps remain.\nPour batter into waffle iron in batches, and cook until crisp and golden brown. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar to serve.",
