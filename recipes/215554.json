    "des": "\"This is a deliciously light and fresh-tasting twist on cucumber tomato salad. It takes me to the water's edge, and begs to be served with fresh seafood. Substitute Greek kalamata olives for black olives if desired.\"",
    "ins": "In a large salad bowl, mix together the cucumbers, zucchini, red onion, tomatoes, black olives, basil, and thyme. In a separate bowl, whisk together the red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, lemon zest, lemon juice, kosher salt, sugar, and white pepper until thoroughly combined. Pour the olive oil slowly into the dressing mixture, whisking to combine. Pour the dressing over the salad, and serve.",
