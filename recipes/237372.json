    "des": "\"A quick whiskey chicken that has so many uses, whether by itself, over rice, or in pasta. A great dinner or lunch meal. Again it's best to BBQ the chicken, and you can remove the garlic cloves if desired; they are only there to leech flavor into the sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nSeason chicken thighs with salt and pepper.\nCook the chicken thighs until no longer pink in the center and somewhat charred on the outside, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nLet chicken cool until able to handle easily, cut into strips, and put into a large glass bowl.\nStir pineapple juice, bourbon whiskey, soy sauce, garlic cloves, brown sugar, and black pepper together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; stir until the sugar dissolves, bring to a simmer, and cook until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhile the sauce simmers, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms in hot butter until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir into the simmering sauce.\nPour the mushrooms and sauce over the chicken strips and toss to coat.",
