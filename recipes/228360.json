    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCombine peaches, tapioca, almond extract, and 1/4 cup brown sugar in a bowl. Set mixture aside until tapioca pearls have softened, about 15 minutes. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup of brown sugar and flour in a separate bowl.\nProcess rolled oats with walnuts in a food processor, pulsing a few times to grind to coarse crumbs; stir walnuts and oats into flour mixture. Drizzle topping mixture with melted butter and stir with a fork to create large crumbs of topping. Pour peaches and their juice into an 8x8-inch baking dish; spread crumb topping atop peaches in an even layer.\nBake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve slightly warm.",
