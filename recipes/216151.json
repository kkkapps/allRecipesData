    "des": "\"This is a favorite dish in my family, it's so easy to make and tastes great! My mom couldn't think of a good name for the casserole so she asked my brother and I for help coming up with the name. We named it 'Pig Slop' and as gross as the name sounds, it just works. You can call it Bean Casserole if the original name grosses you out! My mom would always serve this dish with cornbread, either on the side or she'd put the Pig Slop over the cornbread.\"",

Sprinkle in the chili powder and Cheddar cheese. Stir until evenly mixed, then pour into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the mixture is hot and the cheese has melted, 25 to 30 minutes.",
