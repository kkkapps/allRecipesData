    "des": "\"I lived above a Thai restaurant for a year in Sydney and they made the best green curry I've ever tasted. I was a regular customer and they even loaned me plates and bowls. I managed to persuade the chef to let me know how he made the curry. I've adapted it slightly to bring down the heat but it's still got a nice kick to it. Apparently the paste will keep in the fridge for up to 4 months! Serve immediately over fluffy jasmine rice.\"",
    "ins": "Place cumin, coriander, ginger, garlic, green chile peppers, lemon grass, cilantro, lime juice, lime zest, and 2 tablespoons of corn oil in a food processor. Blend to a smooth, thick paste. Set aside.\nHeat 1/4 cup of corn oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green beans and baby corn for about 30 seconds. Stir in the paste, soy sauce, and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, then add the shrimp. Cook the shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 3 to 5 minutes. If the sauce becomes too thick, stir in some water.",
