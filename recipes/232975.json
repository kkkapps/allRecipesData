    "des": "\"This is a fabulous appetizer; it does take a little time to prepare, but the taste is well worth it. If you want to freeze them for later use, they turn out just as good; just pop them in the freezer after filling the cups and then bake a bit longer then in the original recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLine each cup a mini-muffin pan with a wonton wrapper, carefully pressing each into the shape of a cup. Take care to not tear the wrapper as they will tear easily.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer 'cups' to a baking sheet; repeat until remaining wontons are all baked.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Set sausage aside to cool.\nStir cooled sausage, Colby cheese, green onions, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and ranch salad dressing together in a bowl; spoon into the wonton cups.\nBake in oven until cheese has melted and is beginning to bubble, 15 to 20 minutes.",
