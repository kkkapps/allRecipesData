    "des": "\"This is a very special Slovak Christmas soup made with sausage, ham and sauerkraut.  I have made it for many foreigners and they were always amazed.\"",
    "ins": "Place the sauerkraut, chicken broth, peppercorns, bay leaves, salt and mushrooms into a large pot, and bring to a boil. Add the sausage and whole piece of ham. Let it simmer over medium heat for 1 1/2 hours. Add the prunes after the first hour.\nRemove the meat from the soup, and set aside. Remove bay leaves, and discard.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and fry until clear. Sprinkle the flour and paprika over the onion; cook and stir for a minute. Gradually stir in the water with a fork so that no lumps form. Bring to a boil, and allow to thicken. Pour into the soup pot. Cube the sausage and ham, and stir into the soup. Bring to a boil, and cook for another 10 minutes.\nTo serve, ladle into bowls, and top with a dollop of sour cream.",
