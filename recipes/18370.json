    "des": "\"My husband and I fondly refer to this as 'Cheater Pot Pie.'  This is similar to a standard pot pie, but prepares much quicker. Use whole or two percent milk.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9 inch deep dish pie pan with melted butter; reserve some of the melted butter.\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, combine mixed vegetables and chicken; cook until vegetables are tender. Fold in soup; mix well. Pour in milk and mix until smooth; mixture should not be runny. Add salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil.\nRemove from heat and spread mixture into bottom of pie pan. Separate biscuits into layers and place gently on top of mixture. Drizzle remaining butter on top of biscuit layers.\nBake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.",
