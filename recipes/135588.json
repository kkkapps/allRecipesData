    "des": "\"This is a fantastic and simple salad.  Use as a first course or an appetizer with great success.  Pancetta is Italian bacon, you can substitute regular bacon if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Place asparagus in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes. Drain, cool in a bowl of ice water, drain on paper towels, and place on a serving platter.\nIn a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil or medium-low heat.  Add the garlic and cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the pancetta, and continue to cook and stir for 8 to 10 minutes, or until browned.\nRemove the pan from the heat and stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice and Dijon into the garlic-pancetta mixture.  Pour the sauce over the asparagus.",
