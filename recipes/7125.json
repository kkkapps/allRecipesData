Add 3/4 cup sugar, and mix thoroughly.  Add the cooled scalded milk mixture, and beat until foamy.  Mix in yeast mixture.  Add flour gradually, beating after each addition.  Beat until thick and springy.  Add flour only as needed to make a soft dough; too much will make hard doughnuts.    Cover, and let rise until doubled.\nShape dough into small balls.  Let rise on floured waxed paper until doubled\nIn a deep-fryer, heat shortening to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Fry until brown.  Roll in sugar.  Cool.",
