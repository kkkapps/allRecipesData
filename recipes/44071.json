    "des": "\"A great but easy recipe to use up extra ground venison, elk, moose or beef. It can be multiplied easily and freezes very well.  Serve on crackers with cheese and a great mustard sauce.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef and water until well blended. Season with garlic powder, curing mixture, liquid smoke and mustard seed, and mix thoroughly. It is best to use your hands for this - like meatloaf. Form the mixture into two rolls, and wrap with aluminum foil. Refrigerate for 24 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove foil from the beef, and poke holes in the bottom of the rolls. Place them on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan to catch the drippings.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Cool, then wrap in plastic or foil, and refrigerate until cold before slicing.",
