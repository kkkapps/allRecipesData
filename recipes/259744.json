    "des": "\"This soup is a great-tasting comfort food to take the chill off a cool fall or winter day. Roast the pumpkin on your grill or in the oven. Either way, using the pumpkin shells as bowls adds a fun touch. Sprinkle more nutmeg and pepper over soup before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Spray inside and outside of pumpkin with cooking spray.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nPlace pumpkin, pulp-side down, on the grate. Close the lid. Grill until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn over, skin-side down; grill until pulp is very soft and lightly charred, 20 to 30 minutes. Reduce heat as necessary to keep the grill temperature below 450 degrees F (232 degrees C). Let pumpkin cool on the grill.\nMelt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; saute until translucent and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable stock, cornstarch, and curry powder; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thick and foamy and cornstarch is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium.\nScoop pulp out of the pumpkin, reserving the hard shell to use as bowl. Add pulp to the stock mixture, breaking up any large lumps. Stir in milk, sour cream, soy sauce, and sugar. Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir in nutmeg, salt, and pepper.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring constantly, until just starting to boil, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Serve in the pumpkin shells.",
