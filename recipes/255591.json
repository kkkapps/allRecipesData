    "des": "\"In the best examples I've had of beef bulgogi in Korean restaurants, the meat, while tender, still had a little bit of chewiness to it.\u00c2\u00a0You can control texture by the thickness or thinness of the slices and how long you marinate them. But this is a fairly fast-acting marinade, so I go with an hour or two.\"",
    "ins": "Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and chile flakes.\nTransfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.\nSeason meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.\nBrush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.",
