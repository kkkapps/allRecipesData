    "des": "\"A New England style turkey with maple syrup. Try stuffing it with Cranberry, Sausage and Apple Stuffing. If you have fresh marjoram on hand, use 2 tablespoons rather than the 1/2 teaspoon dried. For an added zing of taste, two tablespoons of apple brandy can be added.  If you don't have fresh thyme, substitute 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.\"",
    "ins": "Boil apple cider and maple syrup in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/2 cup (about 20 minutes). Remove from heat and mix in 1/2 of the thyme and marjoram and all of the lemon zest. Add the butter or margarine and whisk until melted. Add salt and ground pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until cold (syrup can be made up to 2 days ahead).\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place oven rack in the lowest third of oven.\nWash and dry turkey. Place turkey in a large roasting pan. Slide hand under skin of the breast to loosen breast skin. Rub 1/2 cup of the maple butter mix under the skin of the breast. If planning on stuffing turkey do so now. Rub 1/4 cup of the maple butter mixture over the outside of the turkey. With kitchen string tie legs of turkey together loosely.\nArrange the chopped onion, chopped celery and chopped carrot around the turkey in the roasting pan. If desired the neck and giblets may be added to the vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining thyme and marjoram over the vegetables and pour the chicken stock into the pan.\nRoast turkey at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cover turkey loosely with foil (shiny side towards turkey). Continue to roast until very tender, basting occasionally with pan juices. About 3 to 4 hours unstuffed, 4 to 5 hours stuffed. Pierce the leg joint with a fork, if the juices run clear or faintly pink then the turkey is done. Transfer turkey to a platter and cove with foil. Reserve pan mixture for gravy.\nTo Make Gravy: Strain pan juices into a measuring cup. Spoon fat from juices. Add enough chicken stock to make 3 cups. Transfer liquid to a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil.\nMix 3 tablespoons of the reserved maple butter mixture with the flour in a small bowl to form a paste. Whisk baste into broth mixture. Add the chopped fresh thyme and bay leaf. Boil until reduced and thickened slightly, whisking occasionally. Add apple brandy if desired and season with salt and ground pepper to taste.",
