    "ins": "In a skillet, cook onion in oil over medium heat until soft. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, and cover; continue cooking until tomatoes are soft and begin to break down. Season with chili powder, tamarind extract, and salt.\nTransfer mixture to a blender or food processor.
