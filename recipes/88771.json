    "des": "\"This seven-layer salad takes some inspiration from the salads they sell at Boots (pasta shells and julienned carrots) and some inspiration from my grandmother (curry powder and brown sugar). This makes a really refreshing, flavorful salad that I simply love and that my friends request at barbeques!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water to cool.\nPlace the carrots in an even layer in the bottom of a large glass bowl, preferably one that is roughly the same diameter from top to bottom. Place the lettuce in a layer over the carrots. Combine the cucumber, peas and corn; spread in a layer over the lettuce. Once the pasta is cooled and drained, then spread that out over the top.\nIn a smaller bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, brown sugar, curry powder, and garlic salt. Spread this carefully over the pasta. Top with shredded Cheddar cheese. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.",
