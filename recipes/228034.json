    "des": "\"Rainy day, and my second attempt at risotto is a delectable success to my surprise. \nLittle bit of Irish, little bit of the Mediterranean, and a little bit of home makes for a great eat. This recipe is delicious vegan or non-vegan. It's a great base for additions too. Let your imagination run wild and comment back on your additions that you like.\"",
