    "des": "\"Thin strips of steak are marinated in a lime and chipotle chili sauce, breaded and then fried in oil.   I made this recipe to take the gamey flavor out of venison steaks, but it works great for any type of steaks or even for homemade chicken strips.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the lime juice, soy sauce, minced chipotle, and 1 tablespoon olive oil; stir in chile powder, paprika, cumin, and garlic. Toss venison strips until well coated with marinade, set aside, and marinate for 20 minutes.\nDrain venison strips in a colander, pressing out any excess liquid. Place the flour in a plastic bag, season to taste with seasoned salt and pepper. Toss venison strips with the flour until each piece is coated.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Shake excess flour from the venison strips, and cook until well browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.",
