    "des": "\"This is a delicious onion soup that uses red wine for liquid - but don't worry, despite its title you'll only be drunk on happiness! This is delicious served with garlic bread. The salt can be reduced, and the wine should have a 0 or 1 sugar code.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter or margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute for 10 minutes, or until onions become caramelized. Add the garlic, thyme, salt, brown sugar and 2 cups red wine.\nStir well, bring to a boil and continue to heat until soup has reduced by half. Add the remaining 2 cups red wine and the parsley. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.",
