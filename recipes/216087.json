    "des": "\"Even if you don't have a lot of time to spend getting dinner together, you can still charm your family with this clever meal idea. In less time than it takes the fusilli to cook, you can conjure up a spicy Alfredo sauce with blackened Smoked Sausage. When the pasta is done, just toss with the sauce. It's pure magic.\"",

Place in bowl and sprinkle with seasoning; toss lightly to evenly coat.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 minutes.  Add sausage; cook and stir for 3-4 minutes or until lightly browned.  Stir in Alfredo sauce, parsley and hot sauce to taste; heat through.\nPour over pasta and toss until well coated.
