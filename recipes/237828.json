    "des": "\"Homemade mayo is one of those indescribable culinary pleasures. If you have a stick-style or regular blender you can make your own mayo! It's so much cheaper and way more delicious. You also get to decide what kind of oil you want: a nice fruity olive oil; a lighter vegetable oil; or your own secret custom mix.\"",
    "ins": "Pour egg yolks, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, salt, sugar, vegetable oil, and olive oil, respectively, into a tall, narrow bowl. Set a immersion blender into the oil mixture and hold against the bottom of the bowl; pulse until a thick, pale mixture begins to form, about 3 to 6 pulses. Continue blending until smooth and creamy.",
