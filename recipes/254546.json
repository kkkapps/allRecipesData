Mix until evenly combined.\nDivide the meat into 8 equal portions. Using your fingertips, press the portions of meat into 1/4-inch patties.\nIn a small bowl, combine Salemville blue cheese and 1 tablespoon of the fig onion mixture. Divide mixture into 4 equal portions. Place a portion of the blue cheese mixture onto half of the patties, save the rest for topping. Add one of the remaining patties to the top of the patties with Salemville blue cheese, and pinch to seal.\nPlace the burgers on a prepared grill and cook for 7 minutes each side. Remove patties and let rest for 5 minutes. Place lettuce and tomato on bottom of each bun. Add patty and top with remaining fig onion jam.",
