    "des": "\"A delicious, cheesy pre-dinner treat. I like to make quesadillas without butter, but you could put butter in the frying pan before placing the tortilla in. Serve with sour cream and salsa.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large frying pan or griddle over a medium heat. Place one tortilla flat on the frying pan. After 1 minute flip the tortilla over. Sprinkle a little more than 1/4 cup cheese on the tortilla, followed by some olives, avocado, and hot pepper sauce. Place another tortilla on top to make a sandwich. Cover the quesadilla with a lid. After one minute, flip the quesadilla. When the cheese has melted on the inside, remove the quesadilla.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.\nCut the quesadillas into triangles and serve.",
