    "des": "\"A healthier way to make tostadas and better tasting. The simple secret to making crispy tostadas is baking the corn tortillas instead of frying.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nMix garlic salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and black pepper together in a small bowl.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Keep warm while preparing tostada shells.\nBrush oil over both sides of tortillas and arrange on a baking sheet.\nBake tortillas in preheated oven until crisped on top, about 5 minutes. Flip tortillas and continue baking until other side crisps, 2 to 3 minutes more.\nHeat refried beans in a saucepan over medium-low, stirring regularly until hot, about 5 minutes.\nDivide refried beans between tostadas and spread over one side of each; spoon ground beef mixture over the beans. Top each tostada with lettuce, Cheddar cheese, and diced tomato.",
