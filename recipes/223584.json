    "des": "\"I came up with this broccoli slaw side dish when I was trying to clear the fridge out prior to leaving for a vacation. Grabbed what I saw, stirred up a bowl, and gave it a cheeky title based on some of the cute terms my daughter uses for food. I used lite mayo and Splenda, and I'm sure it would be great with full-fat mayo and sugar. Saved the other half-can of garbanzos for tossing with a salad. I also used half fresh, half frozen broccoli (as that's what I had on hand), and it was all tasty.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; cook broccoli until bright green, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl of ice water; drain.\nCombine broccoli, garbanzo beans, carrots, raisins, and 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds in a bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper in a separate bowl. Stir dressing into broccoli mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour for flavors to blend. Garnish with about 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds.",
