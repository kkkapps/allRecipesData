These steaks are almost too simple to believe and they turn out great every single time. So tender and flavorful - you just can't mess them up! The adobo seasoning is quite salty, so keep that in mind as you season the steaks.\"",
    "ins": "Season skirt steak pieces all over with adobo seasoning.\nHeat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak in hot oil and butter, turning often, until steak begins to firm, and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 6 to 8 minutes.",
