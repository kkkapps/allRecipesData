    "des": "\"I've been looking for a good sesame chicken recipe. I adapted a few, and this tastes something like what I think it should. I used Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade (on this site).  It tastes a lot like Mr. Yoshida's teriyaki. If you prefer, you can substitute pancake syrup for honey, and fresh ginger for five-spice powder.\"",
    "ins": "In a large resealable plastic bag, combine flour, 1/4 cup sesame seeds, black pepper, five-spice powder, and red pepper flakes. Place a few pieces of chicken at a time into the bag, and shake to coat. Remove to a platter.\nHeat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Place chicken into skillet, and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken, and set aside. Stir onion wedges and bell pepper slices into skillet; cook until slightly browned, about 2 minutes. Remove, and set aside.\nReturn chicken to skillet, and reduce heat to low. Mix in teriyaki marinade, 1/4 cup sesame seeds, and honey; stir until sauce thickens. Return onion and bell pepper to the skillet. Warm through, and serve.",
