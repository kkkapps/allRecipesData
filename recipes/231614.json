    "des": "\"Dig into these tasty finger sandwiches at your next afternoon tea. Creamy, rich goat cheese subtly seasoned with dill and garlic will have even your most discerning tea partiers reaching for seconds.\"",
    "ins": "Combine goat cheese, lemon juice and zest, olive oil, dill and grated garlic in a large bowl and fold together thoroughly with a rubber spatula.\nSpread the soft cheese mixture evenly on all eight pieces of bread. Lay a thin layer of sliced cucumbers on four of the slices. Sprinkle sliced shallot over the cucumber layers and top with the other piece of bread.\nCut each sandwich into three rectangular little tea sandwiches and serve immediately. And you don't have to eat them with your pinkies raised up in the air. But you can. It's kinda fun.",
