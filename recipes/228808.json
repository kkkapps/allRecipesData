    "ins": "Mix 1 cup warm water, 1 tablespoon sugar, and yeast together in a large bowl; let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable oil, egg, salt, 2 cups flour, 7 tablespoons sugar, and 1 cup warm water; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour until dough is soft.\nTurn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 40 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 to 3 baking sheets.\nPunch dough down and turn onto a floured surface. Divide dough into 36 pieces. Shape each piece into a 6-inch rope. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Cover and let rise until doubled in size, about 25 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.\nBeat butter, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder together in a bowl until creamy; serve alongside baked breadsticks.",
