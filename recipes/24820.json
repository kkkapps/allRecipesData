    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Slice chicken strips and set aside.\nIn a large, nonreactive pot, heat sugar and water together over medium high heat, stirring occasionally, until caramelized to a deep amber color.  Remove from heat and slowly (and very carefully--use an oven mitt!) add wine.  Return to heat and stir until all particles are dissolved.  Stirring constantly, add orange juice and wasabi, adjusting the amount to taste.\nBrush chicken strips with the glaze, and then place on a baking sheet.  Bake in the preheated oven until heated through.\nWhile chicken is warming, toss together the tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, avocados, salt, pepper and hot sauce.  Adjust seasonings to taste, and spoon mixture onto the greens.  Top with warmed chicken strips and serve.",
