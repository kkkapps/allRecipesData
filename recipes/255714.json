Grease a 7x5x2-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon butter.\nWhisk sugar, brown rice flour, sorghum flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, powdered milk, baking powder, and nutmeg together in a bowl.

Place peaches gently on top in a single layer. Sprinkle vanilla sugar over the peaches.\nBake in the preheated oven until top and edges are browned, about 45 minutes.
