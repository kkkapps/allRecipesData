    "des": "\"A rich, filling version of Mexican meatball soup. I make the meatballs ahead and freeze them to use as needed. Mild or hot salsa may be used; green chili salsa works particularly well!\"",
    "ins": "Mix together beef broth, salsa, 1 onion, tomatoes, dried basil, oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. (If you use condensed beef broth (e.g., Campbell's), eliminate the salt in the meatballs and use 5 cans (10.5 ounces each) broth plus one quart water.) Bring to a boil and simmer 20 minutes.\nCombine ground chuck, sausage, 1 onion, egg, salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, garlic powder, milk, fresh basil, and cornmeal, and mix well. Form into tiny, bite-size meatballs.\nAdd meatballs and rice to broth. Simmer, covered, very slowly for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
