Rub butter all over the chicken, top and bottom, then season evenly with salt and pepper to taste.\nPour the pineapple juice and orange juice in the tray, not directly over the chicken.\nBake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, basting every 5 to 10 minutes with the juices. When it is done it should be a perfect golden brown.",
