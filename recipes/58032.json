    "des": "\"This is one of my favorite meals: pork tenderloin medallions atop crisp steamed greens, drizzled with a robust olive oil and lime juice dressing.  It is wonderful served with brown rice on the side and the white or blush wine of your choice.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl , whisk olive oil with lime juice. Season with cilantro, garlic salt, and peppercorns.\nBrush the pork tenderloin with three tablespoons of the lime dressing.  Wrap in aluminum foil, and place on in a large baking dish. Roast in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees.\nWhile the tenderloin is cooking, place kale in a steamer. Cook for 20 minutes, or until tender.\nSlice the pork tenderloin into 1 1/2 inch thick slices.  Serve on top of the kale. Whisk the remaining dressing, and drizzle over pork and kale.",
