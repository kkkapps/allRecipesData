    "des": "\"My Grandmother didn't have much money. She was widowed young and she had seven children, so at Christmas she would make these cookies and give each family a box. These cookies are  a very fond memory for me. I now make them for my Grandchildren.\"",
    "ins": "Cream the butter, sugar and eggs together. Add just enough flour to stiffen. Dough should be slightly sticky. Place dough in the refrigerator and let chill overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a very small bowl combine the egg white and the milk. Set aside.\nRemove small amount of dough from the refrigerator and on a lightly floured surface roll it out very thin. Cut out rounds with a biscuit cutter or drinking glass dipped in flour. Place cookies on a cookie sheet and paint the top with the egg white mixture. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and top with a pecan half. Repeat until all the dough is used up.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 minutes and the edges are slightly browned. Watch these cookies closely for they burn very easily.",
