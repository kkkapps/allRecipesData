If I'm going to indulge in dessert, it better be good. Medjool dates, by themselves, no matter how exponentially sweet, are not going to cut it when I want something velvety, chocolatey and rich.\"",
    "ins": "Place the avocados, cocoa powder, maple syrup, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor, and blend until smooth and creamy. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to make the pudding the desired consistency. Eat right away, or chill and serve cold.",
