    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place squash cut-side down onto foil.\nBake squash in preheated oven until tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.\nScoop the cooked squash into the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the cream cheese, then sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar substitute. Beat until smooth, then scoop the squash mixture into a 2 quart baking dish and sprinkle with chopped walnuts.\nReturn the squash to the preheated oven, and bake until hot, about 20 minutes.",
