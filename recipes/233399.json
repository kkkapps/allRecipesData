    "des": "\"I consider this to be the greatest corn-on-the-cob recipe of all time. The way the mild, subtly salted cheese works with an ancho-lime mayonnaise, along with that buttery, smoky corn, is a magnificent combination of flavors. Perfecto!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCombine mayonnaise, lime juice, ancho chile powder, and smoked paprika in a bowl; whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until needed.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil corn in the salted water for 5 minutes. Drain the corn.\nPlace ears of corn on hot grill and cook until the kernels begin to brown and caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the corn and continue to cook, turning ears after 1 to 2 minutes, until they are  browned with slightly charred, caramelized spots.\nGenerously brush corn with melted butter and ancho-lime mayonnaise until kernels are coated. Sprinkle ears with Cotija cheese and salt. Garnish with slices of lime.",
