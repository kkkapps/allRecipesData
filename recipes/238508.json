    "des": "\"Hoisin sauce has an interesting story behind it. I probably should have said confusing rather than interesting. According to my extensive research (5 minutes on Wikipedia), 'hoisin' is a romanticisation of the Cantonese word for seafood. What? Why? It's traditionally served with pork, isn't it?\"",
    "ins": "Whisk pineapple juice, 1/2 cup hoisin sauce, and hot chile paste together in a bowl; pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add spareribs, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.\nRemove spareribs from the marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Pat ribs dry and place on the prepared baking sheet.\nWhisk sea salt, brown sugar, Chinese five-spice powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Season ribs with dry rub.\nBake ribs in the preheated oven for 1 hour.\nStir ketchup, rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and fish sauce together in a bowl until baste is smooth.\nBrush ribs all over with baste. Continue cooking in the oven, turning and basting ribs all over every 15 to 20 minutes, until ribs are tender and falling off the bone, about 3 1/2 hours.",
