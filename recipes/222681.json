    "des": "\"I just love cauliflower and arugula, but never knew how to put them together. I had several attempts and finally came up with this salad. It's a fusion of citrusy and sweet that explodes in your mouth. This is a perfect appetizer if you are serving roasted chicken or seafood.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a saucepan filled with water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and simmer until barely tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain.\nHeat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir cauliflower and corn until cauliflower is tender and corn is heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon honey, turmeric, salt, and black pepper; transfer vegetables to a large bowl.\nWhisk parsley, 1/2 cup olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, 1 tablespoon honey, vinegar, Dijon mustard, and soy sauce in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.\nMix arugula and green onion into cauliflower mixture. Pour parsley dressing over vegetables and toss to combine. Sprinkle oregano over salad.
