    "des": "\"I created this salad version of Hoppin John by combining a number of ingredients from other Hoppin John recipes and adding cilantro, tomatillos, and lemon juice for a zesty flavor. The salad is just as good without red pepper for those with discerning palates. Also as an alternative, a favorite hot sauce can be substituted for the red pepper with each individual serving. I like to add a dash of Louisiana-style cayenne pepper sauce to mine.\"",

Gently stir lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, cilantro, and red pepper flakes into the salad. Chill before serving; serve over romaine lettuce leaves.",
