Bring to a boil, and cook for 10 minutes.\nDrain, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid. Return the apricots and reserved liquid to the pan, and stir in the lemon zest. Mix together the sugar and cornstarch, and stir into the apricot mixture. Bring to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Spread onto the prepared crust, and sprinkle the walnuts over.\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm to the touch. Cool completely before cutting into bars.",
