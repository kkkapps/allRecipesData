    "des": "\"I like to buy a whole pork loin then cut them into chops so that I can get the thickness just right. You can also use the marinade with pork tenderloin, baby back ribs, and chicken.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the beer, rum, molasses, soy sauce, and lime juice into a bowl.  Stir in the garlic, ginger, scotch bonnet pepper, thyme, and marjoram.  Season with allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and bay leaves.  Place the pork chops into a zip top bag, and pour in the marinade.  Refrigerate overnight.\nPrepare an outdoor grill for medium heat.  Take the pork chops out of the marinade, place on a plate, and allow to sit at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes as the grill heats.\nSeason the chops to taste with kosher salt and cracked black pepper.  Grill the chops on both sides until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).  Allow the pork chops to rest for about 5 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.",
