    "des": "\"This stuffing is so tasty, and I can't wait to make it for everyone at Thanksgiving. I did this as a test experiment to see if I could make stuffing that would not make my love miss the bagged wheat-based stuffing. I also wanted it to be so good even our wheat-eating friends wouldn't be able to tell. I think it succeeded! Bake outside the bird or use to stuff a turkey.\"",

Cook and stir onions, celery, and leek in the hot oil until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a bowl and stir gluten-free bread cubes, parsley, sage, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, and 2 tablespoons coconut oil into the vegetables. Moisten dressing with vegetable broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly. Transfer into a 9-inch square baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
