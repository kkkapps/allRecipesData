    "des": "\"This grilled potato recipe is so moist and delicious. It goes great with any meal or on its own, but my favorite is with steak. The cheese tops it off perfectly. Add mushrooms and carrots for an excellent variation. Delicious with sour cream on the side.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for high heat.\nArrange potato slices, separated by onion and butter slices, on a large piece of aluminum foil. Top with garlic, and season with parsley, salt, and pepper. Tightly seal potatoes in the foil.\nPlace on the preheated grill, and cook 20 minutes, turning once, or until potatoes are tender.\nSprinkle potatoes with Cheddar cheese, reseal foil packets, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until cheese is melted.",
