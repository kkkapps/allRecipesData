    "ins": "Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble bacon when cool enough to handle.\nCut each egg in half lengthwise; place half the egg yolks in a bowl, reserving remaining yolks for another use. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in potato flakes, mayonnaise, chives, Dijon mustard, seafood seasoning, black pepper, and red pepper until smooth. Stir shrimp, parsley, and cilantro into yolk mixture.\nArrange egg whites cut-side-up on a serving platter. Spoon about 1 rounded tablespoon yolk mixture into each egg white half; sprinkle with crumbled bacon.",
