    "des": "\"I love pancakes, but I hate everyone else eating fresh pancakes while I am still flipping them, especially if the ones left for me are the first ones i made. . .i.e cold. This recipe ensures that all the 'Puffins' are done at once. You can add a plethora of mix-ins like fresh fruit or a staple in our house Reese's Pieces\u00c2\u00ae. These are really good with a side of maple syrup, or even melted butter; however, plain is good too. I really like them without the mix-ins and peanut butter on top.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 24 mini-muffin cups.\nWhisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.\nStir buttermilk, egg, syrup, and butter together in a separate large bowl until just combined; add flour mixture and stir with a spoon until just combined and no lumps remain. Fold peanut butter pieces into the mixture; spoon into the prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 9 to 12 minutes. Cool in the pans for 3 minutes before serving.",
