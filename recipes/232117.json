Arrange stuffed manicotti shells into the pan. Pour remaining pasta sauce over the stuffed shells. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven until the filling is set and hot in the center, about 45 minutes.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nRemove aluminum foil from baking dish. Sprinkle mozzarella over the manicotti.\nCook under broiler until cheese is melted and slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.",
