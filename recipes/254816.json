Place salmon skin-side down in the center. Brush remaining olive oil and garlic over salmon. Sprinkle dill on top. Divide lemon slices over salmon; squeeze 1/2 lemon on top. Season with 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1/3 teaspoon salt.\nCover salmon with 2 pieces of aluminum foil, shiny-side down. Roll aluminum foil inwards on all sides to create a pouch. Transfer pouches to a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes.\nMix mayonnaise and capers together in a small bowl to make a tartar sauce. Stir in juice from 1 lemon, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.\nServe steamed potatoes, green beans, and tartar sauce alongside salmon.",
