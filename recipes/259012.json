    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.\nCook and stir ground beef and Italian sausage in a skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Drain excess grease, reserving 1 tablespoon in the skillet.\nCook and stir zucchini and yellow squash in the reserved grease until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 3/4 cup pasta sauce in the bottom of a 9x11-inch casserole dish.\nPour remaining pasta sauce into a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in zucchini and yellow squash, whole olives, and sliced olives. Cook and stir until pasta sauce is heated through, about 10 minutes.\nLayer half of the ground meat mixture, penne, hot pasta sauce, Cheddar cheese, and mozzarella cheese over the pasta sauce in the casserole dish. Repeat layers once more.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and layers are heated through, about 30 minutes.",
