    "des": "\"Fresh mild salsa. The flavor is best after it sits for a while as the lime juice will mellow out the flavor of the onion and the salt will bring the juices out of the tomato. If you want to make it fast, chop everything in a food processor, but you will not get the same texture as hand-chopped salsa. Also, if you want it spicy add a little chopped jalapeno. Last, you can use the juice from this pico de gallo to make a quick guacamole, just add some of the pico de gallo juice to the avocados, some extra salt, a little mayo, and your guacamole is ready!\"",
