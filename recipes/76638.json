    "des": "\"My dear Aunt Alma gave me this recipe just after we were stationed overseas - for a taste of home.  Cauliflower and shrimp are baked in a spicy cheese sauce. Adjust the amounts of spices to suit your taste. It is delicious as a main dish with buttered French bread or as a hearty side dish.  Enjoy!\"",
