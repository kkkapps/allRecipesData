    "ins": "Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Remove and discard the skins; roughly mash the potatoes into coarse chunks. Set aside.\nHeat the oil in a skillet. Fry the urad dal, chana dal, mustard seed, and dried red chile peppers in the oil until the seeds begin to splutter. Sprinkle the asafoetida powder over the mixture. Stir the onion, green chile peppers, and curry leaves into the mixture and cook until the onion is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the potatoes, turmeric, red pepper, ginger and salt; cook and stir until the potatoes are thoroughly reheated, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add the lime juice and cilantro to serve.",
