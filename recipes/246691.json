    "ins": "Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nCombine sage, garlic, thyme, rosemary, fennel pollen, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl.\nMake ten 1/2-inch incisions all over the pork. Stuff the incisions with 1/3 of the sage mixture. Brush olive olive over the pork and rub on remaining 2/3 of the sage mixture. Transfer to a roasting pan.\nRoast pork, skin-side up, in the preheated oven until golden, about 2 hours.\nPour wine into the roasting pan. Continue roasting pork, basting with wine at regular intervals, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 3 hours.\nLet pork rest, covered in aluminum foil, for 10 minutes before slicing.",
