    "des": "\"This is wonderful with spaghetti, lasagna, or another Italian dish, but my family likes it with almost anything.  It's very good if made the day before you need it, then split down the middle, buttered, and reheated at mealtime.  I use a bread machine, but it can be made without.  I like to use the dough cycle, then bake it in a French loaf pan.\"",
