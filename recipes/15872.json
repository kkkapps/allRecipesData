    "des": "\"Tiramisu is Italian for 'pick me up'.  This light, roll your eyes, taste bud tantalizer has become a traditional wedding anniversary dessert treat that I've been making for my husband and me for 17 years.  You might call it a happy hubby dessert!  This is my easy version of a classic with the elimination of raw eggs and a wonderful fresh strawberry layer and puree base.  It's delicioso!  It is made to accommodate two extra large portions.\"",
