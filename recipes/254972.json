    "des": "\"A fantastic end-of-summer dish when you have lots of green garden tomatoes and zucchini. This is a nice side dish or even a tasty entree if you add a few more veggies. This is a very versatile recipe. Feel free to add lots of different veggies from the garden. I enjoy green beans, baby carrots, and/or fresh peas.\"",

Add couscous and garlic; cook and stir until couscous is lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.\nStir chicken stock, salt, and pepper into the skillet. Simmer, covered, until couscous is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve garnished with lemon wedge and chopped parsley.",
