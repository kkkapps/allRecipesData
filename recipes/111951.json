    "des": "\"The sauce is good on just about anything from pork, chicken, and seafood. I like it on boneless-skinless chicken breast seasoned with fresh thyme, salt and pepper, broiled until about done then heavily basted with the sauce to finish. This recipe fills a Dutch oven over half the pan. Plenty for leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "Place the onion, red pepper, Scotch bonnet chiles, papaya, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped. Scrape into a large pot, and stir in the mustard powder, sugar, wine, vinegar, water, and lemon juice.\nBring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering, stirring frequently until the mixture has thickened, about 1 hour. Once thick, remove from the heat, and stir in the yellow mustard.",
