Occasionally brushing down sides of pan with a heat-resistant pastry brush, heat candy to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.\nDip apples in hot liquid and place on waxed paper to harden.",
