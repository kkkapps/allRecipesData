    "des": "\"I was following my mother's recipe for ginger snaps and realized I had used the wrong ingredients right away, so rather than throwing it out and starting over, I made my own recipe, and they turned out even better. I just had to share my 'mistake' with you all because I can't believe how good these are. They turned out so delicious, moist, and chewy. I hope you enjoy them.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat butter and 1 cup sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and beat until smooth. Stir molasses into the butter mixture until completely integrated.\nSift flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and cloves together in a separate bowl; add to the butter mixture and mix until you have a dough. Divide and shape the dough into 36 balls.\nPut 1/2 cup sugar in a wide, shallow bowl. Roll dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange onto a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until beginning to crisp around the edges, 13 to 15 minutes.",
