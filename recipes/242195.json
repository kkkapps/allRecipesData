    "des": "\"The all-time favorite pie at our family reunion! Other wild berries can be added to this mixture for variety. Freshly picked berries and baking in a convection oven gets best results. Convection ovens are best for baking this pie. Serve with vanilla ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a pie plate with 1 of the pie pastries.\nStir sugar, flour, chocolate syrup, cinnamon, Key lime pepper, and ancho chile powder together in a large bowl. Add blueberries and stir to coat; pour into prepared pie plate. Sprinkle lemon juice and butter pieces over blueberry mixture. Top with remaining pie pastry, crimp edges together to seal, and cut slits in the top to vent. Cover the edge of the crust with a thin strip of aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove and discard foil. Continue baking until crust is golden and filling is bubbling, about 15 minutes more. Cool completely.",
