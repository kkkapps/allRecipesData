    "des": "\"Every year when we visit friends on Cape Cod we celebrate Thanksgiving in July. I incorporated some of the fresh herbs from my friend's garden and came up with this recipe as a way to use up leftover turkey. Serve the salad on croissants, crusty rolls, or a bed of lettuce. A lighter version can be made using reduced fat mayonnaise and sour cream.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the turkey, celery, cranberries, and walnuts together in a bowl.\nTo make the dressing, whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream, parsley, rosemary, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour over the turkey mixture, and toss to coat evenly. Refrigerate the salad for at least 1 hour. Serve cold.",
