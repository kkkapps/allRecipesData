    "des": "\"Breaded buttermilk fried chicken and a pan-drippings gravy with milk or cream. The gravy is great on the chicken, but mash up some potatoes with some butter and cream and bake up some cornbread or biscuits and you have the quintessential southern meal  with some northern urban twists.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk buttermilk, onion powder, parsley, tarragon, sage, paprika, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper in a bowl. Place chicken breast pieces in buttermilk mixture, stir to coat, and marinate in refrigerator at least 8 hours (up to 2 days).

Close bag and shake to coat chicken.\nFry coated chicken in hot oil until golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes on the first side and 6 to 8 minutes on the second side.
