    "ins": "Spread 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce on two tortillas. Then sprinkle with 1/2  cup shredded cheese and 1/2 cup pepperoni.\nOptional: Instead of pepperoni, add 1/2 cup sliced veggies (mushrooms, black olives), sliced or 1/2 cup cooked chicken, chopped.\nPlace other two tortillas on top and press down slightly.\nThis step should involve an adult. Place quesadilla in a warmed skillet until cheese melts and tortilla is golden brown.\nFlip quesadilla over to evenly brown other side.\nRemove from skillet and allow pizza quesadilla to cool slightly.\nCut each pizza quesadilla into quarters.\nPlace Edible Disney(R)Decals on Tortillas and enjoy (instructions on back of Mission Kid Size Tortilla package).",
