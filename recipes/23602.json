    "des": "\"This sauce came from a good friend's Italian mother-in-law. It is easy, and by far the best homemade sauce I know of. Great for both spaghetti and lasagna. Pssst...the secret is the sugar! Also, as I am now vegetarian, it tastes great with out the meat! Just substitute two tablespoons olive oil for the beef.\"",
    "ins": "Blend the stewed tomatoes and crushed tomatoes in a blender. In a stock pot or large kettle, brown the ground beef with the onions, peppers, garlic. Pour in tomatoes, and reduce heat.  Add sugar, basil and oregano, and simmer about 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper before serving.",
