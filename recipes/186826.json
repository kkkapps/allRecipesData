    "des": "\"This is a nice creamy and spicy dip. It's just perfect for dipping potato or corn chips while watching football. I say serving size is 12, but I have found that some football fans can consume a quarter of this recipe in 1 hour. If this is the only dip you have for a 3 hour game and you have 4 munchers, than you will need to increase the serving size to 24 servings.\"",
