    "des": "\"I love this recipe for a quick breakfast. I made it up as a quick alternative to oatmeal. I can set the quinoa to cook while I do my makeup in the mornings. I like the apple cinnamon version, but you can really change the mix-ins to suit your own tastes or for variation throughout the seasons.\"",
    "ins": "Combine water, quinoa, cinnamon stick, and nutmeg in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes.\nRemove saucepan from heat and discard cinnamon stick. Mix apple, honey, and chia seeds into the quinoa. Let sit until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.",
