    "des": "\"An entire head of cauliflower roasted with butter, garlic, and herbs. Can convert cauliflower-avoiders into cauliflower-lovers! A beautiful and delicious way to serve cauliflower. Never any leftovers. Can substitute low-fat butter for butter.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix butter, dill, garlic, lemon zest, cumin, salt, and ground black pepper in a bowl.\nCut cauliflower stem flush with the rest of the head so it can stay upright in a casserole dish. Spread butter mixture evenly over the top and sides of cauliflower, place in a casserole dish, and cover with foil.\nRoast in the preheated oven until tender and cooked through, about 1 1/4 hours. Transfer to a platter and spoon any liquid in the casserole dish over the cauliflower.",
