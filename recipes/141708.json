Gradually beat in the sugar until stiff peaks form. Refrigerate cream until needed.\nCut pound cake into slices 1/3 inch wide, discarding cake ends.\nAssemble the trifle by placing a layer of cake slices in the bottom of a glass serving bowl. Spoon half the berry mixture with juice over the cake slices. Cover with half of the whipped cream, and sprinkle with half the coconut. Repeat layering with the remaining cake slices, berries and juice, whipped cream, and coconut. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.",
