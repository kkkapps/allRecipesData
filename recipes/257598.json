    "des": "\"Chicken with rice, or arroz con pollo, is a staple at our house. This dish is highly\n seasoned with cumin, ginger, garlic, and a great deal of cilantro. We like it best when it \nis made with chicken wings.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a pot large enough to hold chicken wings in a single layer. Add chicken wings; cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Turn wings with tongs; cook until second side is browned, about 8 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl using tongs.\nStir onions, garlic, and ginger into the drippings in the pot; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in rice and cumin. Add water, 1 1/2 cup cilantro stems, tomatoes, sriracha sauce, and salt.\nReturn wings to the pot. Bring broth to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice and wings are tender, about 30 minutes. Garnish with remaining 1/2 cup cilantro stems.",
