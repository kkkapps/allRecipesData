    "des": "\"I got this recipe from a family member and it has been a favorite since. It is so simple to make, but is definitely a crowd-pleaser! With the majority of the ingredients being fat-free, it is one that you make and not feel guilty about serving. My kids ask me to make it every time we go to any type of gathering, and when I bring it everyone says they love it.\"",
