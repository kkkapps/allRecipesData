    "des": "\"Came up with this recipe because I have 2 avid fishermen in my home and plenty of trout to cook.\n Also have a recipe for an easy homemade cocktail sauce, which goes well with the patties, but it's optional.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap up trout in a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nPlace trout in the prepared pan; drizzle butter and lemon juice on top. Fold up aluminum foil to enclose trout in a packet.\nBake in the preheated oven until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 1 hour. Cool for 10 minutes. Flake into a large bowl; add onion and celery. Mix in seasoned bread crumbs.\nBeat eggs, mayonnaise, and lemon pepper seasoning in a small bowl until blended. Mix into trout mixture. Form trout mixture into 12 patties.\nHeat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Fry patties in batches until deep golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side.\nMix ketchup and horseradish together in a small bowl to make cocktail sauce. Serve with trout patties.",
