    "ins": "Soak ancho chilies in a bowl of warm water until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.\nWhisk eggs and shrimp powder together in a bowl.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat; pour egg mixture into small 2-inch circles in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining egg mixture.\nBlend ancho chilies, onion, garlic, and water in a blender until smooth. Add more water if needed to make a soup consistency. Pour chile mixture into a pot over medium heat; add chicken bouillon and egg patties. Cook and stir until bouillon is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add nopales, reduce heat to low, and cook until soup is heated through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.",
