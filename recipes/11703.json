    "des": "\"This pasta salad is a little different: the dressing is made with olive oil and anchovies. This is a good, light meal for the summer.\"",
    "ins": "Put a large pot of salted water on to boil; use this water to blanch the broccoli and cook the pasta.  Blanch broccoli in boiling water.  When it is al dente, transfer broccoli to a bowl of ice water.  Drain thoroughly.\nCook penne in salted, boiling water until al dente.  Drain.  Rinse under cold running water until completely cooled, and then drain completely.\nMeanwhile, place tuna in a skillet with water, white wine, and lemon juice. Cover, and cook until done. Break fish into chunks.\nCombine broccoli, penne, fish, tomatoes, cheese, olives, walnuts, garlic, and parsley in a large serving bowl.\nHeat olive oil in small pan over low heat.  Cut anchovy fillets into small pieces, add to the olive oil, and mash with a fork until they dissolve.  Do not let oil get too hot.  Pour oil-anchovy mixture over salad. Toss, and serve immediately.",
