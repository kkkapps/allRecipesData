    "des": "\"Good recipe using eggplant and wheat berries. Also a tasty way to use up all those cherry tomatoes in your garden. You can also pan-fry or bake the eggplant instead of grilling it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nBrush eggplant slices with about 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nGrill eggplant on the preheated grill until tender and lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side.\nHeat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken broth, wheat berries, barley, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and allspice to onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until wheat berries are tender and some liquid is still remaining, about 40 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir tomatoes and black beans into wheat berries mixture; remove pot from heat. Stir eggplant into wheat berries mixture; pour into a 9x9-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.",
