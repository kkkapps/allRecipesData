    "des": "\"This is based on Joan MacKinnon's really great 'Spiced Pork Chop' recipe, modified based on numerous reviews from others and trial and error. This is my current favorite version for empty nesters (i.e. two servings). The gravy is optional but very tasty. It is important to use the size pan indicated so that wine sauce can spread out and evolve. I find the gravy is better if not too thick. Also use milk if you want a thinner gravy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x14-inch baking dish.\nMix flour, garlic powder, mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper, celery salt, ground ginger, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper together in a shallow dish.\nDredge pork chops in the flour mixture to coat. Reserve remaining flour mixture.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to prepared baking dish, reserving any drippings in the skillet.\nStir sherry, water, and brown sugar together until sugar dissolves; pour over pork chops.\nBake in preheated oven until tender and no longer pink in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Move pork chops to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Pour liquid from baking dish into the skillet with reserved drippings.\nPlace skillet with drippings mixture to medium-low heat. Stir cream into the drippings. Cook and stir, gradually integrating reserved flour mixture, until the mixture begins to thicken. Serve as a gravy for the pork chops.",
