    "des": "\"Quite a lot like hush puppies, but made with grated summer squash.  The squash makes them moist and tender on the inside, and the cornmeal mix makes them crisp and brown on the outside.  These are delicious with fish (of course), chicken, and other grilled meats.\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, mix the egg, cornmeal mix, squash, onion, onion powder, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined (mixture may seem a little dry).\nHeat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and drop the squash mixture by large spoonfuls into the hot oil to form patties. Cook until brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.",
