    "des": "\"This is different twist on cabbage slaw. It's very easy and the mango and honey make it sweet; no sugar in this recipe! Great by itself or wrap a corn tortilla around grilled tilapia and top with this cilantro slaw for a great-tasting fish taco! For a bit thicker dressing you can add additional mayonnaise.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk vinegar, oil, honey, mayonnaise, celery seed, poppy seeds, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Add cabbage, mango, cilantro, and green onions; toss until well-combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, about 1 hour.",
