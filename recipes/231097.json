    "des": "\"This is my first attempt at making caldo de pollo. I think it turned out great. You might need to add salt to taste as my recipe doesn't have very much. I like to serve this with warm corn tortillas and a side of Spanish rice and refried beans. Please enjoy and let me know what you think.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken legs into a large stock pot and pour water over chicken; add garlic, salt, and garlic powder. Cover, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until chicken meat falls off the bones, 1 to 2 hours. Stir in chicken bouillon cube and let dissolve.\nMix carrots, potatoes, zucchini, chayote, and white onion in the broth, turn heat to medium-low, and cook soup at a low boil until carrots and potatoes are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir chopped cilantro into soup, simmer for 5 minutes, and serve.",
