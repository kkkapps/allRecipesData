Blend until the mixture has turned into a coarse paste.\nHeat 3 tablespoons of oil in the saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sliced onions, and cook until the onions have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ginger and garlic, continue cooking until the garlic softens and mellows, about 3 minutes more. Stir in the cayenne pepper, salt, and turmeric; continue cooking 2 minutes.\nMix in the tomato paste, goat meat, pureed peppercorn sauce, and the remaining 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.",
