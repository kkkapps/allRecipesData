Season with Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper; stir until evenly mixed.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Form the crab mixture into patties 3/4-inch thick. Cook in the hot oil until golden brown on each side and hot in the center, about 2 minutes per side.
