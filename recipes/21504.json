    "ins": "Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, reserving drippings, crumble and set aside.\nIn a large bowl sift together flour, salt and baking powder.  Gently stir in parsley and pepper.  In a 1 cup measuring cup, beat eggs and add enough milk to reach the 1/2 cup level.  Stir the egg mixture and the bacon drippings into the flour; stir with a fork until well blended.  Add more milk if dough is too dry.  Stir in the crumbled bacon; mix well.\nIn a 2 quart saucepan heat broth over medium heat.  Drop dough by spoonfuls into simmering broth.  Cover and cook about 12 minutes, or until done.",
