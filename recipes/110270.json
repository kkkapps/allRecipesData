    "des": "\"This molasses-raisin bread is an old favorite from Newfoundland. If you do not care for caraway seed, you may substitute 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg.\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve 2 teaspoons of sugar in 1 cup of water.  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and allow to soften for 5 to 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, stir together the molasses, salt, 6 tablespoons of sugar, and shortening into the remaining 3 cups of water in a large bowl until dissolved.  Add the raisins, flour, and caraway seed.\nMix together until a dough forms, then turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes.  Place into a well oiled bowl, and brush the top with a little melted shortening.  Cover with a cloth and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.\nPunch down, and allow to rise again until doubled in bulk, another hour.\nLightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.  Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface, punch down, then form into two loaves.  Place loaves into the pans, cover with a cloth, and allow to rise again until doubled in size.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake loaves in preheated oven for 1 hour until they are nicely browned and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.",
