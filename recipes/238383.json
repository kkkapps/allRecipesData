Cool crumble to room temperature.\nSprinkle 1/2 of the crumble into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBeat raspberries, white sugar, egg whites, and lemon juice together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 10 minutes. Fold whipped topping into raspberry mixture; pour over crumble in the 9x13-inch dish. Sprinkle remaining crumble over raspberry mixture.\nFreeze raspberry mixture until solid, at least 2 hours.
