    "des": "\"This is a recipe I learned from a very good friend, and every time I make it there isn't a wing left over. Always a 5-star with friends and family. You can tweak the recipe how you like. Less butter gives you a thicker sauce. I prefer a thinner sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nFry chicken wings in small batches in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Assure oil reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) between batches.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir hot sauce, ranch dressing mix, and vinegar into the melted butter.\nPut cooked chicken wings in a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over wings and toss to coat.",
