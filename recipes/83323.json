    "des": "\"My mom made this as a throw together meal when I was a kid  She was surprised when, as an adult, I served it 'outside the family'.  It's a wonderful kid-pleaser, and very easy to make.  A meal in itself!  Although, cornbread on the side is a great touch. Even the leftovers are delicious, warmed or cold.  I often find myself with a fork digging into the leftover bowl right out of the fridge:)\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the seashells, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.\nPlace bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, stirring occasionally. Drain off most of the fat, and add the onion to the skillet. Cook and stir until transparent. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your liking. Serve sauce over pasta.",
