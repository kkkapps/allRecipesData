    "des": "\"This recipe makes a wonderfully light and fluffy biscuit.  A great way to use up those leftover mashed sweet potatoes.  Makes a delicious sandwich with a slice ham, or simply topped with butter.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Cut in the shortening until pieces of shortening are pea-sized or smaller. Mix in the sweet potatoes, and enough of the milk to make a soft dough.\nTurn dough out onto a floured surface, and roll or pat out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into circles using a biscuit cutter or a drinking glass. Place biscuits 1 inch apart onto a greased baking sheet.\nBake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.",
