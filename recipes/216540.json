    "des": "\"A fun twist on banana bread. The cranberries add a sweet and tart flavor that really kicks up the flavor of this bread. Super moist and super flavorful, it's a great addition to brunch! If you like more of a buttery taste, try brushing the top of the baked loaf with a pastry brush and a little bit of melted butter.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 1/2 x 8 1/2-inch loaf pan with butter. Whisk the flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; set aside.\nWhisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth. Beat in the bananas, sour cream, and melted butter. Add the sugar, cranberries, and lemon juice; beat until evenly blended. Fold into the oat mixture until no dry lumps remain. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
