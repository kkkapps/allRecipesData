    "des": "\"This is a simple recipe for sweet potato casserole. But it is also the best I have tasted, enriched with eggs, milk, and rum, and topped with a crunchy pecan streusel. It is a standard at all holiday dinners in my family. The amount of rum can be varied according to taste (the casserole is also good without it.)\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn a large bowl, mix the sweet potatoes and sugar. Stir in the eggs. Mix in milk, vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup melted butter. Gradually stir in the rum until well blended. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish.\nIn a medium bowl, mix the brown sugar, pecans, flour, and 1/3 cup melted butter. Sprinkle this mixture over the mashed sweet potato mixture.\nBake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to sit at least 10 minutes before serving.",
