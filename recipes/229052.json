    "des": "\"A gluten-free, soy-free, cow dairy-free New York cheesecake that has that decadent mouth-feel. I have served it several times without anyone noticing it wasn't the REAL STUFF. At a recent party my husband mentioned that he had not had cheesecake for 20 years because of his allergies so this became my goal and voila! Enjoy!\"",

Press crumb mixture into bottom of prepared pan; place pan in the freezer.\nBeat chevre and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth.

Add coconut yogurt, vanilla extract, and gluten-free flour; mix just until incorporated.\nPour cheesecake batter into chilled crust and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn oven off and allow cake to cool in oven with its door closed for at least 2 hours. Refrigerate for an additional 4 to 6 hours before serving.",
