Cook for 3 minutes, then add the almond milk, and return to a simmer.\nOnce the almond milk is simmering, stir in the bouillon and broccoli. Cook until the broccoli is very tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the walnuts, honey, and soy sauce. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water, then stir into the simmering soup until thickened. Serve sprinkled with sesame seeds.",
