    "ins": "Cream butter and sugar. Beat in eggs.\nDissolve the baking soda in the milk, then add to mixture. Add the vanilla and mix well\nPlace salt in with flour and slowly stir into mixture.  The dough should not be too sticky and should pull away from the sides of the bowl easily. If the dough is sticky, add a little more flour.\nForm the dough into a roll about a foot long and 2-3 inches in diameter.  Roll up in wax paper and put in the refrigerator for 1 hour.\nRemove from refrigerator and let dough come to room temperature. Roll out dough a chunk at a time (one dough log makes about 4 chunks).\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).\nCut your cookies and decorate or bake plain for 8-10 minutes.  Enjoy!",
