    "des": "\"I came up with this simple and easy recipe with stuff I had around the house. I was very pleased with the outcome. A quick fix for a zingy and flavorful dish. If you want to add a little more Italian cheesy flare to it, try tossing the pasta with 3/4 cup each shredded Asiago & Fontina cheeses. Enjoy.\"",

Mix in tuna, wine, lemon juice, and remaining olive oil. Continue cooking 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and transfer to a bowl.\nToss the cooked pasta with Parmesan cheese. Top with the skillet mixture to serve.",
