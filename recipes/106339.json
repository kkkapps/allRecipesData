In a small bowl, mix together the tomato sauce, onion, garlic salt, and chili powder.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat.\nCook the patties in the hot skillet 4 to 5 minutes; flip and cook an additional 4 minutes. Pour the tomato sauce mixture into the skillet as the burgers finish cooking; simmer for another 4 to 5 minutes. Top each burger with Cheddar cheese and allow to melt. Place burgers on bread and ladle sauce on the patties before closing each sandwich.",
