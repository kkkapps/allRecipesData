Mix together brandy and milk; add alternately with 4 1/2 cups flour to creamed mixture.  Make 3 dry and 2 liquid additions, combining lightly after each.\nIn another bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar to form stiff but moist peaks.  Fold into batter.  Fold in floured fruit mixture.\nBake for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours, depending on size of pan.  Bake each cake until it tests done with a toothpick.  Remove from pans, and lift off paper.  Cool.",
