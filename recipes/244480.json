    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly sprinkle flour over paper.\nWhisk flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk oil and egg together in a separate bowl until smooth; add honey and mix well. Mix oil mixture into flour mixture just until batter is moistened. Sprinkle sugar over figs in a bowl and toss to coat; fold into batter.\nTransfer batter to the middle of the prepared baking sheet and form into a 7-inch circle.\nBake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Score the batter into 8 sections and continue baking until scones are cooked through and lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes more. Cut into 8 scones and slide every other scone back from the circle to allow cooling.",
