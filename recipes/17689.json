    "des": "\"Bone-in chicken breasts stuffed with spinach, cheese and onion and baked until tender. This is a simple recipe that I cooked up myself. It is, however, based on some pretty standard Greek/Italian dishes. Everyone loves this and it can be wonderful for company - even people who don't usually like spinach find that they like this dish! Serve with your favorite shaped pasta, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, combine the spinach, Parmesan cheese and onion and mix thoroughly. Stuff the cavity of each chicken breast with 1/4 of the mixture. (NOTE: Bone-in split breasts usually have a little cavity; if one is not naturally present, use a sharp knife to make a slit in the side of the breast.)\nLay stuffed breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with the sauce.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 35 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and tender; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and bake another 5 minutes, until cheese is melted.",
