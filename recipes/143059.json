    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray.\nBeing careful not to slice them into two separate pieces, make a lengthwise slit from the top of every hot dog to the bottom. Spread open the franks, then place them side by side flat side-up on the baking sheet.\nSeason each hot dog with a pinch of celery salt, then put a slice of cheese on top of each frank. Spread a thin layer of barbeque sauce over each piece of cheese.\nBake until cheese is slightly browned on edges, about 10 minutes.",
