    "des": "\"These moist, fudgy brownies started out as an impromptu experiment when I realized too late I was out of baking chocolate. Now it's one of my favorite brownie recipes! The Nutella\u00c2\u00ae and Frangelico\u00c2\u00ae give them a distinctly nutty flavor without interrupting the smooth texture. I love these brownies with cold milk or hot coffee.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking pan or line with parchment paper.\nMelt butter, hazelnut liqueur, and chocolate-hazelnut spread together in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until starting to bubble, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool slightly.\nWhisk flour, cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl.\nBeat white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; slowly mix in butter mixture until smooth. Stir flour mixture into butter-sugar mixture just until batter is combined; fold in chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool brownies in pan for at least 2 hours before cutting.",
