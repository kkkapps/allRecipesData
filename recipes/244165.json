    "des": "\"I was looking for a mildly sweet treat to have with tea that wasn't filled with butter or artificial ingredients in general.  These are delicious! They happen to be paleo-friendly as well. The best things really are the simplest. I like coconut sugar because it's less sweet, but any sugar would work. These cookies freeze really well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.\nWhisk egg white, coconut sugar, and almond extract together in a bowl. Fold almond flour into egg mixture until just combined; spread batter into baking dish. Sprinkle almonds over top of batter and press down lightly.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack using the parchment to lift it out of baking dish. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.",
