    "des": "\"I tried this cut of meat when it was on sale, and for lack of any other ideas I took suggestions from the back of the label, with a few tweaks (like making gravy). This is a very popular dish at our house, and it could not be easier! Instead of rubbing the roast with the onion soup mix and then adding the cranberry sauce, you can also just mix the onion soup mix with the cranberry sauce and pour the whole mixture over the roast.\"",
    "ins": "Rub pork roast all over with onion soup mix and place roast in the slow cooker. Pour cranberry sauce over roast.\nCook on Low for 8 to 10 hours. Remove roast to a platter, reserving juices in the slow cooker.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Whisk flour into melted butter to form a paste. Pour reserved juices from the slow cooker into the butter mixture, whisking constantly, until gravy lightens in color and thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
