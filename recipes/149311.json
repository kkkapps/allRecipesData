    "des": "\"This super-easy side dish utilizes the bounty of late summer and is the perfect companion to whatever you are grilling - in fact, the stove can be turned on while the meat is resting from the grill.  The sweet acidity of the berries balances the entire meal, and the fresh oregano brings out the best of both the berries and the beans.  It's a beautiful, unusual side dish that leaves guests, and even finicky family, raving.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a saucepan with 1 inch of water, and insert a steamer basket. Place the green beans into the steamer basket, and sprinkle with oregano, celery salt, and onion powder. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Steam for 5 minutes, then remove beans from steamer basket, and place into a large bowl.\nGently fold in the blackberries, allowing the heat from the green beans to pull out their juices. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.",
