    "des": "\"A tasty twist to salsa; great served over cream cheese with tortilla chips or crackers! A great way to save those green tomatoes when there is an early frost. \nI created this recipe with the assistance of my daughter-in-law Carolyn and her niece Felicia. Thanks you two. Portion out remaining salsa into bags; freeze or refrigerate.\"",
    "ins": "Combine green tomatoes, onions, jalapeno peppers, serrano peppers, and red bell pepper in a large bowl.\nMix cilantro, sugar, garlic, oregano, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.\nFill a blender with about 2 cups tomato mixture, 1 teaspoon lime juice, and 1/4 of the spice mixture; blend to desired consistency and pour into a large bowl. Repeat blending with remaining tomato mixture, lime juice, and spice mixture, working in batches, until all ingredients are blended. Stir vinegar into salsa.",
