    "des": "\"We have a flock of laying hens and usually an abundance of eggs. I'm always trying to find new ways to prepare them. Oh man are they good! It's a unique twist to the more traditional pickled egg recipes out there. These are great on salads, or just as is.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil; remove from heat, cover, and let sit until eggs are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Drain hot water; cover eggs with cold water.\nPeel eggs and place in a quart-size Mason jar.\nCombine soy sauce, water, sugar, minced onion, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool briefly, about 5 minutes. Pour over eggs in the jar.\nRefrigerate eggs until flavors are absorbed, at least 6 hours.",
