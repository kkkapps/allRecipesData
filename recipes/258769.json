    "des": "\"You are sure to see people enjoying coffee granita if you visit Sicily during the summer months. Here's the recipe so you can make it at home. It's very easy to do but requires a lot of freezing so best to prepare in advance. It's usually served with whipped cream both at the bottom and on top of the glass, alongside a sweet brioche roll. You can store in the freezer for a few days, just make sure to stir well before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan; simmer until a candy thermometer reads 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), about 5 minutes.\nRemove saucepan from heat; add coffee and vanilla extract. Pour into a metal bowl and mix well. Cool granita mixture to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Freeze for 1 hour.\nStir the granita vigorously to break up ice crystals. Repeat freezing and breaking up process 4 to 5 more times, 2 to 2 1/2 hours total.\nDrop spoonfuls of whipped cream into 4 short glasses. Divide granita mixture evenly among the glasses. Top with remaining whipped cream.",
