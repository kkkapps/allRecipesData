    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.\nIn a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In a large bowl, beat together the butter, oil and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla.  Blend this mixture into the flour mixture; just to combine. Fold in the mango, raisins, walnuts and coconut; mixing just enough to evenly combine.\nLet stand for 20 minutes then bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.",
