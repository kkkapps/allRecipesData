    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace the onion, carrots, and water into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth, adding more water if needed.\nIn a large bowl, combine the ground chuck, pork, matzo meal, and eggs. Stir in the onion and carrot puree a little at a time until the meat mixture holds its shape (you may not need all the puree). Season with garlic, salt, and black pepper.\nShape the meat mixture into a loaf and transfer to a baking dish. Pour the browning sauce and any remaining onion puree  on top of the loaf. Fill baking dish with about 2-inches of water, then cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until loaf is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Remove the foil and pour ketchup in a zig-zag shape over the loaf during the last 15 minutes of baking. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow the meat loaf to rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.",
