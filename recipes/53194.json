    "ins": "Heat a large pot of water to boiling.\nPeel potatoes, and keep submerged in cold water to prevent browning. Grate potatoes, by hand or with a food processor,  into a large bowl. Drain any excess water. Stir in flour and salt. With a teaspoon, form a test dumpling. If it doesn't hold together, Stir in more flour.\nForm dumplings with a teaspoon, and gently drop into boiling water. Allow dumplings to float freely. Gently stir with wooden spoon so dumplings don't stick together. Reduce heat to slow boil. Boil for 40 minutes.\nDrain in colander. Rinse with hot water. Serve with gravy or melted butter.",
