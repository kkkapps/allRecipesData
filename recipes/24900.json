    "des": "\"Wonton wrappers are filled with cream cheese, crab meat (I use imitation, but you can use either), garlic, and onions. You just have to heat them so the cheese is melted hot. Don't overcook. Serve with rice and sweet and sour sauce. Good as an appetizer, or meal.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, imitation crabmeat, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and green onions.\nPlace approximately 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture in the center of each wonton wrapper.\nPlace egg whites in a small bowl. Using the fingers, spread egg white over two edges of the wonton wrappers. Fold into triangles and press to seal edges.\nIn small batches, deep fry the wontons until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.",
