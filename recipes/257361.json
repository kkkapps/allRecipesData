    "des": "\"Chickpeas are surprisingly fishy, and when they're mashed, taste a lot like tuna! Mix it with nori and the usual tuna salad suspects (like carrots and onion) for a vegan 'tuna' sandwich.\"",
    "ins": "Pulse nori in a blender until it's a fine powder. Set aside to let dust settle.\nMash chickpeas with a sturdy fork or a small-holed potato masher (chickpeas slip through larger, zigzag-type mashers) in a large bowl until most are broken up. Do not overmash--they should retain some texture.\nStir in mayo and mash a little more. Stir in nori powder, carrot, celery, onion, dill, salt, and pepper. Cover and chill at least 15 minutes or up to 3 days.\nFor the sandwiches, slather toast with mayo (about 1 1/2 teaspoons per slice). Layer salad, lettuce, and tomato between toast slices. Cut sandwiches in half diagonally.",
