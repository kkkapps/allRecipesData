    "des": "\"Not the best picture, I know, but it tastes sooo good! Kewa Datshi - literally meaning potatoes and cheese - is a delicious thick gravy-like Bhutanese dish that is made up of potatoes, chiles, and cheese. Serve it like a soup or along with rice! I had it for the first time when I visited Bhutan and fell in live with its flavors. This is my recreation of that dish and tastes almost the same. An authentic kewa datshi is very spicy but in this recipe I have toned it down as I cannot handle that much spice. But you can adjust the amount of chiles to your liking. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir chile peppers and garlic until golden and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir potatoes into onion mixture until potatoes are coated in oil.\nPour water over potato mixture and season with chile pepper powder and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, adding more water if needed but keeping the gravy thick, 10 to 15 minutes.\nReduce heat to low and sprinkle fresh cheese over the gravy; slowly stir until cheese melts and spreads evenly, about 5 minutes. Garnish dish with red pepper flakes.",
