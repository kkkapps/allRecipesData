Remove skin from potatoes; quarter and slice.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.\nCombine potatoes, bacon, onion, celery, and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, milk, sour cream, vinegar, celery salt, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl. Fold mayonnaise mixture into potato mixture until incorporated. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight to allow flavors to blend.",
