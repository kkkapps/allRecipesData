    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.\nAfter removing the seeds from the squash, rinse with water, and remove any strings and bits of squash. Pat dry, and place in a small bowl.  Stir the olive oil and salt into the seeds until evenly coated. Spread out in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes, or until seeds start to pop. Remove from oven and cool on the baking sheet before serving.",
