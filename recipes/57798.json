    "des": "\"This is a recipe I discovered about 25 years ago when grape gelatin was hard to find!  It's a terrific side dish or a delicious dessert.  It's very rich in flavor and can be made ahead of time.  Also good with cherry gelatin and cherry pie filling.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together gelatin powder, boiling water, pineapple and pie filling. Pour into a mold, or glass baking dish, and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Spread over the top of the gelatin. If using a mold, unmold the gelatin before applying topping.",
