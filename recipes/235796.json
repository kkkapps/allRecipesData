    "des": "\"Years ago, I came up with my clone of a dish my children really enjoyed. I wanted to use the freshest ingredients that I usually have on hand. Many years later, I find myself still making it. If serving a beef dish, substitute chicken bouillon with beef bouillon. Angel hair pasta can be broken into small pieces in place of vermicelli.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook rice and vermicelli in hot butter until browned, about 3 minutes.\nPour water over the rice mixture. Stir chicken bouillon, parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder into the water; bring to a boil, place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook until the water has absorbed into the rice and pasta, about 25 minutes.",
