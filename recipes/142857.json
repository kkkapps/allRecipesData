    "des": "\"This is my version of the 'triple fried-egg chili chutney sandwich' mentioned in season 2 of 'Red Dwarf.' To quote, 'The ingredients are all wrong, but they work.'\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the eggs until the white is completely set, but the yolks are still soft , flipping once.\nSpread the mango chutney evenly on four pieces of toasted bread. Place a fried egg on a slice of bread, break the yolk and season egg with a dash of chili sauce. Repeat with two of the remaining pieces of toast and the remaining two eggs. Stack the pieces so that the egg and toast alternate layers. Place the final piece of toast on top and serve immediately.",
