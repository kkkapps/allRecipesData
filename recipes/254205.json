    "des": "\"A Sicilian classic, spicy broccoli and tomatoes tossed with short-cut pasta. This pairs nicely with a cold glass of milk to help calm the heat!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in 1 pepper.\nCut an \"x\" shape in the bottom of each tomato. Add tomatoes and broccoli to water. Simmer until broccoli has softened slightly and the tomato skins have separated from the pulp, about 5 minutes. Remove the tomatoes and broccoli with a slotted spoon. When tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove and discard skins.\nBring the water to a boil again. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 1 minute less than time indicated on package or 6 to 7 minutes total. Drain.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet. Add the broccoli, remaining sliced cayenne pepper, and tomatoes. Stir in drained pasta and cook over medium heat until heated through and blended.\nTop with cheese and extra-virgin olive oil before serving.",
