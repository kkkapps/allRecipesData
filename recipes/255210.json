    "des": "\"I grew up in my family's restaurant. I revamped this recipe to make it a little healthier. The original recipe was one of my dad's, who was a master chef. People came from all over West Texas to eat 'Stanton's Hot Rolls' and cake doughnuts. I had gained almost 200 pounds and decided to make some changes. At 75 pounds lighter, I'm changing the recipes. Took out the bad cholesterol and added the good. I took out the eggs and cut the salt in half.\"",
    "ins": "Combine 2 1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment.\nHeat milk, water, and 1/3 cup coconut oil in a saucepan until a thermometer inserted into the mixture reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.\nPour milk mixture over flour; beat together on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups flour until a soft, sticky dough forms.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.\nPlace dough in a bowl; cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.\nGrease 24 muffin cups. Divide dough into 48 equal-sized balls; place 2 balls into each prepared muffin cup. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Brush tops with 1 tablespoon coconut oil.",
