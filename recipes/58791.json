    "des": "\"Pork butt is marinated in a savory blend of spices, before being grilled on skewers and served with a sprinkle of fresh lime juice.\"",
    "ins": "In a glass bowl or dish, mix together the salt, pepper, coriander, cumin seed, and vegetable oil. Add pork cubes, and stir to coat. Let stand for 20 minutes. Add onion, brown sugar, soy sauce, and ginger; stir to blend. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour, but best overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Thread pork cubes onto skewers.\nCook pork on the grill, basting frequently with the remaining marinade. Turn occasionally until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Serve sprinkled with lime juice to taste. Discard any unused marinade.",
