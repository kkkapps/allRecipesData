If you are a white chocolate fan, use foil-wrapped white chocolate pieces instead of milk chocolate. Make these for a game day party or any get-together, and you will be very popular.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace pretzels on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.\nPlace an unwrapped chocolate piece onto each pretzel.\nHeat the pretzels and chocolate candies in the preheated oven until the milk chocolate pieces become soft but hold their shape, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch carefully and don't let the chocolate melt to the point of dripping.\nRemove the pretzels from the oven and allow to stand for 1 minute to allow candy to finish softening.\nPush a colored candy-coated piece into the center of each chocolate kiss, pushing it down and flattening it. Set treats aside to cool to room temperature and fully set, about 30 minutes.",
