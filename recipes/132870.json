    "ins": "Place the Brussels sprouts into a large saucepan and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender enough to easily pierce with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to dry for a few minutes.\nPlace the Brussels sprouts into a serving dish and toss with melted butter to coat. Stir in the breadcrumbs gently until evenly distributed.",
