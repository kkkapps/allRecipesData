    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a 9 inch cast iron skillet on the center rack.\nWhen the skillet is hot, carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Pour the canola oil into the skillet and gently swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides. Return the pan to the oven for ten minutes.\nWhile the oil is heating, mix together the cornmeal and salt in a medium bowl. Add the eggs and buttermilk and mix together to make a thin batter.\nCarefully pull out the rack with the cast iron skillet and pour the batter into the preheated skillet.\nBake the corn pone until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. If desired, turn the oven to broil for the last few minutes of baking to brown the top.\nRemove the skillet from the oven and shake the pan to loosen the corn pone from the skillet. Serve the corn pone warm from the skillet or turn out onto a plate.",
