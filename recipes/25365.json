Select Dough cycle, and press start.\nWhen cycle is complete, remove dough from machine, punch down, and let rest for 5 minutes.  Roll out on lightly floured board into an approximately 24x10 inch rectangle.\nBrush the dough with 3 tablespoons melted butter, then sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, 1 cup nuts and raisins.  Roll up tightly, jelly roll style from the longer side.  Place on a greased baking sheet, shape into a ring, and seal ends. Mist with warm water, cover with plastic wrap which has also been mist with water, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, beat together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon water; set aside.\nJust before baking, brush dough with egg mixture, sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup walnuts. Bake in preheated for 20 to 25 minutes.  This is a dense ring and if it browns too quickly, just cover with foil and continue to bake.",
