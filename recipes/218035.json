    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the meat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain off excess grease. Mix in the tomato sauce and pasta sauce until thoroughly combined; bring to a simmer.\nRemove the polenta from its package, and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Lay the slices in a single layer in a 9x12-inch baking dish. Top each polenta slice with a tablespoon or two of the chive cottage cheese (use all the cottage cheese). Pour the sauce evenly over the cottage cheese, and sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 20 minutes.",
