    "des": "\"I created this recipe when trying to get my husband to stop eating fast food for breakfast. Crispy on the outside and full of maple walnut flavor on the inside. I make 6 at a time and freeze them -- just pop in the toaster or microwave to reheat. Serve with maple syrup and a sprinkling of walnuts.\"",

Stir until evenly moist. Stir in the milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. Fold in walnuts.\nPour about 1/3 cup batter per waffle into the waffle iron, and cook 5 minutes, until done. Transfer waffles to a baking dish, and place in the preheated oven. Cook 5 minutes, or until crisp.",
