    "des": "\"A creamy garlic sauce and a medley of vegetables served over egg noodles make a superb one dish meal.  Of course if you were looking for something a little more elaborate, a Greek salad, thick slabs of feta cheese, and warm pita bread are wonderful accompaniments.\"",
    "ins": "Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water until al dente.  Drain.\nMeanwhile, mix together tahini, lemon juice, and water until smooth. Add garlic, yogurt, and pepper sauce.\nIn a medium skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Saute red pepper and zucchini in oil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender crisp. Add tahini sauce, and heat through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Do not boil or overcook: this sauce curdles easily. Toss noodles with sauce.",
