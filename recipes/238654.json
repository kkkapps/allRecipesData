    "des": "\"A co-worker couldn't decide on her favorite for her birthday treat, brownies or chocolate chip cookies, so she said I should just pick one.

    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBeat softened butter, light brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a large bowl until creamy. Add 1 egg; beat until light and creamy, about 2 minutes.\nWhisk 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until dough is combined. Stir chocolate chips into dough. Spread dough into the bottom of the prepared baking dish to cover completely.\nStir 1 cup white sugar, melted butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl; add 2 eggs and beat well.

Pour brownie batter over cookie dough and spread to cover completely.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the brookies comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
