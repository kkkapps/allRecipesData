    "des": "\"A sweet and tangy sauce simmers with pork for over an hour. Jalapeno added at the end helps add a little kick. Serve alone or over rice or noodles.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan with a lid over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, green bell pepper, green onions, jalapeno pepper, and garlic until softened, about 10 minutes.\nStir in the pork, cherries, cilantro, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, and onion powder, and mix well. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until the pork is cooked through and no longer pink, and the vegetables and cherries have given up their juices, about 30 minutes.\nRemove the lid, stir in the honey, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer uncovered until the sauce reduces and the pork is tender, about 30 more minutes. The sauce won't be extremely thick.",
