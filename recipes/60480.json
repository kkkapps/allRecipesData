Add angel hair pasta, cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until al dente; drain and toss with 1 tablespoon of olive oil to prevent stickiness.,\nHeat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the garlic for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the asparagus and tomatoes, stirring to coat.  Pour in the broth, and continue cooking uncovered 10 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender, but still bright green.\nPlace the pasta in a large bowl, and toss with the asparagus and tomato mixture. Season with dill and pepper. In a separate bowl, mix the avocados, lime juice, and garlic powder together until blended.\nServe pasta with a dollop of the avocado mixture, and top with shredded cheese.",
