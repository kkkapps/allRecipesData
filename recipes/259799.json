    "des": "\"I made these with leftover quinoa and some vegetables I had in the fridge. Super easy! Great on a multigrain bun with some tomatoes, spinach, and your favorite spread! \n\nMy 2 1/2-year-old said, I love it Mommy! If necessary, while frying, flatten the burgers with the back of your spatula (but don't make them too thin).\"",

Add zucchini, yellow bell pepper, and red bell pepper; saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes more.
