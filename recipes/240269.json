    "des": "\"This sweet punch is chock full of fall spicy taste. An excellent option to hot spiced cider and a natural addition to Thanksgiving celebrations. Or do as I do and have cranberry sauce on hand after Thanksgiving to make a hot punch to sip while decorating the tree or watching a game with friends. An excellent hot drink for a Thermos\u00c2\u00ae for tailgating as well. If hot isn't your thing, serve over ice cubes with a splash of lemon-lime soda. Given to me by a good friend, I've looked all over and haven't found one quite like it.\"",
