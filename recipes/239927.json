    "des": "\"This recipe has been handed down in my family for several generations. The sauce is incredible; so smooth and tasty. Adding even a tiny amount of horseradish makes it even better. If you already have a favorite corned beef recipe, you could still make the sauce to serve with your recipe. The sauce is silky-smooth, absolutely delicious, and makes the whole meal! Serve horseradish on the side, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Place corned beef in a 6-quart Dutch oven or heavy pot and pour in enough water to cover beef by 2 inches. Bring water to a boil, skimming the liquid occasionally to remove fat from top. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover Dutch oven with a lid, and simmer for 2 hours.\nArrange cabbage, potatoes, onions, and carrots around beef and return liquid to a boil. Lower heat to medium-low, cover Dutch oven, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. Transfer beef to a serving platter, reserving 1 1/2 cups cooking liquid. Surround meat with the vegetables.\nMelt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into melted butter until dissolved and bubbling, about 1 minute. Add reserved cooking liquid and vinegar to butter-flour mixture; cook, stirring frequently, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and whisk sour cream and mustard into sauce. Serve sauce alongside corned beef and vegetables.",
