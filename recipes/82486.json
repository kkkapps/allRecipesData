    "des": "\"Fresh tomatoes, herbs, and a touch of wine combine to make a light yet distinctive sauce for sauteed sea scallops with tiny shrimp.  This quick-to-prepare main dish has an agreeable lightness, accompanied by buttered new potatoes and fresh green beans.\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Without crowding, lightly brown scallops in batches. Remove scallops  to individual casseroles or lightly buttered baking shells.\nStir onion and mushrooms into the skillet, and cook until the onion is soft and begins to brown. Stir in garlic, tomatoes, wine, ketchup, salt, tarragon, rosemary, and white pepper. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes. Uncover, and cook until thick, about 3 minutes. Mix in shrimp and vinegar.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSpoon sauce evenly over scallops.\nBake in a preheated oven until sauce bubbles and begins to brown at the edges, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle parsley over tops, and serve.",
