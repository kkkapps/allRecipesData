Lay fish on top. Pour remaining salt mixture on top. Pack down tightly so fish is sealed in salt.\nReduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake fish in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted through the salt and into the fish reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes.\nCool fish for 2 minutes. Crack the salt coffin with a wooden spoon. Peel away the salt and discard. Transfer fish to a serving dish using 2 spatulas.",
