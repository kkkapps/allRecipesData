    "des": "\"Sticky ribs come out tender and delicious with no pre-boiling involved. Just mix up the sauce and bake. Everyone loves them! You can bake right away or prepare ahead and let them marinate in this sauce for a while first.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange ribs in a single layer in a roasting pan.\nStir pineapple, jam, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; pour over ribs.\nBake in the preheated oven, basting every 15 minutes, until ribs are glazed and pull away easily from the bone, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
