    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour one 10 inch bundt pan.\nIn a small bowl, mix flour, salt and baking powder. In another small bowl, mix the chopped nuts and raisins and coat them together with about 1 tablespoon of flour. This is to ensure that the nuts and raisins do not sink to the bottom of the cake while it is baking.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the sugar and the butter or margarine. Add the eggs one at a time and beat for 1-2 minutes at low speed. Stir in the vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and the orange juice alternately to the butter mixture and beat until everything is mixed thoroughly. Mix the nuts and raisins mixture into the batter. Pour the batter into a greased and floured 10 inch bundt pan.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cake cool before slicing and serving.",
