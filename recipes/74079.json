Remove from hot water, cool and peel.\nSlice eggs in half, and remove the yolks. Place the yolks into a medium bowl, and mix with the mustard, Italian dressing, mayonnaise, and pepper. Arrange the egg white halves on a plate, and sprinkle with salt. Spoon the yolk mixture into the egg halves, or use a pastry bag and pipe the filling in for a more professional look. Sprinkle with paprika, and refrigerate until serving.",
