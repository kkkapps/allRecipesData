    "des": "\"This was a recipe from a friend of my mom's and the only strawberry pie I've ever made. There is nothing better than freshly picked strawberries in the summer on this pie.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBake pie crust until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.\nRemove crust from oven and turn oven temperature down to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat cream cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a bowl until smoothly combined.\nPour filling into crust.\nBake until filling is set, about 30 minutes.\nRemove from oven and let cool completely.\nWhisk together 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and strawberry gelatin in a saucepan until smooth; place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring constantly, until the gelatin has dissolved and the glaze has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.\nArrange the sliced strawberries atop the cheese filling.\nPour warm glaze over sliced strawberries. Chill thoroughly in refrigerator before serving.",
