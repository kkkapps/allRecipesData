    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and taco seasoning mix in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add cream cheese, salt, and chili powder to ground beef; mix in black beans and corn. Simmer mixture until heated through, about 5 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta shells in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer shells to a bowl and toss with butter.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nFill pasta shells with ground beef mixture and arrange in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour salsa over stuffed shells and top with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the Monterey Jack cheese. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove foil and top shells with remaining Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese. Continue baking until cheeses are melted, about 15 minutes more. Top pasta with sour cream.",
