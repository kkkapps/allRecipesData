    "des": "\"I created this recipe to use up a bumper crop of zucchini and to get my kids to eat more fruits and veggies without them knowing it.  It is a dense cake reminiscent of carrot cake.  I frequently add in an extra cup of stir-ins.  Raisins, flake coconut, and walnuts or pecans are favorites.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x13 inch pan.\nPlace grated zucchini in a colander and set aside to drain.\nWhisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl until well blended. Beat the eggs, applesauce, oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl until smooth. Fold in the flour mixture, then stir in the zucchini. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.\nBake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Allow to cool completely before cutting.",
