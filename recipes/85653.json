    "ins": "Pour the salt into a blender or food processor. Process until fine, about 90 seconds. This must be done, or all of the salt will settle to the bottom of the shaker. Add the onion powder, garlic powder and jalapeno powder, and just pulse until mixed. Transfer to a shaker, and use it to spice up your favorite foods.",
