    "ins": "Whisk together water, egg and salt in a large bowl until salt has dissolved. Stir in dry potato flakes until incorporated. Stir in 1 tablespoon of chopped chives; season with black pepper and cayenne pepper.\nHeat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Swirl the pan to combine.\nDivide potato mixture into four equal portions and shape into pancakes. Place the pancakes in the pan and reduce heat to medium. Cook until a well-browned crust has formed onto the bottom of the pancakes, about 10 minutes. Flip each pancake and flatten slightly. Cook until other sides are browned, 7 to 8 more minutes.\nTransfer to plate; top each pancake with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle each with 3/4 teaspoon chives.",
