    "des": "\"These bars are so delicious it's hard to have just one. Bars are so expensive now-a-days and the most of the ingredients listed on the package I don't even know how to pronounce, so I decided to come up with my own recipe so I know what kind of ingredients I am feeding my family.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.\nPlace the oats, almonds, walnuts, and soy nuts into a food processor. Pulse until finely ground; pour into a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the brown rice cereal, dry milk, wheat germ, raisins, chocolate chips, flax, cinnamon, and salt; set aside.\nBeat the egg whites until frothy in a small bowl; stir in the canola oil, honey, and vanilla extract and pour into the dry mixture. Stir until evenly moistened and press into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the mixture is hot, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the power bar mixture by lifting the foil out of the pan. Allow to cool slightly; remove the foil and cut into bars while still warm. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store in airtight container, or freeze in plastic snack bags.",
