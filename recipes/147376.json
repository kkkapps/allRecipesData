    "des": "\"Common in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, sofrito is a blend of herbs and vegetables used in Afro-Latin/Caribbean cooking to season rice, bean, and meat dishes. It has no salt, and appeals to those unfamiliar with Caribbean food because of its authentic taste. The ingredient is vegetarian friendly and can be adapted to accommodate vegans. Adapt the ingredient amounts to suit your personal tastes.\"",
