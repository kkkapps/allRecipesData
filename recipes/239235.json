    "ins": "Stir carrots and raisins packet and hot water together in a bowl.\nStir carrot cake mix, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a bowl until batter is well-combined. Stir carrot-raisin-hot water mixture into batter. Add 1/3 cup chopped pecans to batter; stir in enough flour to reach a pancake-batter consistency.\nHeat a griddle over medium-high heat and brush with melted butter. Drop batter by 1/3 cupfuls onto griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes to a wire rack to cool.\nPlace 1 pancake on a plate and top with a layer of cream cheese frosting. Place another pancake on top of the frosting and top with another layer of cream cheese frosting. Top with a final pancake and garnish with 1/4 of the shredded carrot and 1/4 of the toasted pecans. Repeat with remaining pancakes, frosting, carrots, and pecans to create 3 more cakes.",
