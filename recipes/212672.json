Fry the red chile peppers and cumin seeds until the seeds begin to splutter; add the ginger and garlic to the mixture and cook together 1 minute more. Stir the calabash mixture, ground red pepper, sugar, and salt into the mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook another 5 minutes before serving.",
