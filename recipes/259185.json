Season with black pepper.\nSpray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray; place over medium heat. Pour in egg-spinach mixture. Cover with a lid. Cook until top is barely set, about 5 minutes. Place corned beef hash over 1 side of the omelet. Slide onto a plate, using the skillet to fold the other side on top. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over omelet.",
