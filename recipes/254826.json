Drop large spoonfuls of the batter into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until pancake is browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.\nArrange pancakes on a wire rack; let stand until completely cool, about 20 minutes. Wrap each pancake individually in plastic wrap and place in a large resealable plastic bag. Transfer to the freezer.",
