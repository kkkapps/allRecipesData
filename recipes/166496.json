Spread this with cream cheese and you'll never want to do quick bread again! And, no need to mash the bananas...the machine will mash them as it mixes the bread.\"",
    "ins": "Place the milk, butter, bananas, flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and yeast in the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Basic setting; press Start.  If your machine has a Fruit/Nut setting, add the raisins and walnuts at the signal, or around 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.",
