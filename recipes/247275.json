    "des": "\"This easy-to-prepare recipe is a surefire winner for your next party. Perfect for watching the game with friends! I use an offset smoker for this recipe, but indirect heat in a 22 1/2 kettle grill works fine too.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken wings in a large bowl. Pour in olive oil; toss with hands until coated. Coat wings evenly with dry rub.\nLight charcoal and heat smoker to 170 to 200 degrees F (77 to 93 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.\nDrain wood chips and place half of them directly on the charcoal. Spread wings evenly on the cooking grate skin-side down.\nSmoke wings until fragrant, about 1 hour.\nFlip wings. Add remaining wood chips to the charcoal. Continue smoking until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour more.\nServe chicken wings with blue cheese dressing.",
