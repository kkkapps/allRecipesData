Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nBrown the beef and pork in a large skillet over medium heat; drain and set aside.\nMelt the butter in the skillet over medium heat.

Transfer the stuffing to the prepared baking dish; cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes; remove the foil and cook until the top has browned, another 5 to 10 minutes.",
