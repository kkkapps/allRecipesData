    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBlot kale thoroughly dry with paper towels if leaves are damp from washing. Arrange kale pieces onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer and drizzle with olive oil and maple syrup; sprinkle with sea salt.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges of the kale begin to brown slightly and the pieces feel crisp to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. Check often after 10 minutes to prevent burning.",
