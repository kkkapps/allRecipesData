Chop chicken.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 16 muffin cups with cooking spray.\nSplit each biscuit in half and press dough halves into prepared muffin cups, shaping the dough into the bottom and up the sides of each muffin cup.\nMix chicken and with cream of chicken soup, mixed vegetables, and half the Cheddar cheese in a bowl.
