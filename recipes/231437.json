    "des": "\"By far the best chopped chicken liver ever! This is from the recipes used at the famous Grossinger's Resort in the Catskills, NY. Please use real rendered chicken fat; it makes a big difference in the flavor. See the recipe for rendered chicken fat in the footnote of this recipe. Serve with crackers or on lettuce or on a bagel with a tomato slice.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 2 tablespoons chicken fat in a large skillet over medium-low heat and cook onions, stirring often, until browned, about 20 minutes. Transfer onions to a food processor, leaving fat in the skillet. Cook chicken livers in hot skillet until firm, lighter in color, and no longer red in the centers, about 10 minutes.\nPlace livers into food processor with onions and add 2 more tablespoons chicken fat, egg yolks, salt, and black pepper. Process until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.",
