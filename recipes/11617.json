Place on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan.\nSprinkle cereal over the crust, then layer the apples over the cereal. Stir together the 1 cup of white sugar, and the 1and 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and nutmeg; sprinkle over the apple layer. Roll out the other half of the dough and cover everything in the pan.
