    "des": "\"This is a great recipe to bring to a buffet or picnic. This tortellini salad is entirely dependent on the quality of the ingredients so try to get the best quality salami and provolone cheese. This salad is best served at room temperature.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente, rinse under cold water and drain.\nPreheat oven broiler and place halved tomatoes on a sheet pan 6 inches from the broiler. Broil skin side up until the skin is wrinkled and partially blackened.\nPlace the tomatoes in a food processor and add the tomato paste, garlic, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, mustard and honey. Blend until smooth. With the processor running, add the olive oil and vegetable oil in a thin steady stream. Season with salt and pepper.\nIn a large bowl, combine the tortellini, cheese, salami, celery, olives, bell pepper, onion, parsley, rosemary and lemon juice. Gently toss and drizzle with vinaigrette to coat. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Best served at room temperature.",
