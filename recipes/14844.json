    "des": "\"So named because I made this when relatives came into town for my husband's college graduation. This cream cheese and olive mixture makes for  a unique texture; the flavors taste best if allowed to meld overnight.  It is great served with a small, crusty bread. Its a crowd pleaser!\"",
