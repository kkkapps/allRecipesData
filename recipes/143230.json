Check about halfway through, and turn potatoes over for even cooking. Slice each potato in half the long way and cook potatoes another 2 minutes on high power.\nPreheat a grill for medium heat.\nBrush the potato tops with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nCook on prepared grill for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once.",
