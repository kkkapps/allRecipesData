I am always looking for different ways to use the shredded meat that I've vacuum sealed and frozen from those occasional cookouts. This is a tasty and healthy salad that I created, which can be used as a dip with crackers or a spread on bread. Substituting packaged or rotisserie chicken is not recommended.\"",
