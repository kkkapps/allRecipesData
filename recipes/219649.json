Drain well, pat the parsnip pieces dry with paper towels, and set aside.\nMelt butter in a skillet over medium heat, and place the parsnips into the hot butter in an even layer. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper (I use quite a bit). Cook parsnips until lightly golden brown on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side.",
