    "des": "\"Rice is a regular at most dinner tables, so keeping this side dish fresh and exciting can be a challenge. Adding the sweet taste of onions and pan-roasted corn only takes another minute or two, but adds incredible texture and flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the corn and onion and cook for 3 minutes or until browned, stirring occasionally. Add the rice and cook and stir until the rice is lightly browned.\nStir the garlic and broth in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 25 minutes or until the rice is tender. Season to taste.",
