    "ins": "In a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until  pale yellow. Whisk in corn starch. Set aside.\nIn a stainless steel saucepan, bring milk and vanilla bean to a boil, remove from heat and remove vanilla bean.  Stir a small amount of the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture. Return milk to heat and while constantly stirring with a wooden spoon, slowly add the egg mixture to milk. Mixture will thicken.\nAllow to just come to a boil, remove from heat and stir in butter. Put  mixture through a sieve into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap (this keeps mixture from forming a skin over top). Cool slightly.\nStir in melted white chocolate, cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble pie. This pastry cream is used in the Elegant White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie.",
