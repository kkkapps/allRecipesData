    "des": "\"Not a high riser but a simple cake and easy to make. Pumpkin pie spice can be substituted for the mixed spice in this recipe.  If you can't find self-rising flour, substitute 1 cup all-purpose flour + 1 teaspoon baking powder + 1/2 teaspoon salt for each cup of self-rising flour.\"",

Stir over medium heat until the butter is melted and sugar is dissolved.  Bring mixture to a boil, then simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool slightly until lukewarm.  Stir in baking soda.\nSift flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center.  Pour the fruit mixture into the flour, and mix together until blended.\nPour batter into prepared pan, smoothing surface with the back of a spoon. Bake in the preheated oven for 75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
