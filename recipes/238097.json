    "des": "\"One of my favorite side dishes, as it's very easy to make! I personally love garlic so I go crazy with it, but put as much as is good for you. This is a very simple recipe and you can put as much or as little of the seasonings you want.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut the bottom off of the cabbage and set it so that the flat end is on the cutting board; cut into 1-inch thick slices. Arrange slices in a single layer in a large casserole dish.\nDrizzle olive oil over the cabbage slices and top with garlic. Season cabbage with salt and pepper. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven until the cabbage core is easily pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes.",
