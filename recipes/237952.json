    "des": "\"I ate this at a sports bar/cafe on the big island of Hawaii. This is a local dish served many ways, but this version is my favorite. They usually make it with SPAM\u00c2\u00ae. Also you can make this using leftover rice, pre-cooked burgers, and jarred sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.\nDivide ground chuck into 4 equal portions; form into patties.\nFry patties in skillet until beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove patties to a plate, retaining drippings in the skillet.\nStir onion and water into the reserved drippings. Reduce heat to low and cook until the onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms into the onion mixture; cook until mushrooms are cooked through, about 5 minutes more.\nPour gravy over the onion and mushroom mixture; stir. Cook until the gravy is hot, about 5 minutes. Gently lie patties into the gravy; simmer until reheated through.\nWhile the patties simmer in gravy, prepare a separate skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Fry eggs in the hot skillet until the white is opaque but the yolk remains runny, 2 to 3 minutes.\nDivide rice between 4 plates. Top each rice portion with a beef patty and top the patties each with an egg. Pour gravy equally over each portion.",
