I've changed the ingredients just a bit, but since then it's been among our family's favorite. Now our daughter Jenny prepares it for her family.\"",
    "ins": "In a large deep skillet, combine the cold water, onion, and gingersnap cookies. Stir gently until the cookies have dissolved. Add the vinegar and sliced frankfurters. Heat over medium-low heat until simmering and somewhat thick. Serve over hot mashed potatoes.",
