    "des": "\"I concocted this when I was trying to liven up an egg white frittata. It turned out deceptively decadent. The sun-dried tomatoes make all the difference.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round pan.\nPlace sun-dried tomatoes into a bowl of warm water until rehydrated, about 10 minutes. Drain and chop.\nHeat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add spinach; cook and stir until thawed and water is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta cheese until well mixed.\nWhisk egg whites, skim milk, salt, pepper, and basil together in a bowl until very frothy. Carefully stir spinach mixture and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese into egg mixture. Pour into the prepared pan; top with remaining Parmesan cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until frittata is set and browned on top, about 25 minutes.",
