    "des": "\"One of my family's favorite meals! We vary the toppings by sometimes using cabbage slaw and other times broccoli slaw. Super healthy and low in fat! We've also substituted iceberg lettuce leaves for the buns to lower the calories. Messier but so yummy! Serve any extra slaw on the side. You can serve these over rice or on a bed of salad, too. We've also turned them into lettuce wraps to save more calories!\"",
