    "des": "\"This is an excellent creme brulee with a slightly tart kick. Serve with fresh fruit slices (orange or kiwi suggested) and whipped cream, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nBring orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice to a boil in a saucepan; cook until reduced to about 2 tablespoons liquid, 8 to 10 minutes.\nHeat cream and 1/3 cup sugar together in a separate saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar completely dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes; remove from heat.\nWhisk egg yolks together in a bowl until frothy. Whisk reduced juice mixture into egg yolks until fully combined. Pour cream mixture in gradually, whisking constantly, until thin custard forms.\nStrain custard mixture through a fine sieve; divide into six 5-ounce ramekins. Place ramekins in a baking dish; pour in enough boiling water to come half way up the sides of ramekins.\nBake in preheated oven until just set, about 1 hour. Remove from oven, cool slightly, and cover ramekins with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 4 hours.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nRemove plastic wrap from ramekins. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar in a thin layer over top of each ramekin. Brown sugar under a broiler until golden and caramelized, 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
