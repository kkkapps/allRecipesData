    "ins": "Spread the olive oil on the inside of a slow cooker.  Place the venison roast inside, and cover with apple, onions, and garlic.  Turn to Low, and cook until the roast is tender, about 6 to 8 hours.\nWhen the roast has cooked, remove it from the slow cooker, and place onto a serving platter.  Discard the apple.  Stir the water and bouillon into the slow cooker until the bouillon has dissolved.  Serve this as a sauce with the roast.",
