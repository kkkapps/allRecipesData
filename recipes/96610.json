    "des": "\"My Mom has been making this creamy eggnog for everyone for at least 25 years, and more people ask for it each year. It uses three types of liquor--you do not need the best brands,  but do not buy the cheapest either. Note that raw eggs are 'cooked' by the alcohol. Once made, keep the eggnog refrigerated and use within a week, stirring gently before serving to re-incorporate the egg whites that rise to the surface.\"",
    "ins": "Beat the eggs and sugar together in a very large bowl until thick and light-colored. Stir in the bourbon and rum, mixing until sugar has dissolved. Let stand about 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, whip the egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form.\nStir the whipping cream and half and half into the egg yolk mixture until thoroughly blended. Slowly stir in the brandy. Fold in the egg whites, blending evenly. Cover and refrigerate two hours before serving. May be stored in the refrigerator up to one week.\nServe in small cups or glasses dusted with a pinch of nutmeg.",
