    "des": "\"A cookie that is full bodied with flavor.  My granddaughter and daughter's worksite request these as: \"We need some of 'Grandma's cookies'\".\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl.\nBeat butter, sugars and vanilla in a huge bowl.  Beat eggs WELL and add to flour mixture.  Mix flour mixture into butter mixture and stir well.\nAdd the semi-sweet chocolate pieces and walnuts.  Mix well.\nDrop by rounded tablespoons on ungreased baking sheets.  (I lightly push about  4-6 plain  M and M's on top of each cookie for flavor and color.)\nBake for 11 minutes.  Don't overbake or they get hard.  Let cool on wire racks.  Enjoy!",
