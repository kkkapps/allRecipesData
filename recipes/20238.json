    "des": "\"This sounds absurdly simple but is wonderful, especially when really great Italian meats and cheeses are used; but it really jazzes up routine lunch meats on a sub, too.  I highly recommend the addition of a good dollop of Holland House hot cherry pepper relish.  It's heavenly - had it at a sub shop on Boylston Street in Boston in the 70's and dreamed about it for years.  Finally discovered it at an Italian grocery in Seattle and was thrilled to discover that same fabulous flavor.  Try it, you'll love it!\"",
    "ins": "Combine all ingredients in a jar, and let sit for at least an hour to steep the flavors in the oil.  Sprinkle generously on the lettuce in your sub or directly on the insides of the bun.",
