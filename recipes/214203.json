    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat; cook the sausage, onions, bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the water, cabbage, carrots, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, beef bouillon cubes, seasoned salt, thyme, and cayenne pepper to the stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the stockpot, and cook the soup at a simmer for 45 minutes. Stir the zucchini and beans into the soup; cook another 10 minutes.\nBring a large pot with lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles in boiling water until cooked yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and stir into the soup. Ladle the soup into bowls, and top with Parmesan cheese to serve.",
