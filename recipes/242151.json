    "des": "\"This is a wonderful, slightly creamy egg dish. The chopped parsley gives it tons of great color! If you can't find creme fraiche in your grocery store, just combine 1 tablespoon of buttermilk with 1 cup heavy whipping cream. Stir together and pour into a jar. Very lightly screw the lid on and let sit for 5 to 8 hours. This it can be refrigerated for 10 to 14 days.\"",

Fold in parsley, black pepper, salt, and white pepper.\nMelt butter and olive oil together in a nonstick skillet over medium heat; reduce heat to low. Cook and stir egg mixture in hot butter and oil until eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Stir in 1 tablespoon creme fraiche; cook and stir until eggs are set, 2 to 3 minutes more.
