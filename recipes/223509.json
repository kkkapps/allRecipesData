    "des": "\"A friend gave me her recipe and I reduced it to feed 4 instead of an army and tweaked it to our tastes. This is a wonderful cold soup bursting with garden freshness in every bite. Adjust the ingredients to suit your tastes or to use the bounty in your garden. And it doesn't heat up the kitchen on those hot summer days! Garnish with fresh parsley, chives, dollops of sour cream, and toast. Chill at least 1 hour; it is better the next day.\"",
