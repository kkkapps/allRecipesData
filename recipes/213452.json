    "des": "\"Through trial, error and what I had in the house, I developed this easy glaze to make a yummy fresh strawberry pie -- almost easier than opening a container. Serve with sweetened whipped cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBake the pie crust in the preheated oven until puffed and golden-brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and cool completely.\nPuree 1 cup of strawberries in a blender until smooth. Pour pureed strawberries into a saucepan. Stir in the water, sugar, and cornstarch. Bring to a boil over medium heat until thickened, stirring often. Remove from heat and stir in the orange liqueur. Set aside.\nArrange the remaining 3 cups of strawberries decoratively in the prepared pie crust. Pour the glaze over the berries. Refrigerate until glaze is set, about 4 hours.",
