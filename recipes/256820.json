    "des": "\"Not quite a tortilla soup, not quite a taco soup, this comes together fast and gets better overnight. Stores like a dream and has fabulous flavor. Serve with sour cream and cheese on top, with either tortilla chips or cornbread on the side. Or if you're feeling fancy, you could make some paninis with pepper Jack cheese, roasted red peppers, avocados, tomatoes and mushrooms. Very tasty!\"",

Add whole chicken breasts.\nCook on Low until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 5 to 6 hours. Remove chicken and shred using 2 forks; stir back into the slow cooker. Continue cooking, 1 to 2 hours more.\nStir cilantro into the slow cooker. Cook on Low until flavors combine, about 15 minutes.",
