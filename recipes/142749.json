Slice pork loin into six thin, wide pieces and lay onto a baking sheet.\nLay a slice of bacon and a slice of dill pickle on one side of each pork loin slice. Divide the mustard and sauerkraut among the pork loin slices.  Season with salt and pepper; roll up each slice tightly and secure with toothpicks.  Dip each roulade in the beaten egg and then roll in bread crumbs.\nMelt the butter in a skillet over medium heat; drizzle in the olive oil. Cook each roulade until they are golden brown, and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes per side. Remove toothpicks before serving.",
