    "des": "\"This is such an easy recipe to throw together with a few ingredients. It always gets rave reviews. The recipe uses peanut butter, but you can substitute any nut butter or sunflower seed butter. A favorite of mine is to use hazelnut butter. Slice into triangles and top with some whipped cream (I use chilled coconut milk) and orange zest.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the chocolate chips with the peanut butter and maple syrup in a double boiler over medium heat, stirring continually until smooth. Pour into a dish lined with parchment paper; refrigerate 6 hours to overnight before cutting to serve.",
