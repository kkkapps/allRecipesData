Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.\nStir kale, sour cream, and Parmesan cheese into the soup; cook until the kale wilts, about 5 minutes.
