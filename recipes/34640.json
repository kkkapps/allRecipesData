    "des": "\"This recipe is a result of my intro to conch while spending several years sailing off the coast of Florida and in the Caribbean. Hope you enjoy. Serve immediately over white rice or fine noodles along with a green veggie such as peas or whole green beans and warm French baguettes. White wine really sets it off. Note: The sauce may be prepared ahead and refrigerated 3-4 days or frozen until ready to use. Simply reheat, add conch, and serve.\"",
    "ins": "Pound the conch meat with a mallet until tender. Chop into bite-size pieces. Place in a bowl, sprinkle with lemon juice, and set aside.\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the garlic, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, and mushrooms until tender. Mix in the tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and sugar. Season with red pepper, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nMix the conch meat into the skillet, and continue to cook 10 minutes. Do not overcook, or the conch will become tough.",
