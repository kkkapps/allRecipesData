    "des": "\"This is an easy, elegant, wonderful salmon dish with a no-cook sauce. It really doesn't get much easier. I love it best on swelteringly hot summer days. Fresh steamed asparagus goes very well with this, and the sauce tastes good on it as well.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, blend the plain yogurt, Dijon mustard, honey, lemon juice, and dill. Cover, and refrigerate until serving.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the salmon in the white wine and water. Adjust the amount of water as necessary to just cover the fish. Sprinkle with shallots. Cover the saucepan, and cook 10 to 12 minutes, until salmon is easily flaked with a fork. Drain, and serve with the yogurt sauce.",
