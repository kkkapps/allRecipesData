    "des": "\"This is probably one of the best scone recipes I've made. The texture is nice and the taste is excellent. They have just a hint of eggnog, so even those who aren't big fans of the drink will like them.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nStir the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl until blended. Cut in the butter using a pastry cutter or two knives until coarse crumbs form. Mix in the craisins. Use a fork to stir in the eggnog and make a sticky dough.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface; dip hands in flour and knead the dough about 10 times. Pat the dough out into a disk about 1/2 inch thick. Dip a 2 inch diameter biscuit cutter into some flour, and cut out 8 to 10 rounds.  Place rounds about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Use up remaining dough by patting it into a smaller disk and cutting again.\nBake in preheated oven until risen and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
