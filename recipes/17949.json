    "des": "\"Easy to make, these ribs are delicious served either hot or at room temperature. So this is a great recipe for a casual dinner party that you can make ahead. The sauce is great served over rice.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSlice the ribs into individual pieces. In a large bowl, combine the honey, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and brown sugar. Stir until honey and sugar are completely dissolved, then stir in the baking soda. The mixture will begin to foam. Transfer ribs to the bowl, and turn to coat.\nCover a cookie sheet with foil, and arrange the ribs meat side up on the sheet. Pour excess sauce over all, and sprinkle with the garlic salt.\nBake for 1 hour, turning every 20 minutes.",
