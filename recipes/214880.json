    "des": "\"My father and his Chinese 'brother's' recipe for the best deep fried shrimp, now famous in our town. If you have leftover bacon, don't worry; you can deep fry it and that's for you! For a sauce, ketchup and horseradish work great but these are great by them self!\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut the shrimp along the back, nearly through to the front. Stuff each shrimp with a sliver of jalapeno, then wrap with half a slice of bacon. Secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.\nCook the shrimp in batches in the hot oil until the bacon is crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.",
