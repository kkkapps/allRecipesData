Rinse the trout and pat dry. Lay the fish in the center of the foil about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle with white wine, melted butter and lemon juice. Season with parsley, salt and pepper. Fold the foil up loosely around the fish and crimp the seams to seal.\nPlace the packet on the grill and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until fish is cooked through.",
