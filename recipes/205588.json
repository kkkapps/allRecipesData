    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the okra, sausage, Cajun seasoning, and salt. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.  Stir in the shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 8 to 12 minutes.",
