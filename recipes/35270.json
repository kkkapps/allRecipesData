    "des": "\"A different and delicious way to enjoy chicken livers. To make this dish healthier, I like to use yolkless noodles.  I have made this for many of my friends over the past 20 years, and have always received rave reviews, even from some who thought that they would not like chicken livers.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, and set aside.\nWhile the noodles are getting started, heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Add onions, and cook, stirring until tender, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms, and continue cooking for a few minutes, until starting to brown. Add the chicken livers, and season with paprika, salt and pepper. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until livers are nicely browned on the outside, but still slightly pink in the center. Do not over cook - the livers will become tough and leathery.\nRemove the skillet from the heat, and gradually whisk in the sherry, then the sour cream until well blended. Serve over hot egg noodles.",
