    "des": "\"This amazing cake joined the Walker family traditions when my brother met my sister-in-law. She's a redhead with lots of freckles, and this cake, thanks to the chocolate shavings and chips, has lots of freckles too. So, we changed the name. Chocolate Chip Cake (boring!) is now Freckle Cake. Great topped with vanilla ice cream!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)).\nBeat yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, eggs, vegetable oil, and water in a bowl with an electric mixer to make a smooth batter, about 2 minutes. Stir grated chocolate and chocolate chips into batter and pour into prepared tube pan.\nBake until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan before turning out onto a cake plate.",
