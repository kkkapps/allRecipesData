    "des": "\"My little cousin, Eric, inspired me to come up with this dip. His favorite food is cheeseburgers, and since I couldn't make cheeseburgers for his family party, I turned his fave dish into a easy-to-make dip! It's a simple recipe that can be expanded on with a variety of ingredients. Serve dip with tortilla chips (scoop-style chips are easiest), potato chips, or thin slices of baguette bread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sweet onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Break ground beef into the skillet; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes more.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Stir chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper into the beef mixture. Pour cheese spread into the skillet; cook and stir until the cheese spread is melted evenly through the beef mixture, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer beef mixture to a serving dish.\nLayer lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles atop the beef mixture to serve.",
