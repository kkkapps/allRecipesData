    "des": "\"I learned to make this when I was vacationing in Bermuda after high school. It has been 18 years, and this is still one of our favorite dishes ever! My children ALL love it - from the toddler to the teen! And it's so easy that even my non-cooking husband can whip this up! The longer you marinate the chicken, the better it is!\"",
    "ins": "Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry with paper towels. Stir together the lemon juice, soy sauce, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl; pour into a large, resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken breasts, seal the bag, and massage to evenly coat chicken with lemon juice mixture. Place in refrigerator to marinate at least 20 minutes, or up to 24 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grill grate, and place about 4 inches from heat source.\nDrain and discard marinade from the bag, and place chicken on preheated grill. Cook until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes on each side.",
