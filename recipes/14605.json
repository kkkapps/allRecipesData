    "des": "\"This is a wonderful way to do rump roast in the slow cooker. It creates a wonderful juice while it cooks; serve the juice over individual servings of beef. You'll want the cut to be between 4 and 5 pounds.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, mix together black pepper, paprika, chili powder, celery salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and mustard powder. Rub mixture over the surface of the meat. Place roast in a slow cooker, and add 1/2 cup water.\nCover, and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours. When meat is tender and well done, transfer roast to a serving platter.
