Add eggs,  melted semi-sweet baking chocolate, and cranberry sauce.\nCombine the mixtures together and stir until well blended.\nPour into a 9x13 inch baking pan. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)  for 30 to 35 minutes, or until knife inserted into center comes out clean. Cool at least 10 minutes before serving, excellent served slightly warm.\nGarnish by sifting powdered sugar onto a paper doily or just dollop spoonfuls of whole berry cranberry sauce on top of each serving of cake.\nThis cake can also be baked in 2 - 8 inch round layer cake pans, baking time is decreased to 20 to 25 minutes or until knife inserted comes out clean. Another can of whole berry cranberry sauce can be spread generously between and on top of the unfrosted layered cake rounds for an impressive look during the holidays!",
