    "des": "\"I had oranges and apples in the house and couldn't find a recipe that used them both so I created this one. This is a great side-dish for a holiday gathering or would even be good as a dessert over French vanilla ice cream -- or even better if you cook this the night before and heat it up before serving. Enjoy!\"",

Sprinkle crushed crackers evenly over the fruit.\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk in flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and baking powder. Drizzle over the crackers, then drizzle the creamer over the casserole. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven and uncover. Stir gently to fold in the crust.",
