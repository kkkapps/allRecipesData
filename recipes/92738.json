    "des": "\"This is a traditional Greek recipe. When I first heard of it, I was very reluctant to try something so strange. After tasting it, it turned into one of the family's favorite desserts. And it is very easy to make! Sprinkle with a little extra cinnamon before serving if you wish.\"",
    "ins": "Place the flour in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden. Set aside to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, stir together the watermelon, flour, honey, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Grease a 9 or 10 inch pie plate, and sprinkle half of the sesame seeds over the bottom. Pour the watermelon filling over the seeds, the filling should be about 1 inch thick. Sprinkle the remaining sesame seeds over the top.\nBake for 40 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before slicing. Refrigerate leftovers.",
