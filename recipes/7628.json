    "ins": "Place raisins and currants in a bowl, and add enough water to just cover them.  Soak overnight.\nChop orange and lemon peel quite fine; do the same with the citron, angelica, and both types of cherries.  Pour 1/2 cup brandy over fruit, and allow to stand overnight.\nSift together flour, mace, and nutmeg.\nBeat egg yolks until thick and light, then beat in 1 cup of sugar a little at a time.  Stir in lemon juice.  Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form.\nIn a large bowl, cream the butter, and then add 1 cup sugar a little at a time; beat until smooth.  Combine yolk mixture with creamed mixture.  Add flour and 1/3 cup sherry alternately to the creamed mixture.  Stir in all the fruit, and fold in stiffly beaten egg whites.  Pour batter into a well greased and floured 10 inch mold or tube pan. This cake can also be made in 2 large loaf pans.\nPlace a pan of hot water in the bottom of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven.  Place cake pans in oven, and bake about 20 minutes.  Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C); continue baking 100 minutes for large cake, or 40 minutes for loaf cakes.  Cakes are done when a toothpick comes out dry. Turn cake(s) out on rack to cool.\nWrap cake(s) in cheesecloth soaked in sherry, and store in airtight container for a month or more.  If the cheesecloth dries out in the mellowing period soak it again with the same spirits, and rewrap the cake.",
