    "des": "\"Deep, dark, satisfying, and seriously addictive. They are best when cooled down to firm up the chocolate chips inside to give a burst of flavor. Our co-op grocer sells stevia-sweetened dark chocolate chips which are very good. Freeze some cupcakes for a fast snack on the go.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin pans with paper liners.\nCombine gluten-free flour, coconut sugar, dark chocolate chips, cocoa powder, coconut flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt in a bowl; mix well to combine.\nWhisk buttermilk, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in another large bowl until combined. Add flour mixture; fold in with a spatula until completely blended. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups, filling each about halfway.\nBake cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pans 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
