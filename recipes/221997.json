    "des": "\"There are two ways you can do this recipe. You can boil your beans, dress them and serve immediately. I prefer it dressed and left to marinate in the fridge overnight, which gives you something closer to a pickled bean.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add beans and cook uncovered until nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well, and set aside in a large bowl.\nSmash garlic, olive oil, mint, and salt using mortar and pestle.\nPour vinegar and half of olive oil mixture over beans and toss well.\nTransfer beans to a resealable freezer bag. Pour remaining olive oil mixture into bag, squeeze out all air, seal and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours.\nRemove beans from refrigerator, top with fresh mint and serve.",
