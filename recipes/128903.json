    "des": "\"This is an original recipe for those who like trying something a little different. Using cranberries, walnuts, and golden raisins, you can make a stuffing that sweetens your Thanksgiving meal! I'm not actually sure how well it does when baked in a turkey. I find that putting stuffing in the bird tends to dry the bird.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.\nCombine the bread, cranberries, raisins, and walnuts in a large bowl. Whisk together the brown sugar and butter in a separate bowl; season with cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt; stir into the bread cubes until evenly distributed. Spread the mixture into the prepared dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until crisp on top, 45 to 60 minutes.",
