    "des": "\"Firstly, this name came from the fact that it is easy to modify from a weekly recipe to a weekend recipe and because I give a name to everything I create and  that my family likes. If they didn't like it, it would have been chicken A La Please-Mom-Never-Again!!!! Serve with a bechamel sauce.  For the weekend version, replace the vegetables with baby shrimp and long strips of green onion, brown, and wrap in puff pastry.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace chicken breasts between two sheets of wax paper or plastic wrapping, and pound with a meat mallet to flatten.\nCover each flattened breast with a slice or two of ham. Place 2 tablespoons cheese and a bit of carrot and a zucchini on the end of each chicken breast. Roll up each breast, and fasten with toothpicks.\nIn a large skillet, heat a small amount of oil over medium high heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes to lightly brown. Place browned rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.",
