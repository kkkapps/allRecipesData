Mix remaining lemon juice, tomatoes, chives, chile pepper, sugar, and salt together in a separate bowl.\nHeat a large skillet to smoking hot over medium-high heat. Cook snapper until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute per side.\nPlace snapper on preheated grill; brush with soy mixture on each side. Grill, basting occasionally with soy mixture, until snapper flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 6 minutes per side.\nTransfer snapper to serving platter. Pour tomato mixture over snapper to serve.",
