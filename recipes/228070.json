    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat. If using charcoal, push coals to the side of the grilling area for indirect heat.\nPour stout beer into an empty 12-ounce soda can and drop Thai chilies and garlic cloves into the can. Mix brown sugar, dry mustard, garam masala, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, cumin, cinnamon, onion powder, garlic powder, and nutmeg in a bowl.\nRinse the chicken and coat the skin with the entire batch of spice rub. Place soda can containing beer mixture onto the prepared grill and sit the chicken upright onto the can.\nGrill chicken over indirect heat until juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast, not touching bone, reads at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Let chicken rest 10 minutes before serving.",
