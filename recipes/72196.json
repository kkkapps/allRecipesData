    "des": "\"Delicious raspberry-flavored margarita. This recipe is inspired by one of the big chains that is famous for its margaritas!  You'll love this!  Be sure to use top-quality tequila and raspberry liqueur for maximum effect. I sometimes like to add a 'floater' of Chambord to top it all off.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the sweet and sour mix, tequila, cointreau, and raspberry liqueur into a shaker filled with ice. Shake until the shaker is frosty on the outside. Rub the rim of a margarita glass with a lime wedge, then dip in salt. Add a few ice cubes to the glass, then strain the liquid from the shaker carefully into the glass. Garnish with a lime wedge.",
