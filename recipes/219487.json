Refrigerate the dressing while preparing the salad.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpread the broken ramen noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds onto a baking sheet.\nBake the ramen noodle mixture until lightly browned, about 15 minutes, stirring often.

Allow mixture to cool.\nJust before serving, mix together the napa cabbage and green onions with toasted ramen mixture in a salad bowl until thoroughly combined; toss with the dressing.",
