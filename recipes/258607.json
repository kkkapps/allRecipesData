    "des": "\"Homemade pea soup is less than 30 minutes away, with canned sweet peas, bagged spinach and chicken broth as time savers.  Blending early in the preparation so the soup purees all at once in only one batch, keeps it simple too.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook onion about 10 minutes or until lightly browned and soft, stirring frequently.\nBlend onion, peas, spinach, lemon juice, thyme and 2 cups chicken broth in a blender or food processor until very smooth. Return to same saucepan. Stir in remaining broth. Gently heat about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nStir in cream, if desired. Heat over low heat about 1 minute.  DO NOT BOIL. Garnish with garlic croutons, if desired.",
