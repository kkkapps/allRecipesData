    "des": "\"This is a fabulous recipe for holidays or when company comes over.  Even people who don't like Brussels sprouts will love them prepared this way!  Make the dish ahead of time and pop it in the oven just before dinner.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCut an X in the stem end of the Brussels sprouts.  Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add Brussels sprouts and cook until tender, about 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and place in a shallow baking dish.\nMeanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon of grease, and set aside.\nSaute onion in reserved bacon grease, until limp.  Stir in flour and cook until bubbly.  Remove from heat and whisk in milk.  Return to heat and cook, stirring, until the mixture boils and thickens.  Stir in wine, salt, oregano, dill, pepper, and all but 2 tablespoons of bacon.  Pour mixture evenly over the Brussels sprouts and sprinkle with remaining bacon.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until heated through.",
