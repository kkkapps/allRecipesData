    "des": "\"A great dinner for two! Chicken breasts marinated in oil, vinegar and Ranch-style dressing, then broiled to a beguiling finish. This is a wonderful chicken recipe that can be prepared in the morning and cooked when you get home at night. The longer you let it marinate, the better it tastes!\"",
    "ins": "Combine the dressing mix, oil and vinegar in a large, resealable plastic bag and mix together. Add chicken to bag, seal and shake to coat; work mixture into the meat.\nRefrigerate to marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight if possible.\nPreheat oven to Broil/Grill.\nRemove chicken from bag, discarding any remaining marinade, and broil for 10 to 15 minutes or until cooked through and no longer pink inside.",
