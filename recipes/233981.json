    "des": "\"This is a great and healthy snack for kids to make on their own. It can also be used for breakfast or dessert. Kids like to eat what they make, so this is a great way to get their dairy and fruit into them for the day or after school. Use any fruit and any flavor of yogurt and granola for this recipe. The possibilities are endless!\"",
