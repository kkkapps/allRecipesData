    "des": "\"I learned how to make lasagna this way when I worked in France. What makes it French-style is the use of a bechamel (white sauce) instead of ricotta, and Swiss (traditionally Emmental) cheese. Full of great flavor! I always get compliments.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine ground beef, onion, green bell pepper, and minced garlic in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is no longer pink, 5 to 8 minutes.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in flour; cook for 1 minute. Pour in milk and heavy cream. Cook, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.\nSpread 1/4 of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 lasagna noodles. Spoon 1/3 of the beef mixture over the noodles. Spread 1/4 of the tomato sauce and 1/3 of the white sauce over the beef mixture. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, herbes de Provence, and garlic powder on top. Cover with 1/3 of the Swiss cheese and mozzarella cheese.\nRepeat layers twice, starting with noodles and ending with cheeses.\nBake lasagna in the preheated oven until top is deeply browned, 30 to 45 minutes.",
