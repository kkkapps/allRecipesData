    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nJuice the orange into a measuring cup; add enough water to reach 8 ounces. Stir in chia seeds and molasses. Set wet mixture aside until gelled, about 10 minutes.\nPlace flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cream of tartar, baking soda, nutmeg, allspice, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until just combined, about 30 seconds. Cut chilled coconut oil into 8 pieces; add to flour mixture and pulse until mixture resembles wet sand, about 30 seconds.\nPour wet mixture into food processor and pulse briefly until the dough starts to stick together, about 1 minute. Scrape dough into large bowl. Add pecans and knead 5 or 6 turns to distribute them in the dough.\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured surface; cut into 2 equal portions. Pat or roll each portion into a 1-inch thick round. Cut into 8 wedge-shape pieces and place on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until the tops of the scones are firm and edges look dry, about 20 minutes.",
