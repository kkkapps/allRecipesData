    "des": "\"This dish is served hot, and is the best bean salad I've ever had. I make it with black beans, kidney beans, green beans, wax beans, and garbanzo beans. You may not like one or more of the types of beans listed above - just substitute your favorites. This dish is especially good for taking to potluck suppers.\"",
    "ins": "Cut bacon into small pieces using kitchen shears, and place in a large skillet.  Cook, turning frequently, over medium high heat until evenly browned. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup drippings. Set bacon aside.\nReturn reserved drippings to skillet.  Mix together sugar, cornstarch, and salt and pepper; blend into drippings.  Stir in vinegar and water; cook and stir until boiling.  Stir in drained beans.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally.\nTurn bean mixture into serving dish.  Crumble bacon over beans.",
