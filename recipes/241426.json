    "des": "\"This easy dish was inspired by an appetizer I enjoyed once at a Lebanese restaurant in Atlanta. The simple combination of peppery radishes, toasted walnuts, and fresh mint is satisfying and somehow greater than the sum of its parts. It is prettiest when served immediately and tastes great with roasted meats and hearty grain salads. If you have leftovers, try tucking them into toasted pitas with a little goat cheese or feta.\"",
    "ins": "Toast walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant and a shade darker, 2 to 4 minutes. Chop coarsely.\nPlace radishes in a serving bowl.\nWhisk oil, lemon juice, salt, and honey in a small bowl until combined; drizzle over radish slices and toss to coat.\nStack mint leaves, roll tightly, and slice crosswise into thin ribbons. Fold mint and walnuts into salad.",
