    "ins": "Place pork butt in a slow cooker with the fattier side facing upwards. Pour water and orange juice into the slow cooker. Season pork and liquid with salt and pepper.\nMix garlic and mustard together in a small bowl; spread over the top of the pork butt. Sprinkle onion over the pork.\nCook on Low, turning the butt a few times, until the meat falls apart easily when pulled with a fork, 6 to 8 hours.\nRemove pork from slow cooker; allow to sit until cool enough to handle. Trim away and discard any visible chunks of fat. Shred remaining pork into strands. Return shredded pork to the slow cooker; stir. Remove portions of pork from slow cooker with a slotted spoon to serve.",
