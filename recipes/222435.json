    "des": "\"The sauce was created in Ulster County, New York. The sauce turns a ordinary hot dog into a mouth-watering meal. The hot dog is served on a steamed bun with mustard, chopped onions and then the sauce. Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Grind hot dogs into a chunky paste in a food processor and place into a large saucepan. Mix cornstarch with 1 cup water in a small bowl and set aside. Pour 7 more cups water over the hot dogs. Stir in vinegar, paprika, chili powder, sea salt, red pepper flakes, oregano, onion powder, cinnamon, white pepper, and black pepper and bring to a boil.\nSimmer over low heat until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 30 minutes. Gradually stir in reserved cornstarch mixture and simmer for 15 more minutes. Adjust salt and black pepper. Sauce will be thinner than chili and will thicken as it cools.",
