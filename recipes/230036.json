    "des": "\"When I lived in New Zealand, there was an abundance of kumara (their version of our sweet potato) and it was used in everything from curries to muffins. I came up with this recipe to fuse those two ideas, but mainly to appeal to my then 2-year-old, a picky eater who loved finger foods. I serve it with fruit for a complete meal.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with butter. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nPlace sweet potato and bacon on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; flip sweet potato and bacon. Bake until sweet potato is tender and bacon is crisp, about 20 more minutes. Let bacon cool on paper towels.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, curry powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in Cheddar cheese until coated.\nPeel sweet potato and transfer to a bowl; roughly mash. Measure out 1 cup of mashed sweet potato. Chop bacon and stir into onion.\nWhisk eggs vigorously in a separate bowl. Add milk, sour cream, and butter; whisk until smooth. Fold in 1 cup sweet potato, bacon, and onions. Gently stir the sweet potato mixture into the flour mixture, using a rubber spatula, until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared muffin tin.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool muffins in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
