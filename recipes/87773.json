    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake the corn dogs according to package directions.\nWhen corn dogs are cool enough to handle, remove the sticks, and split in half lengthwise. Remove the hot dog part, leaving the cornbread shell intact. Chop the hot dogs into small pieces, and place in a medium bowl. Mix in the mashed potatoes. Fill each corn shell with an equal amount of the potato mixture. Sprinkle cheese over the top.\nReturn to the oven, and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.",
