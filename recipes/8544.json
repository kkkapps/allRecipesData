Drain, and reserve broth.\nIn a microwave-safe dish, mix together sour cream, parmesan cheese, white wine, chicken broth, salt and lemon pepper.\nCut chicken into bite size pieces, and put in sauce mixture.  Cover.  Microwave on High for about 10 to 15 minutes, then on  Low for another 5 minutes.  Make sure it doesn't burn.  When sauce starts to thicken and chicken is tender, it is done!",
