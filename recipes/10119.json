    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).\nIn a bowl, combine food coloring with a few drops of water.  Add coconut and cover the container, shake until coconut is tinted.  Set aside.\nPlace 1/2 of the vanilla wafers, flat side up, in an ungreased cookie sheet.  Top each wafer with a peppermint patty.  Place in the oven about 1 minute or just until chocolate begins to soften.\nRemove cookies from oven and sprinkle each mint with 1/2 teaspoon coconut (for lettuce).  Place another vanilla wafer on top and press gentle.  With a clean paint brush, brush the top of each hamburger with just enough water to moisten so that the sesame seeds will stick when sprinkled on top of each cookie.  NOTE:  You can use canned chocolate frosting in place of peppermint patty, then eliminate the baking.",
