    "des": "\"Aunt Iola MacArthur's from Nita Nolan. \nJust the best. Ribs can be simmered the day before then finished on the grill. Bring ribs to near room temp before grilling.\"",
    "ins": "Stir cold water, ketchup, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, paprika, chili powder, and black pepper together in a large pot. Add ribs to the pot. Pour enough water into the pot to cover the ribs completely.\nBring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until ribs are tender, about 90 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCook ribs on preheated grill, basting frequently with sauce, until browned, 12 to 15 minutes.",
