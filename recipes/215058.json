    "des": "\"I whipped this up the other night after a fierce craving for a gyro struck me and I was finding a lot of recipes that weren't quite what I was looking for. I wanted a creamier version of tzatziki. I put it on a tortilla with shredded chicken, cheddar, green leaf lettuce and lots of tomatoes and feta. It was sooo good I was eating it by the spoonful! You can play around with adding a little more mayo or sour cream, as my measurements may not have been exact.\"",
    "ins": "Chop the cucumber in a food processor until nearly liquefied; strain through a piece of cheesecloth to remove excess moisture, being careful to not over-drain and lose too much of the fresh flavor.\nMix the cucumber, yogurt, garlic, sour cream, and mayonnaise together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.",
