    "des": "\"I love trying different flavors in baked goods and when I found rose water in a local grocery store, I absolutely had to try it. Some of the recipes I found for rose-flavored cakes produced flavors that were too floral for me, so I wrote my own recipe. The resulting cake is tender and tasty with just a hint of rose fragrance. I hope you enjoy this cake as much as I do.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 10 rose-shaped cake molds with cooking spray.\nSift flour, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons almond meal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.\nMix milk, rose water, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl.\nCombine 6 tablespoons sugar, egg yolks, and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk mixture, beating batter briefly after each addition.\nBeat egg whites in a separate bowl, with clean beaters, until foamy. Add remaining 7 tablespoons sugar gradually, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold into the batter.\nSpoon batter into the prepared molds.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.",
