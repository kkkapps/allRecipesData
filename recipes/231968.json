    "des": "\"This is an Irish beef stew made with Guinness\u00c2\u00ae. This stew is very hearty and begs for a good sopping bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nHeat olive oil and bay leaves in a 6-quart oven-proof pot over high heat. Place 1/4 cup flour in a shallow bowl, press beef cubes into flour, and sear beef in the hot oil until the meat has a browned crust, about 3 minutes per side. Cook and stir onions with beef until onions are translucent, 5 more minutes. Reduce heat to low.\nCombine garlic, thyme, and rosemary leaves with 2 tablespoons flour in a small bowl; stir flour mixture into beef and onions until thoroughly combined. Pour beer and beef stock into mixture, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix potatoes, carrots, and parsley into beef and sauce; cover pot.\nBraise stew in the preheated oven until potatoes are cooked through and beef is tender, about 3 hours; stir occasionally. Season with salt and black pepper.",
