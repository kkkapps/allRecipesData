    "ins": "Heat oil in a large heavy skillet or deep fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).\nIn a small bowl, mix together cream cheese, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, parsley, cilantro and crabmeat.\nPlace 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture into the center of each wonton wrapper. Fold the won ton wrapper over the stuffing to make a triangle or a half moon, depending on the shape of the won ton wrappers you have purchased. Moisten the edges with a little water, and seal.  Place prepared won tons under a slightly moist paper towel until ready for frying.\nAdd 3 or 4 wontons to the hot oil, and cook until golden brown, turning once. Set aside on paper towels to drain. Repeat until all wontons have been fried.  Serve hot.",
