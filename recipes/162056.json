    "des": "\"This side is a great earthy compliment to any dish.  Not too sweet, not too nutty just a perfect mix.  Apple cider acts as the perfect balance for just a touch of sweetness.  This recipe is perfect paired with Beef Tenderloin in a Port Shitake Reduction.\"",
    "ins": "Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.\nMash the potatoes until smooth, then stir in the hazelnuts, heavy cream, sour cream, and apple cider. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
