    "des": "\"This is a quick and tasty alternative to lasagna!  Use frozen stuffed shells and Italian meatballs to complete this casserole.  If desired, you may prepare this up to two days in advance, simply insert into the oven when ready to bake.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nHeat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in the onion, and cook until translucent, about two minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste, tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, basil, oregano, mushrooms, and 2 cups of the provolone.  Cook until the cheese has melted, stirring occasionally.  While the sauce is cooking, place the frozen shells and meatballs in the bottom of a 9x13 inch glass dish.  Pour the sauce over the shells, then sprinkle on the remaining 2 cups of provolone.  Cover the top of the dish with foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the pasta has cooked through, and the cheese has melted, about 30 minutes.",
