    "des": "\"These quick and easy pan-fried chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.\nSeason both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.\nCook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.\nPour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.\nStir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.\nReturn chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.",
