    "ins": "In saucepan heated to medium, combine port, sugar, cracked pepper and mint, and simmer until consistency of syrup, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.\nPreheat oven to 415 degrees F. Cut figs in half, from top to bottom. Line a baking sheet with a large sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil. Fold up the sheet in the center to create a barrier, splitting the sheet into two sides. On one half, place figs cut side up, and top each with about 1/2 teaspoon of goat cheese.\nToss the nuts in a bowl with butter, salt, pepper and chili powder. Spread in single layer on the other side of the foil-lined pan. Roast 10 minutes. Keep an eye on the nuts so they don't burn.\nTo serve, chop the nuts and sprinkle bits on the figs. Drizzle figs and nuts with port reduction.",
