    "des": "\"A yummy stir-fry that's quick and easy to make, this one's sure to impress!  Pork, vegetables, and peaches are stir-fried over high heat to produce a dish that can be served with either noodles or steamed rice. You can replace the broccoli with snow peas or baby corn. Be sure to get peaches packed in juice.\"",
    "ins": "In a glass bowl or casserole dish, combine the lemon juice, soy sauce, ground ginger, and garlic powder. Place the pork into the dish, cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight.\nHeat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add the pork, marinade and onion, and cook stirring constantly until the meat is cooked through. Throw in the carrot and broccoli, and cook for a few minutes, then add the peaches with the juice, and bring the mixture to a boil. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture, and stir in. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens. Serve over rice or noodles.",
