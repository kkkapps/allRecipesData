    "des": "\"This dish always reminds me of cold winter nights in our flat in Ballymun, where my ex-wife used to make this traditional Dublin winter stew. It relies heavily on Irish sausage and bacon, so try and use these, if you can. If not, use a low-fat bacon, such as Canadian bacon, and a plain uncooked breakfast sausage. Because of the milk, this is sometimes referred to as a white stew.\"",
    "ins": "Place a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat; cook the sausages and bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven until the bacon is crisp; drain fat from the pan, reserving 1 tablespoon of drippings. Crumble the bacon and halve the sausages.\nHeat the reserved drippings to the Dutch oven over low heat along with the crumbled bacon and sausages. Add the onions and carrots; cook and stir until the onions soften, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in the stock and milk; bring to a simmer until the potatoes are fork tender 30 to 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve.",
