    "des": "\"This hearty and spicy cornmeal waffle can be eaten any time of day and is a nice substitute for cornbread when it's too hot out to use your oven. You can also add thinly diced onions or red pepper flakes to the batter if you wish. I like to serve these with jalapeno jelly for breakfast or chili for dinner, and sometimes I eat them with barbeque sauce slathered on top.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.\nBeat egg whites in a large bowl until fluffy. Fold in milk, butter, and honey. Add cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt, stirring slowly until batter is smooth. Fold in corn and green chile peppers.\nScoop some batter onto waffle iron; cook until golden brown and crisp or until waffle iron stops steaming, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
