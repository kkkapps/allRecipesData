    "des": "\"This is a potluck appetizer or side dish that is sweet, sour, and spicy. The sauce is thick enough to cling to the smokies for the most taste with every bite. This recipe also works well with meatballs. Use your favorite fruit jelly and fruit juice or the reserved pineapple juice.\"",
    "ins": "Place the pineapple chunks, pineapple juice, grape jelly, tomato paste, brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, liquid smoke flavoring, and salt into a saucepan over medium heat. Stirring constantly, bring the sauce to a simmer, and cook until the grape jelly melts, about 5 minutes.\nStir in the smoked sausages, and turn the heat to low; cook the sausages in the sauce below a simmer until the sauce is thickened and the flavors have blended, about 30 minutes.",
