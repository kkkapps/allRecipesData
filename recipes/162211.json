    "des": "\"This is a dish that can be used for dinner or even for breakfast. I like it because you can add whatever you like from peppers, tomatoes, potatoes etc. This is another recipe I learned from my mother-in-law on one of my trips to Tunisia. You can enjoy this meal with warm crusty French bread.\"",
