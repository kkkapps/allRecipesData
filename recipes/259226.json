    "des": "\"Puffed corn can be found in the potato chip aisle of your grocery store. This is a great caramel corn without hulls or unpopped kernels. Warning: you need to make a double batch of this because it doesn't last long, at least not in my house. Very addicting. Love it!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nCombine corn puffs and peanuts in a large roasting pan.\nBring butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup to a boil in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in baking soda until mixture foams up. Pour over corn-peanut mixture and toss well using rubber spatulas.\nBake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes, until a cooled piece of corn is crunchy, about 45 minutes.\nSpread on waxed paper to cool. Break apart and transfer to an airtight container.",
