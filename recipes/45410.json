    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp. Drain, crumble, and set aside. In the same skillet, cook and crumble the ground round until evenly browned. Drain.\nIn a large deep casserole dish or Dutch oven, combine the bacon, beef, baked beans, white beans, and butter beans. Stir in the brown sugar, barbeque sauce, and onion soup mix until well blended.\nBake, uncovered, for 1 hour in the preheated oven.",
