    "des": "\"Wow, this is a new favorite! I can't believe how easy and how moist and good the chicken tasted. I made it exactly as posted, and my husband and I both loved it. It's in my regular meal rotation now. \n\nThe chicken strips are first coated with a garlic-Dijon mustard mixture, then pressed in a panko bread crumb mixture before baking. The results is moist, delicious chicken with a slightly crunchy coating. Easy and delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil on a paper towel and use to coat a cooling rack; place on a baking sheet.\nMix mustard and garlic together in a bowl.\nCombine 1 tablespoon olive oil, panko, paprika, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl using a fork.\nCoat each chicken strip in mustard-garlic mixture; press in panko mixture until evenly coated. Place on the prepared cooling rack.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned on the outside and juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
