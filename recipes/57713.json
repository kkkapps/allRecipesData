    "des": "\"I have been told that this is the recipe from a (now defunct) restaurant chain the the San Francisco Bay Area. This creamed corn is in a thick and sweet sauce. This isn't a low-fat side-dish for calorie counters, but once in a while -- live it up! Very tasty with a holiday prime rib or turkey dinner. The recipe does call for M.S.G. (Accent) which I have never used. Frankly, it's delicious and very easy to make, even without the M.S.G.\"",
    "ins": "Place corn kernels, whipping cream, milk, salt, flavor enhancer, sugar, and white or cayenne pepper in a large stockpot. Bring to a slow, low boil beginning on medium heat, stirring frequently. Simmer for 5 minutes on low heat.\nMelt butter in the microwave, or in a small saucepan on low heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Stir into the corn until well blended. Enjoy!",
