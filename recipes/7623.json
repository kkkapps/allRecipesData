Add sifted ingredients alternately with milk and flavorings (see Cook's Note). Beat thoroughly after each addition.\nBeat egg whites until stiff, and fold into mixture. Pour batter into prepared pans.\nBake in preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.
