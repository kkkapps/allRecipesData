    "ins": "Place the red onion, red bell pepper, peas, ginger, carrots, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.  Stir together, and then fold in the tuna.\nIn a small bowl, whisk the sesame oil, rice vinegar, lime juice, and Sriracha(R).  Pour over the tuna mixture and toss gently, trying not to break up the tuna.\nAdd a tablespoon of vinegar to a pan of lightly-salted water and bring it to a gentle simmer, not a hard boil (you'll see little bubbles in the pan).  Crack each egg into a ramekin.  Stir the water in a wide circle (like a whirlpool), and then slide in the egg; repeat for the second egg.  Poach the eggs at a simmer for 4-5 minutes for soft yolks.  Remove the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to a paper towel and allow to drain.\nTo serve, top half of an English muffin with half of the tuna mixture, place a poached egg on top, and then sprinkle with the chopped cilantro and black sesame seeds.",
