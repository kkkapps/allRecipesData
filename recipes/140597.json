    "des": "\"My gal loves prawns, so I looked at all the ways to prepare them with as little 'fridge-to-fork' time as possible. Makes for great 'Movie Night' finger food. There will be a bit of butter brew left, either in the bowl, or on the plate. Onion bread is a good way to clean that up.  Serve with a side of vegetables to make a meal of it.\"",
    "ins": "Mix one tablespoon of lemon zest with the crushed garlic.\nIn a skillet, melt your butter over medium heat.  Once melted, add salt, parsley and the garlic and lemon zest mixture to make a 'butter brew.'  Mix with a spatula.\nPour the lemon juice over the shrimp and sprinkle with two tablespoons of lemon zest .  Add the prawns to the skillet.  Cook them for about one minute, flip and then cook for another minute, until the flesh is firm and no longer translucent.",
