Pour in eggs. As eggs begin to set, slowly pull them the skillet with a spatula, forming soft curds. Continue cooking, until desired doneness. Remove from heat.\nMeanwhile, mix waffle batter according to package directions. Pour 1/4 of the batter into the waffle cone maker, making sure to spread it out evenly.\nClose lid and cook for about 1 minute before checking for doneness. Cook until browned to your liking. Immediately, place done waffle cones into taco holder to form shape.\nStuff with scrambled eggs, then top with bacon, jalapenos, and chives.",
