    "des": "\"This recipe was given to my mother in 1948 by a dear lady in Corpus Christi. There is just enough batter to hold the whole fruits and nuts together. For optimum satisfaction, leave all the fruit and nuts whole.\"",

Grease three 9x5 inch loaf pans, line them with parchment paper, and grease the paper.\nBeat eggs, salt and vanilla together until very light and lemon colored. Add sugar, 1 cup of the flour and 2 teaspoons baking powder. Put brazil nuts, walnuts, pecans, red and green cherries into a large bowl. Dust with the remaining 1/2 cup flour.
