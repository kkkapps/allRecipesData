    "des": "\"Loving whole grain muffins and having a wonderful plum tree led to this recipe, my first submitted to AllRecipes. I hope you like it. I use Santa Rosa Plums with the skin, no need to peel.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.\nPlace the plums into a bowl; pour in water just to cover the plums. Stir in egg and molasses until the mixture is well combined. In another bowl, stir together the oat bran, rolled oats, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon until thoroughly mixed. Pour the plum mixture into the dry ingredients and mix just until moistened. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until the muffins have risen and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes.",
