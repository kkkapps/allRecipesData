    "des": "\"This roast beef is super easy for people who don't have a ton of time to devote to cooking but need to put on a dinner for a large family or group. It comes out perfectly tender with a super flavorful, delicious outer edge and is very tender. Overnight marinating infuses the flavors throughout the entire roast. Mouth-watering!\"",
    "ins": "Use a metal skewer to poke some holes throughout beef rib roast so marinade can penetrate the muscle.\nWhisk together beer, honey, soy sauce, Montreal steak seasoning, and garlic in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add the rib roast, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in refrigerator at least 24 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove rib roast from the marinade. Discard remaining marinade. Place roast into a roasting pan with a rack.\nCook the roast until hot and slightly pink in the center, about 2 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove from oven, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest on top of stove for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.",
