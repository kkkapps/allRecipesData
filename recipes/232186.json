    "des": "\"Bored with traditional Greek salad? I personally do not like feta cheese so I substituted a good fat (avocados) in its place. I have removed the onion that is traditionally found in a Greek salad as it does not complement the addition of mangoes. You can use your favorite Greek salad recipe as well just leave out the onion and add the mango. Goes very well served along with grilled chicken, grilled vegetables, and rice.\"",
    "ins": "Combine tomatoes, cucumbers, red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, orange bell peppers, mangoes and avocados in a large bowl. Add balsamic vinegar and Greek seasoning. Stir salad gently. Set aside for 10 minutes.\nArrange lettuce leaves onto a platter to make a bed of lettuce. Spoon salad mixture onto lettuce.",
