    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe when I couldn't find anything else that would satisfy my cravings for a gourmet shrimp and grits without spending a ton of money at restaurants. This is simple and delicious, and is made with things we mostly all have in our homes. Use chicken stock in grits, if you prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan and slowly whisk in grits; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened and tender, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir farmers cheese, goat cheese, and American cheese into grits until cheese has melted. Set grits aside and keep warm.\nMelt butter with vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir tomato, 2 green onions, and garlic in the hot skillet until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in bacon drippings until combined. Cook and stir shrimp with vegetables until bright pink, about 5 minutes; season to taste with salt and black pepper.\nMix grits into shrimp mixture and stir in half-and-half until smooth. Simmer the mixture to blend flavors, about 5 minutes, and add  sherry. Simmer 3 more minutes before adjusting salt and black pepper. Garnish with sliced green tops of 1 green onion before serving.",
