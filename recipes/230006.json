    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners. Spray liners with cooking spray.\nMix pumpkin puree, egg, sugar, vegetable oil, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a bowl.\nMix flour, pudding mix, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Add about half the chocolate chips; stir. Pour pumpkin mixture into the flour mixture; stir to combine. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups; top with remaining chocolate chips.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
