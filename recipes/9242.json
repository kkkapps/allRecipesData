    "ins": "Mash cranberry sauce with a fork or a potato masher.  Stir in sugar, cranberry juice, mustard, and cloves.\nPlace pork roast in a large, roasting pan.  Pour cranberry sauce mixture over the roast.\nCook at 275 degree F (135 degrees C) for 6 to 8 hours, or until meat is tender.  Remove roast, and keep warm.\nWith a metal spoon, skim the fat from the liquid in the roasting pan.  Pour 2 cups of the remaining roasting liquid (add water to fill out the measure if necessary) into a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Blend cornstarch and cold water to make a paste; stir gradually into boiling liquid.  Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens.  Add salt to taste. Serve with the roast.",
