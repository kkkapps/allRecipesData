    "des": "\"A wonderful custard type pie.  The recipe was given to me by a friend when I had a bumper yield of pears from the tree in our yard.  It's a favorite even when I have to buy the pears.  To make prep time even faster I use a deep dish  pie shell from the frozen food section.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)\nIn a large bowl, combine eggs, flour, sugar, almond extract and melted butter. Pour into unbaked pie crust. Arrange sliced pears in spokes radiating from center.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until custard is firm. Cool completely before serving.",
