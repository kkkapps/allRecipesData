    "des": "\"Sugar and dark corn syrup are cooked with vinegar and tempered with baking soda to make a crunchy candy that gets covered in a chocolate coating.\"",
    "ins": "Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, corn syrup and vinegar.  Cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves.  Heat, without stirring, to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.  Remove from heat and stir in baking soda.  Pour into prepared pan; do not spread.  Mixture will not fill pan.  Allow to cool completely.\nIn the microwave or over a double boiler, melt coating chocolate, stirring frequently until smooth. Break cooled candy into bite sized pieces and dip into melted candy coating.  Let set on waxed paper.  Store tightly covered.",
