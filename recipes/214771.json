    "des": "\"My father-in-law first introduced me to this homemade bloody mary mix.  It is very similar to what you'd buy in a store.  Made as is, it is very spicy.  You can customize it to your taste by cutting back on the pepper and hot sauce;  I like about half the pepper and hot sauce.  Enjoy this wonderful mix!  It is so easy and much cheaper than buying pre-made mix.\"",
