    "des": "\"I wanted a new chicken recipe today, and my mum loves mustard chicken, so I came up with this recipe and it turned out great! Next time I'm going to double the quantity and coat the chicken with 1/2 the marinade. The 2nd half I will heat and serve as a side sauce to the chicken.\"",
    "ins": "Mix olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, mustard seeds, honey, black pepper, and allspice together in a bowl.\nCut small slits in a crosswise-pattern in each chicken breast to help the mustard marinade soak into the chicken. Add chicken to the mustard marinade; toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 hours.\nRemove chicken from marinade and sprinkle with salt. Discard the leftover marinade.\nLightly oil a grill pan and place over medium-high heat.\nCook chicken in the grill pan until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 7 minutes per side.",
