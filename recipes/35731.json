    "des": "\"This is a typical dish of southern Italy. Swordfish is marinated in a lemon and oil mixture, then fried and cooked with fava (broad) beans and white wine.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Add the fish and stir enough to get it coated. Let it marinate for about 15 minutes. Remove fish from the marinade, and pat dry.\nHeat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the onion until golden, then add the fish. Brown the chunks of fish on all sides, then remove from the pan, and set aside.\nStir the flour into the skillet; cook and stir until lightly browned. Gradually stir in the white wine. Return the fish to the pan, and add the fava beans. Sprinkle with fresh parsley, cover, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve hot.",
