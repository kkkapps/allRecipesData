    "des": "\"My Nana used to cook this for me when I was young and as she prepared things and we waited for the sauce to finish, she'd tell me great stories about her life in Sicily and other secret business! This recipe is the best sauce I've ever had- I really think it can bring the family together. Just prepare it and you'll see that when dinner time comes everyone's mouths will be watering because of the great smell, the entire family can gather around the table and there will be enough for everyone, I promise! Good for vegetarians too-just substitute 2 1/2 pounds of chopped zucchini for the meatballs.\"",

Bring sauce to a boil and then turn down the heat and simmer.\nIn a large bowl mix together the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic powder and parsley. Shape into balls the size of a child's fist.  In a skillet, fry meatballs in hot olive oil until brown. Add to sauce mixture.  Simmer over low heat for four hours.",
