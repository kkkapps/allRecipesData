    "des": "\"I have yet to meet a child or adult who doesn't lick their bowl after eating this. A delicious tomato based turkey sausage and bean soup. Very simple and can be ready to eat in minutes or cook for hours. Make a double or triple batch and freeze your leftovers. Serve with a fresh salad and buns for a perfect Sunday lunch or savory dinner.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; cook and stir for about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, breaking into small pieces. Cook and stir for another 5 minutes, or until browned.\nStir in the beans, tomatoes with their juice and chicken broth. Season with rosemary and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, and cook for at least 10 minutes. Serve right away, or let it simmer for a while, stirring occasionally, until you are ready to eat.",
