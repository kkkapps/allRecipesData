    "des": "\"My grandfather's pot roast is the best. Flavorful, moist, and tender, this is worthy to be the centerpiece of the Sunday dinner table! Serve in a bowl as a stew or over white rice with biscuits. Best served with bread to sop up the juices!\"",
    "ins": "Heat a 7 1/2-quart pot over medium-high heat. Sear the fat side of the roast until some of the fat renders, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue to sear pork until browned completely, 2 to 3 minutes per side.\nPour chicken broth into the pot; add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper. Bring the broth to a simmer, place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer, turning every 30 minutes, for 4 hours.\nPut potatoes and baby carrots into the pot so they are covered by liquid; add enough water to ensure the bottom 2/3 of the roast remains submerged. Cover the pot and continue cooking until roast is falling from bone and vegetables are tender, 60 to 90 minutes more.",
