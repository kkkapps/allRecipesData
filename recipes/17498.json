    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nTo Make Crust: Place flour in a large bowl. Cut shortening into flour until mixture resembles coarse meal. Mix in 2 beaten eggs, milk, and vanilla extract, stirring just until all ingredients are combined and dough forms a ball. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.\nRoll out 2 pieces of dough into 12 inch circles. Fit into two 9 inch pie pans. Roll out remaining dough into a rectangle 10 inches wide; cut into 12 strips and reserve for tops of pies.\nTo Make Filling: In a large bowl, mix together ricotta, sugar, salt, 10 beaten eggs, and grated chocolate bar until ingredients are thoroughly combined. Spoon half of mixture into each pastry shell. Use reserved pastry strips to form a lattice on top of each pie.\nBake in preheated oven for 90 minutes, until a knife inserted in filling comes out clean. Cool before serving. Keep refrigerated.",
