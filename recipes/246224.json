She would use her own roasted chickens, but when I'm not feeling well I don't feel like roasting my own chicken, and the store-bought ones work in a pinch. Serve with crusty bread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat chicken stock and sweet potato in a stockpot over high heat. Cook until sweet potato is soft enough to pierce with a fork, about 10 minutes. Stir in spinach, chicken, and garlic; simmer until spinach is wilted and broth is reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.",
