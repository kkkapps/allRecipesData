    "des": "\"This stuff is so creamy and good. It reminds me of the candied almonds from the fairs but in almond butter form. I have expensive taste but not a lot of money so I found a way to make my own almond butter and have a cheap alternative to peanut butter that is easy to make. I have found other recipes that are not very flavorful so I made up my own. Enjoy on toast, sandwiches, crackers, fruit, etc. It goes very well with anything you would put peanut butter on.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpread the almonds into a single layer on a baking sheet.\nRoast the almonds in the preheated oven until dark brown, about 8 minutes. Be careful to not overcook. Allow to cool completely before proceeding.\nBlend the almonds in a blender until thick and creamy, 8 to 10 minutes. The mixture will be very dry initially and then begin to clump. Scrape the sides of the blender with a rubber spatula as needed to keep the almonds blending. Add the white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt; continue blending until completely smooth. Store in refrigerator.",
