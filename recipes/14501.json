    "ins": "Slice each chop down the center horizontally, cutting not quite through.  Open flat to resemble a butterfly. You can also ask your butcher to prepare the meat in this way.\nIn a large, shallow dish, mix together honey and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate pork chops in the mixture for no more than 4 hours.\nPrepare barbecue for indirect cooking.\nPepper the chops to taste, and place on well oiled grate. Cook over medium low heat for 35 to 40 minutes.",
