    "des": "\"The tri-colored pasta along with the variety of vegetables, pepperoni, cheeses and spices is what makes this pasta salad out of this world. Great to take to a BBQ on those warm summer nights. This salad tastes wonderful right after you make it, but is best served the day after.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and chill 1 hour in the refrigerator.\nToss chilled pasta with the broccoli, cauliflower, red onion, garlic, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, olives, olive oil, and red wine vinegar. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.",
