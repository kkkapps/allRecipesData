    "des": "\"The base of this soup used to be a roux-thickened chicken broth with milk and cheese added. However, since becoming vegan, I had to adapt, and I'm proud to say that this version is thicker and creamier than the original, and it was all achieved without a drop of flour or milk. It's not only the best vegan corn chowder recipe I've had, but it's just plain the best corn chowder ever. Even my non-vegan family loves it, and they request it regularly. This recipe makes a lot, but it keeps and freezes very well.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, and carrots in the hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir potatoes, cauliflower, bay leaves, thyme, and oregano into vegetables; cook about 5 minutes more.\nPour vegetable broth and 6 cups corn kernels and into vegetable mixture and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves.\nPlace remaining 2 cups corn kernels, cashews, and nutritional yeast into a blender and add several large spoonfuls of simmering broth to blender. Work in batches if necessary, filling blender no more than half full per batch. Cover lid with a dish towel and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend until smooth. Stir cashew mixture into soup pot; season with salt and black pepper.",
