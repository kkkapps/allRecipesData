    "ins": "Place the okra in a bowl with the vinegar, and soak 30 minutes. Drain, rinse, and cut into 1/2 inch slices.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, reserving drippings in skillet. Break bacon into large pieces, and set aside.\nPlace the onion and green chile peppers in the skillet with the bacon drippings, and cook 3 minutes over medium heat. Mix in the tomatoes, and cook 1 minute. Mix in the okra, and return bacon to skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in enough water to cover. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer 40 minutes, or until okra is tender. Serve hot.",
