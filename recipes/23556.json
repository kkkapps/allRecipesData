    "des": "\"A clear, golden sparkly punch. This makes 18 - 5 ounce glasses. I suggest you plan on several glasses per person unless many guests are teetotalers. I was greatly embarrassed to see how quickly it was disappearing, and ended up with a greatly diluted version before long. I just had to keep adding regular white wine to the mix when the second batch started to empty out. Punch is not hugely popular here, but it certainly was that night!\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan, combine pumpkin pie spice and orange zest to apple juice concentrate. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat. In a large pitcher, combine spiced apple juice concentrate and white wine. Chill in refrigerator overnight.\nStrain the wine mixture through a coffee filter, being careful not to disturb the spices which have settled to the bottom of the pitcher.\nJust before serving, slide in the ice ring. Slowly pour the champagne down the side of the bowl to retain as much carbonization as possible.\nTo make Ice Ring: In a ring shaped mold, combine pineapple chunks, orange slices and maraschino cherries. Pour in just enough water to hold the fruit together in the ring. freeze overnight.",
