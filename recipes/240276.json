    "ins": "Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with non-fat cooking spray. Place dish in refrigerator.\nCombine granulated sugar, applesauce, pineapple-flavored gelatin, unflavored gelatin, lime juice, and coconut extract in saucepan.\nBring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil for about 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat, and cool at room temperature for about 10 minutes. (Do not pour boiling hot liquid into a chilled glass dish.)\nRemove baking dish from refrigerator, and pour warm mixture into the cooled baking dish. Refrigerate until firm,  1 to 2 hours.\nWhen firm, remove from refrigerator, lift one side with a spatula, and turn out onto a cutting board or parchment paper sprinkled with granulated sugar.\nUsing a sharp knife, cut gelatin into squares or use a small cookie cutter for decorative shapes. Coat the jellies on all sides with sugar. Place on a rack, and allow to dry overnight.\nStore in an airtight container.",
