    "ins": "Roast pork according to package directions (takes approximately 30 minutes). Slice meat very thin.\nHeat panini sandwich press, waffle iron, or skillet, depending on how you will cook your sandwiches.\nIn a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, capers and lemon pepper.\nLightly brush one side of each slice of bread with olive oil. Spread the opposite side of four slices of bread with the mayonnaise mixture.\nFor each sandwich, layer arugula leaves, sliced pork and Havarti on top of mayonnaise mixture. Top with another slice of bread without mayo. (Olive oil should be facing OUT.)\nPlace each sandwich in hot sandwich press or skillet. Cook until bread is toasted and cheese is melted, flipping if necessary. Cut in half and serve immediately.",
