    "des": "\"This is an easy-to-make family favorite and has always been served as a side dish at our Thanksgiving dinners. Don't let the horseradish scare you. It merely adds a tangy flavor. You can use pre-made bread crumbs to make it even easier. Light mayo works fine and so does cooking spray on the casserole dish in place of butter.\"",
    "ins": "Place the carrots in a saucepan with about 1 inch of water in the bottom. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Place the carrots in the dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the onion, mayonnaise, horseradish, pepper, paprika and bread crumbs. Spread evenly over the carrots.\nBake uncovered for 15 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned.",
