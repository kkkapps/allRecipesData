    "des": "\"Delicious fried chicken the way the Greeks make it. Very tasty. You'll want more. Compliment your chicken with some boiled kale, spinach, or string beans seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine chicken pieces with 1/2 cup olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, salt, oregano, cinnamon, and poultry seasoning.  Allow the chicken to soak in the oil and seasonings for five minutes. In fact, rub the marinade into the chicken using your hands.\nHeat 1/2 cup olive oil over low heat in a 1 1/2 inch deep frying pan with a lid to fit (to keep the juices in the chicken). Carefully lay the chicken pieces in the frying pan. Put the lid on the pan, and cook until chicken is done, about 20 minutes, flipping pieces occasionally.  Increase heat to medium-high, and cook just long enough to make the outside of the chicken brown.\nServe hot, garnished with lemon wedges. Squeeze some lemon on the chicken for delicious added flavor.",
