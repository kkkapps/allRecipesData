    "ins": "Rub the garlic all over the inside of your fondue pot, leaving the crushed pieces in the bottom. You can also make fondue in a regular sauce pan and transfer to the fondue pot, but why get two pans all crazy cheesy? Add the white wine and sherry to the pot and heat over medium-low heat.\nToss the cheese cubes in cornstarch to coat. When the wine is hot, add the cheese. Stir slowly with a wooden spoon at first and then use a whisk. Stir constantly to keep it from scorching on the bottom of the pot. When the cheese has melted, remove it from the heat and grate in a little nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The fondue should be smooth and coat a wooden spoon. If it seems to runny, add more cheese. If it is too thick, add a splash more wine --sparingly.\nPrepare your fondue pot base and keep fondue warm over low heat. Get out the good linen napkins and set the table. This is a meal to be proud of!",
