Add zucchini and red pepper flakes. Continue to cook and stir until zucchini are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a large bowl and cover with aluminum foil.\nSeason chicken breast halves with kosher salt and black pepper.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in the same skillet used to cook zucchini. Pan-fry chicken in hot oil until juices run clear and center is no longer pink, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cut into strips. Cover with aluminum foil.\nWhisk milk and flour together in a bowl.\nHeat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan; cook and stir remaining 1 clove garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
