    "des": "\"Potato salad with a Texas flair - I get many requests to bring this to picnics. Nice blend of potatoes, black beans, green onions, bacon, and jalapenos. Sometimes I sprinkle dried crushed red hot peppers over top for color and taste.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender. Drain, dice, and cool.\nPlace eggs in a pot with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover saucepan, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and chop.\nPlace bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.\nIn a large bowl, mix chopped eggs, 1/2 the bacon, black beans, green onions, jalapeno peppers, bell pepper, mayonnaise, mustard, and Cajun seasoning. Gently mix in diced, cooled potatoes. Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with remaining bacon. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
