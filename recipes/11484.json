If you have a mixer with a dough hook attachment, mix for about 15 minutes.\nLet dough rest for 10 minutes.\nOn a floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into strips that are 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  In  the center of each strip, cut a 1 inch slit, lengthwise. Pull one end of the strip through the slit to form a bow.\nIn a frying pan or an electric skillet, melt shortening and heat to about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). in a frying pan this would be on medium high heat.\nPlace cookies in hot oil. Cook on both sides until lightly browned then remove to a paper towel.\nDust finished cookies with confectioners sugar.",
