    "ins": "Cook and stir sesame seeds in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are fragrant and toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer immediately into a small bowl and let cool.\nMix ground beef, green onions, roasted garlic, mirin wine, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, black pepper, salt, and toasted sesame seeds together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Divide the meat mixture into 8 portions and form each portion into a large beef patty about 1/2 inch thick.\nPan-fry the burgers in a large skillet over medium-low heat until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the burgers should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees F).",
