    "des": "\"Poke (pronounced pok-eh) is a seasoned tartare, usually with tuna (ahi). If you love tuna sashimi or sushi, you will love this easy recipe which is spiced up with a little wasabi, which I love. Serve over hot sticky rice, with chips, or eat straight on as a salad.\"",
    "ins": "Mix soy sauce, wasabi, sesame oil and green onion together in a small bowl. Add diced tuna and stir to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to marinate for 2 hours. Drain the tuna; discard marinade.\nTo construct the tower, mound and flatten the cucumber in the center of a serving platter. Top the cucumber with mango and then the avocado. Place the marinated tuna on top. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.\nTo serve, place chips around the poke tower for scooping. Or serve with hot sticky (sushi) rice, or enjoy as is as a salad.",
