    "des": "\"Makes about 35 wonderful nougat balls. This recipe is from my German grandmother - yum. This is the 'G' version; add rum to make it for adults. Use high-quality ingredients - the best chocolate and cocoa you can find. They're worth it!\"",
    "ins": "Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove the bowl from the heat.\nIn a separate bowl, combine the confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder. Use a wire whisk to break up lumps. Mix in the vanilla and coffee. Stir in the nuts, and, if necessary, add additional coffee to make the mixture smooth. The mixture should be fairly thick.\nAllow the mixture to cool enough to handle. Shape the mixture into 1/2- to 3/4-inch diameter balls. Dip the balls into the melted chocolate. Chill until firm.",
