    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix melted butter, parsley, olive oil, and garlic together in a bowl.\nSlice bread diagonally without cutting all the way through; do the same on the opposite diagonal to create cube-shaped sections still attached to the bottom crust.\nSpoon butter mixture carefully between sections; stuff in shredded Italian cheese blend. Wrap loaf in aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; unwrap and bake until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes more.",
