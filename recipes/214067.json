    "des": "\"This is a bread machine recipe. Try it to make a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich. It's amazing. It uses the machine's dough cycle but is baked in the oven.\"",
    "ins": "Place water, milk, vanilla extract, brown sugar, white sugar, cardamom, coriander, vegetable oil, and salt into the pan of a bread machine in that order. Pour the flour onto the other ingredients, and sprinkle the flour with yeast. Set the bread machine to the Dough cycle; turn on the machine.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch bread pan.\nWhen the Dough cycle is completed, remove the dough from the machine, punch down if necessary, form into a loaf, and place into the prepared bread pan with the seam side down. Cover and let rise until doubled, 20 to 30 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven until the loaf is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to finish cooling on a rack.",
