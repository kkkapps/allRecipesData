    "des": "\"This is a good cake frosting, and is especially good when the maple syrup can be purchased in March.  You can use the artificial for those of you who do not live in the north, or cannot obtain it.  This recipe will fill and frost a 9 inch cake.\"",

Beat with a mixer until frosting has a good spreading consistency, and will stand in peaks.  Remove from heat.\nFill and frost cake.  Sprinkle the top with chopped nuts.",
