    "des": "\"This is a very old pie commonly found in the Midwest. Although most recipes call for dark raisins, this one uses sultanas ( golden raisins).  Use real maple syrup for the right consistency ( Grade B if you can get it). Best to use sour cream that is not low fat or fat free.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C).\nRoll out the pastry for the shell, and fit into a 10 inch pan.  Sprinkle the raisins over the bottom of the crust.\nCombine the egg yolks, egg, sour cream, syrup, sugar, nutmeg, vanilla, and flour in a bowl.  Mix just until blended, not too much.  Pour filling into the shell.  Sprinkle a little more nutmeg on top.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool, and then chill the pie.",
