Top with ham and remaining Cheddar cheese slices.\nUnroll second package of crescent roll dough onto a flat work surface. Pinch seams together. Place over the Cheddar cheese. Press edges with a fork to seal. Cut shallow slices into the top of the dough to allow steam to escape during baking.\nWhisk egg and water together in a bowl; brush over dough.
