    "ins": "Beat eggs with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg in a large bowl. Mix in ricotta cheese and spinach until evenly blended. Continue mixing in the flour, 1/4 cup at a time until a soft dough forms. If the dough is still sticky, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour. Cover, and place into refrigerator.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Divide the gnocchi dough into 4 pieces, and roll into 1/2 inch thick ropes on a floured surface. Slice each rope into 1/2 inch pieces. Gently boil the gnocchi until they float in the water, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain in a colander, and set aside.\nMeanwhile, pour cream, wine, brandy extract, and 1 pinch of nutmeg into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat and whisk in the Gorgonzola cheese; season to taste with salt and pepper. Toss the gnocchi with the Gorgonzola sauce, and serve immediately.",
