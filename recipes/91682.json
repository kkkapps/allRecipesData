    "des": "\"This is a delicious recipe using inexpensive skirt steak.  Saltimbocca literally translates to 'jump in the mouth' and the bold flavors in this recipe will do just that.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut the steak into approximately 4 ounce pieces, then pound each one to 1/4 inch thickness. Season with black pepper. On each piece of steak, lay one slice of provolone cheese, a few leaves of sage and 2 slices of prosciutto. Roll into pinwheels  and secure with toothpicks.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly brown the pinwheels on the outside. Transfer to a baking dish if your skillet is not oven-safe.\nBake for 7 minutes for medium rare, or 10 for medium. Let rest for 5 minutes before carving into thin pinwheels. Place the skillet back over medium-high heat, and add any remaining sage leaves. Fry until crispy and then use them to garnish steaks.",
