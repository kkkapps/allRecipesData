    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, olives, and garbanzo beans and continue to cook until the peppers are slightly tender, about 5 minutes more.\nSprinkle the parsley, paprika, cumin, cayenne, and chicken bouillon over the vegetables. Season with salt to taste. Stir to incorporate. Place the fish on top of the vegetables and add enough water to cover the vegetables. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork and juices run clear, about 40 minutes.",
