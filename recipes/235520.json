    "des": "\"It's fall. It's time for hot cocoa, cozy blankets, and lazy Sundays spent watching movies. In honor of the season, this is a recipe I love for Sunday morning pumpkin pie pancakes. They're tasty, perfect for the season, and pretty healthy for you too! \n\nThese are the best in town. Try them out and let me know what you think.\"",
    "ins": "Blend oats, cottage cheese, egg whites, pumpkin puree, milk, pumpkin pie spice, honey, and cinnamon in blender until batter is smooth; pour into a bowl.\nHeat a pan or skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray.\nScoop batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, into the hot pan; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
