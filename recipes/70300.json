    "des": "\"Easy economical salmon loaf that tastes great! Terrific during Lent. Unlike most fish recipes, this tastes even better the next day. Add a simple white sauce with dill for a more elegant presentation.\"",

Grease one 8x4 inch loaf pan.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the salmon, bread crumbs, carrots, mustard, eggs, milk, butter, lemon juice, parsley, salt and pepper using your hands until evenly blended.
