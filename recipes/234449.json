    "des": "\"A healthy hummus, with a sushi-like twist! This is my first ever published recipe, so please be honest and kind in your comments! For my first batch I tried adding a sheet of nori (seaweed). I do not recommend this, unless you REALLY like the flavor of nori, as it completely overpowered the other flavors. Maybe some small slices on top, as a garnish?  I've found that this recipe makes a nice condiment on sandwiches, too!\"",
    "ins": "Combine about 1/2 the chickpeas, soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, tahini, wasabi powder, garlic, and black pepper in a blender; blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender bowl with a spatula to assure ingredients fully integrated. Scrape mixture into a bowl.\nPut remaining chickpeas into the blender, reserving 5 to 7 individual beans for later use. Blend until smooth, adding reserved liquid from the cans if moisture is needed to get them smooth; add to the prior batch and stir.\nMake a shallow pool in the center of the hummus with the back of a spoon; garnish with reserved chickpeas and a small amount of olive oil.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.",
