    "des": "\"This is my mother-in-law's grandmother's recipe from the Depression era. When eggs and milk were in very short supply she created this recipe out of need. It is our favorite cake AND it is easy to make! No mixer is needed. Just a light whisking gets it all mixed. Don't let the fact that it is vegan fool you - you'd never guess it by the taste! Enjoy!\"",
