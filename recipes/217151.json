    "des": "\"Moist, flavorful and absolutely one of the best meat loaf recipes yet!  Using a large muffin pan allows the mini meat muffins to cook faster and makes portion sizing easier. I like to serve this with sweet potatoes or butternut squash.  I think the mini meat loaves taste great the next day as they are easy to put away and re-heat.  Try making a meat loaf sandwich out of them too.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large muffin pan with cooking spray.\nCombine ground beef, blue cheese, onion, bread crumbs, spinach, eggs, and Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl until well blended. Divide meat mixture evenly into the prepared muffin pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
