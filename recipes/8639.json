    "ins": "Heat honey, soy sauce, and garlic in a saucepan until boiling.\nPlace the wings in the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch baking pan, and pour the honey mixture over the chicken.  Cover with foil.  Marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.\nBake, covered,  at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour; turn the wings after 1/2 hour.  Remove the foil cover, and bake for 15 minutes. Take the wings out of the sauce, and bake on a rack for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken wings, and cook for another 10 minutes.",
