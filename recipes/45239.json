    "des": "\"This is a tasty dish from back in the days when flavor was all that mattered. This soup consists of green beans and bacon in a thick bacon gravy. Two pounds of fresh green beans may be used instead of canned.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until almost crisp. Remove bacon pieces, and set aside. Whisk flour into the bacon grease in the pan until it is thick and pasty. More or less flour may be required.\nEmpty the cans of beans into a large saucepan with their liquid, and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and stir in the bacon and the bacon grease mixture. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about an hour - the longer, the better.  Season with vinegar to taste.",
