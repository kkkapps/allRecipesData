    "des": "\"A self-concocted recipe born from long nights and late mornings. A truly hearty, robust stand-alone meal. Known coast to coast thanks to wonderful friends. Likely one of my most memorable dishes according to said friends. Serve with a side of salsa, a tortilla, and your favorite glass of juice.\"",
    "ins": "Place sausage in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until crumbly and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in potatoes; cook until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms; cook until tender, about 5 minutes.\nPush mixture to the sides of the skillet with a spatula to make space in the center. Crack eggs into the center and sprinkle with parsley. Sprinkle Mexican cheese blend around mixture on the edges. Cover skillet and cook until egg whites are set but yolk is still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, pierce yolks and mix to combine. Season with salt and black pepper.",
