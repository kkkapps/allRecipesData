Season salmon with lemon-pepper and onion salt; top with onion rings and lemon slices, dot with butter. Fold foil around salmon and seal tightly.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Unseal the foil and turn the oven's broiler on. Continue cooking the salmon under the broiler until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 12 minutes.\nWhile the salmon bakes, stir sour cream, mayonnaise, white wine, capers, chopped onion, caper brine, lemon juice, horseradish, dill weed, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Serve with the salmon.",
