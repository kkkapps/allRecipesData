    "ins": "Place ground beef into a large skillet and cook, stirring often, until the beef is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes. Stir in green onions after 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.\nPlace ground beef mixture into a large soup pot over medium heat.\nStir in black beans, corn and its liquid, chili seasoning mix, crushed tomatoes, and water; stir to combine. If chili seems too thick, mix in a little more water.\nCover the chili and cook 1 hour; add processed cheese cubes, allow to melt, and stir into the chili until smooth just before serving.",
