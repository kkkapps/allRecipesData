Slowly pour water over the grounds.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and steep at room temperature for 18 to 24 hours.\nLine a strainer with several layers of cheesecloth and place atop a pitcher; strain coffee through the cheesecloth into the pitcher. Discard the grounds. To get a clearer brew, strain coffee again through coffee filters. Store in refrigerator.",
