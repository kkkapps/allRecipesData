    "des": "\"This is the easiest chicken recipe with loads of flavors! It creates it own juice (or broth) so it won't be dry. You can spice it to your tastes and add any vegetables you like. It's great with rosemary roasted potatoes or saffron rice on the side.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with non-stick aluminum foil.\nPlace chicken pieces in the pan. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of rosemary, cayenne, salt, and pepper over chicken. Add yellow squash, zucchini, onion, and grape tomatoes; mix and spread evenly. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons of rosemary, minced garlic, garlic salt, and parsley on top. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until chicken is tender, about 45 minutes.\nIncrease oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Uncover baking pan; baste chicken with accumulated juices. Bake, uncovered, until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes more.",
