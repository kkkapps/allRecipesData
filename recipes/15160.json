Separate one sheet of phyllo from stack, brush lightly with melted butter or margarine, and place sheet in a 9-inch pie pan. Let edges of dough hang over sides of pan. Continue this process with 4 more sheets of phyllo dough. Spread cream cheese mixture evenly into pan.\nSpread fruit filling over cream cheese layer. Fold overhanging phyllo dough over fruit layer. Brush another sheet of phyllo with melted butter or margarine and lay over top of pie. Continue this process with remaining 4 sheets of phyllo.\nTuck edges of top phyllo sheets inside pie between pan and filling, sealing well.

Refrigerate leftovers, if any ...",
