    "des": "\"This is a slightly healthier spin on traditional fried apples. The skin is left on, and the reduced butter and sugar are offset with flavor-boosting bourbon, raisins, cinnamon, and lemon juice. I use Cameos for this recipe, as they are naturally sweet and hold their shape well, but if you're using a tarter variety, you may wish to increase the brown sugar and omit the lemon juice. Golden rum can substitute for the bourbon.\"",
    "ins": "Combine water, butter, and Bourbon in a large skillet over medium heat; stir until butter melts. Add apples, raisins, brown sugar, and cinnamon; stir to coat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring frequently, until apples have softened and liquid has reduced to a syrup, about 10 minutes. Stir lemon juice into apples and serve warm.",
