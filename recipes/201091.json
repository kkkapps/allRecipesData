    "des": "\"This is a pure and simple comfort food without any pretense.  When the sports seasons took over, my mum had to resort to easy calories to get our large family through each night.

    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix beef, onion soup mix, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Evenly divide meat mixture into the pie crusts and top with hash browns.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow pies to rest for 10 minutes before serving.",
