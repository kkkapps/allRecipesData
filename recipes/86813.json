    "des": "\"The flaky phyllo crust keeps the halibut moist and delicious. For a nicer presentation, cut halibut in half at an angle before placing on sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nLightly butter 1 sheet of phyllo dough. Lay another sheet directly on top of the first sheet, and lightly butter it. Repeat with remaining 2 sheets of phyllo. Cut sheets in half.\nSeason halibut fillets with salt and pepper. Place a fillet near the bottom edge of one of the halved sheets of phyllo. Sprinkle with dill. Fold in the sides of the phyllo, then roll the fillet. Place on a baking sheet, and lightly brush with butter. Repeat with remaining fillet.\nBake in a preheated oven until pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, bring lemon juice to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Boil until almost evaporated. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in cream. Simmer until the cream thickens somewhat. Stir in green onions, and season with salt and pepper. Serve halibut on a pool of sauce.",
