    "des": "\"This is the concoction I came up with when I couldn't find quite what I was looking for. It is absolutely foolproof. It's simple, sweet, and tart, with just enough limoncello liqueur. Serve with sprig of mint or fresh berries. Top with limoncello or vodka if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Combine 1 cup water, sugar, and fresh mint leaves in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a light boil, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in lemon zest. Let syrup cool slightly, about 10 minutes.\nMix remaining 1 1/2 cup water, lemon juice, and limoncello liqueur into syrup.\nPour mixture into an ice cream maker; churn according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 15 minutes. Freeze until firm, about 6 hours.",
