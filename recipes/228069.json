    "des": "\"This recipe is a tribute to my Uncle who is by far one the best pit masters I have ever known. Feel free to put this on chicken, pork, or just about anything else you can think of. To cover a typical 5-pound chicken, I normally measured the spices in tablespoons. However, feel free to mix a larger batch to keep some finished product on hand. One thing's for sure, you will be the hit of the party!\"",
