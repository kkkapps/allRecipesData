    "ins": "Place shredded cabbage in a bowl; sprinkle with salt and toss to combine. Allow cabbage to stand for 30 minutes; squeeze cabbage dry and discard juice.\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir cabbage and onion until cabbage is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well.\nLightly mix egg noodles into the cabbage mixture; season with salt and black pepper if needed and sprinkle with caraway seeds.",
