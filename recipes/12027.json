    "des": "\"A nice microwave alternative to baked macaroni and cheese. Vary the recipe by using farfalle, fusilli, or rotini pasta. You may add cooked chicken or tuna to this recipe for a more hearty meal.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot with boiling salted water cook the elbow macaroni until al dente. Drain and set aside.\nIn a 2-quart microwave-safe covered casserole dish, cook the onions and butter or margarine on high for 3 to 4 minutes.\nAdd the cooked and drained pasta, milk, and cubed cheese and stir. Cook for 11 to 12 minutes on high, stirring well after 4, 8, and 11 minutes. The mixture will still be runny at this stage. Add salt and pepper to taste.\nLet stand for 5-8 minutes before serving. The sauce will thicken as it cools slightly.",
