    "des": "\"I used half the wings to make a basic reduction sauce and the subtle smokiness worked wonderfully with the red wine, balsamic vinegar, and blackberry notes. The sauce is certainly optional, as this could be served plain with just some cranberry sauce on the side. I hope you're able to give this very easy-to-prepare, gorgeous roast goose a try.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove top wing flat section from each wing. Place goose, breast-side up, in a baking dish or roasting pan.\nCombine wing sections, water, wine, and star anise in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer until meat falls off the bone, about 2 hours. Remove bones and star anise; discard.\nRoast goose in the preheated oven until completely heated through, about 1 1/4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 150 degrees F (66 degrees C).\nStir balsamic vinegar, blackberry jam, and black pepper into red wine mixture; bring to simmer over medium heat. Simmer until reduced by three quarters, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Whisk in cold butter until completely incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nBrush melted goose fat from bottom of pan onto the goose breast. Drizzle with sauce and serve.",
