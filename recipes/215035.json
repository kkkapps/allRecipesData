Pour in the couscous, stir to combine, and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Cover and remove from heat. Let cool. Drain off any excess liquid remaining.\nPlace the cooled couscous in a salad bowl, and lightly combine with lemon zest, almonds, celery, onion, tomato, and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before refrigerating until cold, at least 1 hour.",
