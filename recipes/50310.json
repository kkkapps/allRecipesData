    "des": "\"This is about the only way to serve 4 with one pork tenderloin. Cubed tenderloin rolled in beaten eggs and sprinkled with cornstarch is sauteed with shredded carrot and green pepper. Make some rice while waiting for the pork to dry, so this can be served immediately.\"",
    "ins": "Coat the cubes of pork in beaten egg, then roll them in cornstarch until well coated. Set in a single layer on waxed paper and let dry for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.\nIn a medium bowl whisk together the sugar, vinegar, beef bouillon cube, and hot water until the bouillon cube is dissolved. Add the carrot and green pepper, and toss to coat.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork cubes, and stir-fry until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes. Add the carrot mixture, and cook, stirring over medium heat for 3 minutes, or until meat is cooked through. Serve immediately over rice.",
