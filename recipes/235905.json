    "des": "\"Made with sweet vanilla bean gelato sandwiched between RITZ Crackers, these mini sandwiches are dipped in chocolate and chopped hazelnuts, then frozen for a perfect sweet treat with game day festivities. This RITZ recipe is inspired by Screme Gelato Bar in NYC (with the best gelato!).\"",
    "ins": "Lay out 3 or 4 RITZ Crackers, salted side down, on a parchment-line baking sheet. Quickly scoop 1 tablespoon gelato onto each cracker. Top each with a RITZ cracker. Press down lightly to flatten gelato to extend to cracker edges; wipe off excess and immediately place in the freezer until frozen solid, about 3 hours. Repeat with remaining crackers and gelato to make 25 sandwiches.\nWhen the sandwiches are frozen, melt chocolate on top of a double boiler.\nIn small batches and working quickly, dip sandwiches halfway into melted chocolate. Immediately dip chocolate half into chopped nuts. Place sandwiches back into the freezer. Freeze 2 to 3 hours to set.",
