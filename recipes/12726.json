    "des": "\"The citrus marinade used in this recipe is made with sprigs of fresh marjoram.  One or two hours of marinating is all that is required: a longer period affects the texture of the fish.\"",
    "ins": "Mix together grapefruit juice, olive oil, 2 teaspoons marjoram, salt, and pepper, in a shallow glass dish.  Add fish, turn once to coat both sides, then cover dish.  Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours, turning once or twice.\nPreheat barbecue or gas grill.\nReserve marinade, and place fish in lightly oiled wire basket.  Place fish 4 to 6 inches above hot coals.  Grill for 10 to 12 minutes, turning once and brushing twice with reserved marinade, until steaks are barely opaque in thickest part.  Arrange on a platter, scatter grapefruit sections around steaks, and garnish with sprigs of marjoram.",
