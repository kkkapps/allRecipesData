    "ins": "Push 1 piece of candy corn, pointed side forward, into the ends of each finger and thumb of the plastic gloves to make fingernails. Mix remaining 25 candy corn pieces with popped popcorn in a bowl. Fill the remaining space in the fingers and hands of the gloves with the mixture, pushing the popcorn mix into the voids. Leave a little space at the wrists. Tie each popcorn hand at the wrist with a twist tie. Serve on a platter and scatter plastic insects around the hands.",
