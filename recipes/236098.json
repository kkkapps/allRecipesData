Cover pork with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.\nPlace the pork into a slow cooker and add enough water to just cover the pork. Cover and cook on High for 4 hours or on Low for 6 to 8 hours.\nTransfer pork to a large bowl and shred with 2 forks; discard any bone, skin, and excess fat. Drain and reserve cooking liquid from the slow cooker. Return shredded pork to the slow cooker and stir in barbeque sauce.\nReduce heat to Low and cook for 2 more hours. Add enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten the pork to taste.",
