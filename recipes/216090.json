Break the meat up into crumbles as it cooks. Drain off excess fat, then place the meat into a soup pot. Mix in the diced tomatoes with green peppers, chili beans, tomato sauce, chili powder, masa harina, cumin, salt, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Bring the chili to a simmer, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour.",
