    "des": "\"I fell in love with the curry vegetable pot pie at a local but very pricey bakery, so I decided to try and make my own version! This is what I came up with using a few other recipes as guidelines. I think it's even better than what I was trying to mimic. Any combination of squash, sweet potato, potato, carrots, parsnips, turnips, rutabaga, pumpkin etc. will do. I can recommend highly a combination of sweet potato, mini red potatoes, parsnips, and carrots.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace sweet potato, red potatoes, parsnips, and carrots in a roasting pan. Toss with olive oil; season with sea salt and black pepper.\nRoast sweet potato mixture in the preheated oven until vegetables are slightly softened, 20 to 30 minutes.\nHeat 1 tablespoon butter in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add sweet potato mixture and 2 more tablespoons butter; season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until butter is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.\nHeat vegetable broth and milk together in a separate saucepan over medium heat until mixture is almost at a boil.\nStir flour and curry powder into sweet potato mixture until evenly coated. Gradually pour broth mixture into sweet potato mixture; stir until liquid is thickened, about 3 minutes. Divide mixture among four pot pie dishes. Top each with a puff pastry square.\nBake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and puffed, 17 to 20 minutes.",
