    "ins": "Heat 1 teaspoon canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apples, 1 tablespoon sugar, and cinnamon in the hot oil until apples are slightly softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.\nWhisk milk, butter, egg, bourbon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Sift all-purpose flour, oat flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into milk mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in apples and bacon.\nHeat remaining 1 teaspoon canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; drop batter, about 1/2 cup per pancake, onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip pancake and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 5 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
