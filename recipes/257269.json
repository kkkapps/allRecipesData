    "des": "\"No carrots are in it, but this eye-catching appetizer was a big hit this Easter (2015). Not too salty and not too spicy... just right! And for me the hostess, it was quick and easy to make - an extra bonus! Serve with crackers, pita chips, or toast. Create your own shape to accent your next holiday or special occasion table.\"",
    "ins": "Chop black olives and green olives in a food processor or a food chopper.\nMix cream cheese, 4 ounces Cheddar cheese, chopped olives, and taco seasoning together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed. Increase speed to medium and mix until well combined.\nTransfer cheese mixture to a flat serving plate. Shape cheese mixture into a 2-inch-thick carrot shape using a silicone bowl scraper. Press 2 ounces Cheddar cheese over the entire \"carrot\". Insert parsley sprigs into the top of the \"carrot\". Remove excess cheese from the plate using a damp napkin. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.",
