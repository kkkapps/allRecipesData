    "ins": "Mix together egg yolks, cream, salt, sugar and butter. Gradually stir in flour until dough becomes stiff enough to roll out.\nRoll out paper thin and cut into triangles. (Grandma would cut a slit in the middle of each and twist a corner through the slit to make them look fancier.)\nPut enough oil in a pot to cover cookie. Heat oil until a small amount of dough placed in oil begins to fry.  Deep fry each cookie in hot oil until light brown. Remove cookie from oil and drain excess oil on paper towels. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.",
