    "des": "\"This is a sweet (pear) sauce with a little kick (cranberry) in it; a wonderful chutney for just about any type of meat you can think of. This will be replacing my gravy at Thanksgiving and Christmas. \nMy 4-year-old daughter loves it and so does half my neighborhood. It is so easy to make, too; all you do is you put everything in a big saucepan and you are good to go. The chutney will thicken more as it cools; store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Combine cranberries, pears, water, white sugar, raisins, brown sugar, wine, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, ground cloves, and ground allspice in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until thickened, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes.\nRemove from heat; cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.",
