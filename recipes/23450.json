Remove from heat and set aside for 20 minutes.\nRemove the garlic from the butter, and discard it.  To the garlic flavored butter add onions and thyme.  Cover the pot and braise the onion over medium heat for 5 minutes, or until soft and transparent.  Increase the heat to medium-high, uncover the pot and slightly caramelize the onion.\nStir the green beans into the pot.  After 1 to 2 minutes, de glaze the pot with red wine vinegar.  Season to taste with sea salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Sprinkle with parsley.",
