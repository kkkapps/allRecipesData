    "des": "\"These anise cookies are versatile and delicious. Oil can be used in place of margarine for a lower fat version.  Any type of nuts can also be used in place of the walnuts. These elegant twice baked cookies are perfect for company.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, beat the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing until smooth. Combine the flour, salt and baking powder, stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in the chopped walnuts and anise seed. Shape the dough into 4 or 5 rolls that are the same length as the cookie sheets. Place the rolls onto ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly.\nBake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until just starting to brown. Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks. When the rolls are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, cut the rolls crosswise into 1 inch slices. Place the slices cut-side down on the cookie sheets and return to the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes more, until golden and crispy.",
