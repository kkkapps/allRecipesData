    "ins": "Pour chicken stock and wine into a small pot; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.\nHeat oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the rice; cook and stir until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.\nLadle enough of the chicken stock mixture into the saucepan to cover the rice. Cook and stir until the liquid is mostly absorbed, about 2 minutes. Repeat this process with the remaining chicken stock mixture, stirring frequently until rice is tender and creamy, 15 to 20 minutes.\nToss green beans into the risotto; cook until bright green, about 2 minutes. Stir in pumpkin; cook until broken down, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, figs, pecans, salt, and pepper and mix well. Garnish with remaining 6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese.",
