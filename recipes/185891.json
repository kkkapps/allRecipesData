    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe because chicken breast by itself is rather bland in flavor. After several attempts, I finally came up with this full-flavored yet easy to make grilled chicken. It combines sophisticated Italian elements while being a simple indoor/outdoor grilling dish.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nPlace the olives, capers, garlic, parsley, crushed red pepper, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 6 tablespoons olive oil in a blender or food processor; process until evenly blended into a smooth puree, adding more olive oil if needed to make smooth.\nUsing a small sharp knife, first cut each chicken breast in half. Then cut a pocket into the side of each piece of chicken, going to within 1/2 inch of each edge. Stuff each pocket of the chicken liberally with the olive puree. Close the pockets with toothpicks. Brush olive oil over the entire outer surface of the chicken; season with salt and pepper.\nCook the chicken breasts, turning once, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
