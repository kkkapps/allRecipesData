    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine flour, whole wheat flour, salt, nutmeg and pepper; mix.   Make a well in the center and add eggs and  2 tablespoons olive oil; beat well.  In a bowl combine chestnut puree and 1/2 cup water; add to egg mixture. Incorporate flour and egg mix. Dough will be very stiff. Adjust with more flour or water. Knead for 10 minutes and allow dough to rest for 5 minutes.\nCut off a handful of dough.  With a rolling pin, roll 6 inch wide strips, 1/16\" thick. Use a pasta machine if you have one. Dust strips with flour. Allow to slightly dry on muslin cloth. Cut into long pasta 1/4\" wide. Dry for 30 minutes.\nAdd pasta to a large pot of rapidly boiling salted water with a tablespoon of oil.  Boil for 5 minutes; drain.  Mix pasta with olive oil, minced garlic, Romano cheese, salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.",
