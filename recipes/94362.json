    "des": "\"Once you try these you may need to go back to a cheaper whiskey!!  Extremely tasty and addicting! I make them shaken. 'Up' on a cool day before dinner, or with ice on a hot day anytime.  Good quality ingredients are the key to making this drink unforgettable.  However, very well worth it, (if you're over the age of 45 and a Manhattan lover).\"",
