Set aside.\nIn a medium bowl whisk together milk, egg whites and molasses.\nMake a well in the dry ingredients and pour wet ingredients into it.  Stir just enough to moisten; batter will be lumpy.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.",
