It's easy to control the heat by removing the seeds and ribs (the whitish membrane inside the pepper) before dicing to result in a dip that is mild, medium, or hot and spicy, to suit your taste. For a mild dip, remove all seeds and ribs. For a very spicy dip, leave all the seeds and ribs intact. Serve with sliced sourdough baguettes.\"",
