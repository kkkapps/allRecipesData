    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpray a large roasting pan with cooking spray. Place pork roast in the pan and arrange sauerkraut around it. Place apple wedges on top of the sauerkraut. Sprinkle brown sugar over roast and apples. Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil.\nBake roast in the preheated oven until roast is slightly pink in the center, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nRemove roast from oven and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, about 10 minutes.",
