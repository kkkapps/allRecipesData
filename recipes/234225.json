To make the 'legs' of the octodog, make 3 cuts on 1 side of each hot dog, leaving about 1/3 the rounded top of the hot dog for the 'head'. Turn hot dog over and make 3 more cuts, so you have 8 'legs'.\nPlace the octodogs in the boiling water until cooked through and the 'legs' curl up, about 1 minute.",
