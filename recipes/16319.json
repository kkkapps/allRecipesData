    "des": "\"This is a delicious flank steak. The stuffing makes it much more filling, but there's never any left over! Can also be cooked in the microwave. Just cover and cook at medium setting (50 per cent) in a microwave-safe dish for 30 minutes, rotating dish halfway through cooking. Serve with sauce from the pan.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, combine the stuffing mix, water and butter or margarine. Mix well and let stand for 5 minutes. Spoon the stuffing onto the steak, leaving a 1 inch border. Add the green onions and the red bell pepper.\nRoll from the long edge of the steak and secure with wooden toothpicks. Place steak seam side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn a separate small bowl, combine the gravy, wine OR apple juice, garlic and cheese. Mix well and pour over the steak.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, remove from oven and let stand before slicing.",
