    "des": "\"These enchiladas are a filling and flavorful recipe that will satisfy everyone, even non-vegetarians. These are best when you use really large tortilla shells and stuff them full. I love to use organic ingredients for a great flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add most of the green onions, reserving some in a bowl, red bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add tomato, black olives, and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir over low heat until tomato is soft, about 5 minutes.\nMix black beans and rice together in a large bowl. Fold in tomato mixture. Stir in cream cheese, 1 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, cilantro, lime juice, and hot sauce.\nDivide black bean mixture evenly among tortillas using a large spoon. Roll up tortillas.\nSpread a thin layer of enchilada sauce in a large, shallow baking pan. Arrange rolled tortillas seam side-down over the sauce; cover with remaining enchilada sauce. Sprinkle reserved green onions and remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on top. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve enchiladas with sour cream.",
