    "des": "\"If pineapple isn't your favorite candy flavoring you could substitute coconut, maple-flavoring or even maraschino cherries and juice for the pineapple and pineapple juice. Decorate the eggs after the chocolate has cooled if you'd like.\"",
    "ins": "In a mixing bowl, combine sugar, margarine and crushed pineapple. Stir in a small amount of pineapple juice if the mixture needs more moisture. When the mixture is well blended shape it into two 1/2 pound eggs (or a bunch of smaller eggs). Freeze for one hour.\nWhile the eggs are freezing, cut semi-sweet chocolate into small pieces and place in top of double boiler with shortening.  Melt over medium heat,  stirring frequently until smooth.  Stick a long-tined fork in top of each pineapple egg, dip it in melted chocolate to cover then drain on waxed paper.",
