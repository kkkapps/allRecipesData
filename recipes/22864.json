    "des": "\"This crust I developed after many rounds of dough.  It has become a weekly favorite! Its rosy color is from the sauce, and the chewy/crusty dough is a real treat! When baking, I like to use a pizza stone, but a perforated pan works well too.\"",
    "ins": "Pour warm water into a small bowl. Dissolve honey and yeast in water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.\nIn a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, corn flour, salt, black pepper, oregano, basil and rosemary. Add the yeast mixture, tomato sauce and olive oil; stir well to combine.\nWhen the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) place pizza stone in oven if one is to be used.\nDeflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into rounds, cover and let rest for 10 minutes.\nRoll the rounds out to crust size.  Spread crusts with desired pizza sauce from the center outward and cover with desired toppings.  Bake on preheated pizza stone or on lightly oiled pizza pans until cheese is bubbly and golden, about 12 minutes.",
