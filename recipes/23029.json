    "des": "\"This is a sweet bread that makes wonderful chicken or turkey sandwiches.  This recipe was given to me by a good friend in South Carolina that I met on the Internet. I had the pleasure of eating this bread at her beach home this spring. It makes awesome toast. We can hardly wait to cut it.\"",
    "ins": "Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the 4 tablespoons butter; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.\nPour milk mixture into bread machine pan. Add 2 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla extract, 4 cups bread flour,  yeast and salt. Choose Dough setting; press start.\nWhen dough is finished mixing,  leave it in the bread machine pan and cover with a towel. Let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.\nDeflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 brown sugar and 1/3 cup flour. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; set aside. In a separate bowl, beat together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon water.\nBrush loaves of risen bread with the egg wash and then sprinkle on crumb topping. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes, until golden brown.",
