    "des": "\"This recipe is an Ukrainian one of my Great-Grandmothers passed down from the years. They are great with melted butter and sauteed onions, or fry if desired. They can also be frozen between layers of plastic wrap.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.\nCombine flour, eggs and salt.  Mix in a little water at a time until dough is somewhat stiff.  Roll dough in small sections about 1/4 inch thick.  Using a large biscuit cutter or drinking glass, make circle cuts.\nTo make filling: Mix together potatoes, cheese, salt, pepper and onion salt.  Fill each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture, fold over and seal edges.  To cook, bring a large pot of water to boil, carefully dropping in one at a time; stir once. They are done when they float to the top.",
