    "des": "\"Our family eats a chicken every other weekend so sometimes it is challenging to find new ways of roasted chicken. This idea nailed it. Delicious, juicy, interesting. Tummies were full and my daughter even asked for second serving - VERY rare. Great with couscous, raisins, and peeled almonds as a side dish.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSprinkle chicken halves generously with salt, pepper, and cinnamon. Put chicken in a roasting pan; pour water into pan.\nRoast chicken in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.\nWhisk maple syrup, lemon juice, and chile peppers together in a bowl; brush chicken with maple syrup mixture. Pour any remaining maple syrup mixture into the pan.\nCook chicken until no longer pink at the bone, juices run clear, and skin is lightly browned, 30 to 40 more minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nBrush chicken with butter; bake until skin is crisp, 10 to 15 more minutes.",
