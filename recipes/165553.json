    "ins": "Line a 6-inch springform pan with plastic wrap, and sprinkle half of the coconut and pecans evenly onto the bottom. Beat together the cream cheese, goat cheese, honey, and cinnamon in a bowl until no lumps of cheese remain. Spread half of the cheese into the springform pan, then spread the cranberry sauce on top. Carefully spread the remaining cheese over the cranberry sauce, and sprinkle with the remaining coconut and pecans. Cover the torta with a sheet of plastic wrap, and press down firmly to pack. Refrigerate overnight before serving. Remove the springform pan and plastic wrap to serve.",
