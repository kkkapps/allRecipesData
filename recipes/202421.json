    "des": "\"This is my hub's famous peanut sauce he makes for us.  The key to this recipe is that it uses whole peanuts instead of peanut butter. It makes a world of difference in taste and texture.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour the peanuts onto a dry baking sheet in a single layer, and break the whole nuts apart into halves. Toast the peanuts until they are fragrant and slightly darker in color, 7 to 10 minutes, watching carefully so they don't burn.\nRemove peanuts from the oven, let cool, and place in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse 2 or 3 times to chop them finely, then add the canola oil, toasted sesame oil, hot chili oil, soy sauce, lime juice, sugar, and chili garlic sauce. Process until the mixture is a fine paste with a little texture of chopped peanuts, not a totally smooth paste. The sauce should look a little grainy.",
