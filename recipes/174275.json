    "des": "\"More like a relish than a true jam, this spicy delicacy will tingle your taste buds and is a great way to use a bumper crop of tomatoes and super over cream cheese with crackers!  I always get rave reviews whenever I open a jar of this jam. Use as you would a relish \u00c2\u2013 great over cream cheese served with crackers!\n\"",
    "ins": "Place the tomatoes in a large pot and pour the boiling water over the tomatoes; allow to sit 5 minutes. Remove tomatoes from boiling water and place in ice-cold water until cool enough to handle.  Slip off skins and stems.\nCoarsely chop the tomatoes in a food processor; reserve any juices and add to chopped tomatoes.\nCombine vinegar, apple juice, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, mustard, allspice, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a large non-reactive pan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar dissolves completely; stir in the chopped tomatoes. Bring the mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until liquid has reduced by half, 30 to 45 minutes. Add the lemon slices and cook another 15 minutes.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 30 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.",
