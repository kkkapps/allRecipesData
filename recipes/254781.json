    "ins": "Place potato chunks and bay leaf into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.\nCombine soy milk, vegan mayonnaise, vegan margarine, Parmesan-style topping, salt, and pepper in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals until margarine is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.\nPour soy milk mixture over potatoes in the bowl; mash until smooth with a potato masher.",
