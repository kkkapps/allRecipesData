    "des": "\"Ever since a trip to Ireland in 2001 I have wanted to recreate a leek soup I enjoyed in a small village restaurant. This is what I came up with and even my husband thinks I nailed it. My kids will eat this because it is smooth and they are not turned off by any particular ingredient.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a stock pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir leeks and celery in butter until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour chicken broth and vegetable broth into the pot; add potatoes, carrots, salt, and bay leaf.\nBring the mixture to a boil and cook until the potatoes and carrots are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf.\nBlend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Stir cream into the soup, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer soup until thickened, about 20 minutes.",
