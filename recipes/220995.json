    "des": "\"There was a time when being called a shoemaker was the ultimate kitchen insult. It meant that your cooking skills were so weak, the cobbler down the street could have come into the kitchen and done just as well. This beautiful peach cobbler recipe is so easy, any shoemaker could master it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine peaches, Chinese five-spice powder, and lemon zest in a bowl.\nStir sugar and water together in saucepan pan over medium heat until simmering, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in peach mixture; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\nCombine sugar and self-rising flour in a large bowl. Pour in milk; whisk to form a smooth batter.\nPour melted butter into a Dutch oven. Pour batter over the melted butter.\nGently place peaches and syrup on top of batter. As the cobbler bakes, they will sink down into the batter.\nBake until syrup is bubbling and crust has risen and is golden brown, about 50 minutes.",
