Cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tofu to onion mixture; cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until tofu is golden brown, about 6 minutes. Season with salt.\nMix Worcestershire sauce and lime juice into tofu mixture. Stir water and bouillon together in a bowl until dissolved; pour over tofu mixture. Bring liquid to a simmer, add papaya, loosely cover stockpot, and simmer until papaya is tender yet firm to the bite, about 20 minutes.\nRemove stockpot from heat, stir on spinach, cover, and allow to sit until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Ladle soup into serving bowls and top with fried onions.",
