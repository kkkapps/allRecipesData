Press into the bottom and a little bit up the sides of the prepared pan. Sprinkle on the chocolate chips, coconut and pecans so they are evenly distributed. Pour the condensed milk over everything.\nBake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the coconut is browned. Cool before cutting into bars. these are great frozen too.
