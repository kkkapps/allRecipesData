    "ins": "Preheat broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange Pretzel Crisps(R) on foil.\nCombine mozzarella, Parmesan, and parsley in a small bowl. Carefully top each crisp with about 1 teaspoon of the mixture. Place pan under broiler; broil until cheese is warm and beginning to melt, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch carefully so they don't burn.\nHeat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and sausage. Cook and stir until sausage is nicely browned on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nTop the cheese on each Pretzel Crisp(R) with a piece of sausage. Carefully wrap a chive around the middle of the crisp tying it into a knot. Cut off any excess chive and place on your serving platter. Serve immediately with pizza sauce for dipping.",
