    "ins": "Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, rice vinegar, lime juice, sriracha sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, mint, garlic, curry powder, brown sugar, ginger, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a large bowl to make marinade.\nPlace chicken in a separate bowl. Pour in enough marinade to thoroughly coat the chicken. Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 15 to 20 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet.\nThread chicken onto bamboo skewers, alternating with green onions. Lay skewers a few inches apart on the baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven, flipping skewers halfway through baking, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve remaining marinade alongside.",
