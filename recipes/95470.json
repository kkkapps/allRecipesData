    "des": "\"A moist carrot cake with a lemon icing. Only almonds rather than walnuts as well and no spices. Is really delicious and is the standard birthday cake in our household.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square baking dish or 9 inch Bundt pan.\nIn a large bowl, whip egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in the almonds, carrots,1 lemon's juice and zest, flour and baking powder. In a separate bowl with a clean beater, whip egg whites with a pinch of salt until they can hold a peak. Fold egg whites into the carrot batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.\nBake for 50 minutes, or until a small knife inserted into the center comes out clean. For icing, mix the remaining lemon's juice with confectioners' sugar until it can be drizzled easily from a spoon. Pour over the cake while warm or cooled. If making in a Bundt pan, remove from the pan before glazing.",
