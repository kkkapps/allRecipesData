    "des": "\"This quick broccolini dish is delicious, good for you, and full of garlicky, lemony flavor. Broccolini is more tender than broccoli and has a milder flavor. I love the mix of textures; the crunchy stems and the softer florets that soak up sauce are a great combination.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a large skillet with 1 to 2 inches of water and bring to a boil; add broccolini and cook until bright green, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer broccolini to a strainer and drain water from skillet.\nHeat olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the hot oil until golden and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Return broccolini to frying pan using tongs; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Squeeze lemon juice over broccoli and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.",
