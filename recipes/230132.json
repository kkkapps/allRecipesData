    "des": "\"After many years of experimentation, I've finally perfected what I think is the ideal formula for a rich pumpkin pie that's also much less likely to crack on top. Serve garnished with whipped cream and freshly grated nutmeg.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nWhisk together pumpkin puree, egg yolks, and egg in a large bowl until smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and Chinese 5-spice powder; whisk until thoroughly combined.\nFit pie crust in a 9-inch pie plate and crimp edges.\nPour filling into the pie shell and lightly tap on the work surface to release any air bubbles.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.\nReduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until just set in the middle, 30 to 40 more minutes. A paring knife inserted into the filling, 1 inch from the crust, should come out clean. Allow to cool completely before serving.",
