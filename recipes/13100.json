    "des": "\"A hearty soup, great for a cold, blustery March day--or any day! My husband Tom developed this recipe and got it just right on the second try. Best if cooked one day ahead, refrigerated overnight and heated just before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Place chopped cabbage into an 8-quart soup pot.\nMicrowave diced carrot in 2 tablespoons water for 6 minutes on high.\nMicrowave diced celery in 2 tablespoons water for 4 minutes on high.\nAdd the microwaved vegetables to the pot. Add minced sweet onion, celery, and ketchup. Add juice cocktail, vegetable broth, chicken broth, and tomatoes. Fill each can with water, and add the water to the mixture. Cover, and bring to a boil. Continue boiling for 30 minutes.\nReduce heat to simmer and cook for 2 to 3 hours.\nServe with slices of a French baguette. Have salt, black pepper, and Tabasco available to season to taste at the table.",
