    "des": "\"This is a potato water starter.  It requires no addition of yeast.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, cover potatoes with water. Cook over medium heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Remove potatoes and reserve for other use. Let cooking water cool to lukewarm.\nMix flour and 1 cup potato water.  Set aside in bowl with cloth or wax paper to cover.  Mixture does not have to be mixed smooth: the batter will work out any lumps as it sits.  Stir once or twice a day until it smells right.  It will have a nice sourdough smell to it after about 4 or 5 days, depending on the temperature of your kitchen.  You can add a teaspoon of sugar to quicken the process.  If you want to speed the process even more you can add a package of yeast to the water before adding the flour.  Use as directed in your favorite Sourdough Bread recipe.",
