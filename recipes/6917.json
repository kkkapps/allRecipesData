    "ins": "In a small bowl, sprinkle or crumble yeast and sugar over the lukewarm water.  Let stand for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve.  Set the bowl in a warm, draft-free place for 8 to 10 minutes, or until yeast doubles in volume.\nPulverize the cornmeal in a blender until fine.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup cornmeal, salt, and boiling water.  Stir vigorously until smooth. Stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Cool mixture to lukewarm.  Stir proofed yeast into the cornmeal mixture.  Gradually add 1/2 cup cornmeal and flour.  Gather the dough into a ball, and place it in a greased bowl.   Cover.  Set it aside in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk.\nWith a pastry brush, coat the bottom and sides of a 9 inch pie pan with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Turn the dough out into pie pan, and cover.  Let it rise in a warm place for another 30 minutes, or until it doubles in bulk again.\nBake in the middle of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven for 40 minutes, or until top is golden.  Transfer to a rack to cool.",
