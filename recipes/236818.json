    "des": "\"Fresh baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, and boiled eggs are topped with a hot bacon vinaigrette with caramelized onions. Very satisfying and earthy! This is also great topped with grape tomatoes for a little tart pop reminiscent of a nice BLT.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving about 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon.\nHeat reserved bacon drippings over medium heat; cook and stir onion in hot bacon drippings until slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes.\nCombine vegetable oil, sugar, vinegar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and salt together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar and salt are dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add bacon and onion and simmer over low heat until dressing is blended, 3 minutes.\nMix spinach, mushrooms, and eggs together in a large bowl. Pour dressing over spinach mixture; toss to coat.",
