    "ins": "Place the flour, garlic salt, and pepper into a plastic bag. Shake to mix, the add the pork tenderloin pieces, and shake again to coat. Shake off the excess flour.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the pork medallions in the hot oil until golden-brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour in the balsamic vinegar and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pork to a serving platter, then stir the lemon zest and capers into the simmering sauce. Continue simmering until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.",
