Transfer egg to a plate and return wok to heat.\nCook ginger and garlic in skillet until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add teriyaki sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes to the ginger and garlic; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook another 2 minutes.\nCrumble cold rice into the wok. Stir rice with a wooden spoon, breaking rice into individual grains as it warms; add peas, carrots, broccoli, and green onion. Cook and stir mixture until the vegetables are tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
