    "des": "\"For best results, mix your dough by hand.  Lightly oil mold  and blot with paper towel.  Lightly flour mold and  re-flour the mold before each cookie but DO NOT re-oil.  Press a piece of dough firmly and evenly into the mold.  Trim the back of the cookie so it's flush with the mold.  Tap the  dough from mold and place on a baking sheet in the top third of your oven until nicely browned - about 10 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "Thoroughly cream the butter by hand.  Add sugar and mix til fluffy.  Beat in the egg and then the milk or cream.\nIn a separate bowl mix together all the dry ingredients.  Stir them into the butter.  Knead the dough for just a minute.  Chill the dough until firm.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).\nForm the cookies as directed above.  Bake for 10 - 12 minutes or until the edges brown.  *Quantity will vary depending on the size of your ceramic molds.",
