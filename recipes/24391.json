    "des": "\"I threw this together on a cold day when I was itching for some chili. The spice measurements are approximate. I start out with 1/8 cup and go from there.  It cooks up fast and gets better when stored in the fridge and reheated. Top with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream, if desired. Enjoy!\"",

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer.\nWhile soup is heating, cook beef in a large skillet over medium heat until brown.  Drain excess fat, then stir beef into soup pot.  Simmer, covered, until flavors are well blended, about 1 hour.",
