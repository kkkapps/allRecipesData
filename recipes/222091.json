Stir flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a small bowl.\nBeat butter, yogurt, and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add egg allowing it to blend into butter mixture. Beat in vanilla extract. Mix in flour mixture until just incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2-inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Let stand on baking sheet two minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.",
