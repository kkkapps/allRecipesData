    "des": "\"Reduced calorie dip that's packed with flavor. Let the dip chill while the chips are being prepared. The consistency will be thicker and the beans will have time to absorb the spices.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a mixing bowl, mash the beans with a fork. Combine the salad dressing, sour cream, green chilies, cilantro, chili powder, garlic powder and hot pepper sauce. Blend well. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Serve with the baked tortilla chips.\nSpray the tortillas lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle lightly with salt. Bake until crisp and lightly browned.",
