    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace chicken pieces into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Melt 1/4 cup of the butter, and drizzle it over the chicken. Season with salt and pepper.\nBake chicken, uncovered, for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. While the chicken is cooking, combine the honey, molasses, mustard, curry powder and remaining butter in a medium saucepan. Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes to blend the flavors.\nWhen the 45 minutes are up on the chicken, pour the curry mixture over the pieces, and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.",
