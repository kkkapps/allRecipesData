    "des": "\"If you love your asparagus like we do, here is another way of enjoying it on the grill. The bacon has a nice mellowing effect on the sriracha and isn't spicy at all. The flavors are fantastic, and after just the first time this became an instant family favorite at our house.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nDivide asparagus into sets of 3 spears; push 1 toothpick through the asparagus bases and 1 toothpick near the tops to secure the sets.\nSpread about 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce along the entire length of each slice of bacon.\nSecure a slice of bacon to the asparagus using the toothpick at the base of the asparagus and wrap bacon, sriracha-side facing inwards, around asparagus, securing the other end of the bacon to the top toothpick; repeat with remaining bacon and asparagus. Place wrapped asparagus sets in the bottom of a disposable aluminum foil pan.\nCook on the preheated grill, turning asparagus sets occasionally, until bacon is cooked through and crisp, about 20 minutes.",
