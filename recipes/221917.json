The original dressing was made in St. Paul, Nebraska and is sold in the midwest but is becoming more expensive. This recipe is very similar to the store version and uses products I regularly have in my pantry. We love it.\"",
    "ins": "Mix tomato soup, vegetable oil, sugar, vinegar, dry mustard, salt, celery seeds, black pepper, and garlic powder in a large jar with a lid. For thicker dressing, stir in cornstarch. Serve immediately or refrigerate overnight for best flavor.",
