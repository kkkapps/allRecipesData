    "des": "\"I bake with my three-year-old at least once a week. We have tried a plethora of different cookies with different fruits and bases. This one was a hit! My three-year-old and older child both loved these, and I did too! They are super simple to make and sneak fiber, protein, and other nutrients into dessert! I used one cookie sheet for nine cookies, three rows of three fit well.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the moisture is absorbed completely, 15 to 20 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.\nMix cooked quinoa, coconut, oats, flour, brown sugar, mashed bananas, applesauce, peanut butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Fold chocolate chips into the quinoa mixture; drop by spoonful onto prepared baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until browned around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cookies to set up a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack",
