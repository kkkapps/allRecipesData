    "des": "\"In this rack of lamb recipe, we're actually roasting the meat over the sauce. And not just any sauce: we spiked this beurre rouge (red wine butter sauce) with fresh blueberries, and the small, dark fruit performed beautifully.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSeason lamb generously with salt and black pepper. Heat oil over medium-high heat in an oven-proof skillet. Sear lamb on all sides until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Turn off heat. Remove lamb to a platter.\nMix together Dijon mustard, rosemary, cinnamon, and cumin in a small bowl. Spread a thin layer of the mustard mixture on each rack of lamb.\nPlace chopped shallots and pinch of salt into the same skillet. Cook and stir over medium-heat until shallots begin to lose moisture and become browned and soft, about 5 minutes. Add blueberries and continue cooking for about 2 minutes. Stir in red wine, turn off heat, and stir mixture to deglaze the pan.\nPlace the racks of lamb into the skillet and interlace the rib bones together to push the lamb racks close together, leaving a lamb bone \"zipper\" in the center. Place the lamb racks into the center of the skillet. Season with a pinch of black pepper.\nPlace skillet in pre-heated oven and roast lamb until internal temperature reaches 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for medium-rare, about 20 minutes.\nRemove lamb to a cutting board to rest about 5 minutes.\nDrizzle balsamic vinegar into the blueberry sauce; add a pinch of salt. Turn heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer to reduce sauce by half, about 4 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in butter. When butter is melted, check seasonings and add more salt if needed.\nSlice racks into pieces of 2 ribs each. Serve topped with a spoonful of the blueberry sauce.",
