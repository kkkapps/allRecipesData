    "des": "\"We host a Kentucky Derby Party every year, and have for 10 years. When each guest arrives they are given a real Churchill Downs commemorative mint julep glass to which they then add a self-stick name tag on which they print their name. This serves as their glass, name tag, and souvenir of the party. Many still have one from each year of the party as Churchill Downs produces a new one each year!!!\"",

Remove from heat.\nStir 1 cup mint leaves into the simple syrup and allow to cool thoroughly. Pour syrup and mint leaves into a container with a lid. Mix in 1 more cup mint leaves, cover, and refrigerate mint syrup at least 4 hours or overnight.\nPour whiskey and chilled mint syrup into a large cooler or drink dispenser.\nTo serve, fill 10-ounce glasses with ice and dispense 2 to 4 ounces mint julep mixture into each glass. Top with ice water and 1 or 2 mint leaves per cocktail and stir.",
