Serve them with a slotted metal or wood spoon, using any non-plastic container. Drink the extra vodka if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Spread candies in a 3-quart baking dish, ensuring none of the candies are stuck together. Pour vodka over candies, spreading candies around and still ensuring none are stuck together. Cover mixture with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 to 6 hours.\nRemove plastic wrap from candies. Separate gummy candies from dish using a spatula or your fingers. Cover candies with a new piece of plastic wrap; refrigerate, 4 to 6 hours. Repeat process of separating candies from dish every 4 to 6 hours and replacing plastic wrap until gummies have soaked for a total of 24 hours.",
