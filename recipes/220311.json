    "des": "\"This is one my favorite green bean side dishes. It has been in my family for a very long time. It goes great with pot roast and potatoes. It's almost like a green bean relish. Not your ordinary green bean dish! Even better left over. I've also added rinsed and drained water chestnuts for some crunch.\"",
    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate, reserving about 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon.\nPreheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nCook and stir the onion in the reserved bacon drippings over medium-high heat until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.\nCombine cooked onion, sugar, cider vinegar, relish, pimento peppers, and green beans in a large bowl.\nTransfer mixture to a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove foil and stir lightly.\nAllow green beans to rest for 15 minutes before topping with crumbled bacon and serving.",
