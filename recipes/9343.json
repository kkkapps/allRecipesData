    "des": "\"A yeast-roll recipe which uses self-rising flour for the most airy, delicious rolls ever! Note: the secret to these light and airy rolls is NOT punching down the dough and NOT kneading it, plus the added lift the self-rising flour gives.\"",

Microwave about 2 minutes.\nIn another bowl, mix 1 cup sugar and eggs.\nIn a separate cup, microwave 1/2 cup water for 30 seconds.
