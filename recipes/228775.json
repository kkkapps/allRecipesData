    "des": "\"This is a specialty of my mother-in-law's. I've never seen it offered in local Italian restaurants or other homes, but I'm always asked for the recipe when I serve it. It can be served as a great side dish without the eggs as well.\"",
    "ins": "Trim artichoke stems, cut away leaves, and remove the fibrous portion at the center of the artichoke, leaving the heart. Slice the hearts.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir artichoke slices and garlic until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, mint, salt, and black pepper; continue to cook until artichoke slices are tender. Spoon a little water into skillet if juices evaporate.\nPour beaten egg into the skillet and scramble gently until egg is set and not runny, 2 or 3 minutes; serve immediately.",
