    "des": "\"Impress your guests with an attractive platter of curry-sauced shrimp skewered onto grilled pineapple wedges with toothpicks. This is an excellent, not-too-hard shrimp appetizer that's perfect for special occasions. It's best served at room temperature. I used approximately 1 pound of 30-40 count shrimp.  But any medium to large size shrimp will do.  You need approximately 30 shrimp. The shrimp and sauce may be cooked in advance and chilled.\"",
    "ins": "Grill the pineapple rings over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes each, or until they have grill marks. Remove from heat and cut each ring into approximately 5 wedges.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the flour and cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously. Pour in the coconut milk and milk. Continue stirring until thickened. Mix in curry powder, salt and pepper. Remove from heat and place shrimp into the mixture.\nArrange the pineapple wedges on a medium serving platter. Skewer each piece of shrimp with a toothpick, then insert the toothpicks into the pineapple wedges.",
