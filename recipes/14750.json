Add enough water to barely cover pork chops and top with green bell peppers. Add browning sauce, cover skillet and let all simmer for about 40 minutes, turning chops at least once.\nRemove pork chops from skillet to serving plate or platter. Thicken bell pepper sauce with flour and water, to taste. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste, pour over chops and serve immediately.",
