Season to your tastes, use more or less ingredients, make it your own. Whenever there is a summer BBQ this is what I make (because even I can't mess up on it).\"",

Spread the mayonnaise mixture over the top of the fillet. Top with green pepper and onion. Season with salt and pepper. Fold the foil around the food and seal into a packet.\nPlace fish on the preheated grill. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fish is easily flaked with a fork.",
