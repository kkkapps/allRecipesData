    "ins": "In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until softened.  Add sugar and beat until fluffy.  Add egg, vanilla and almond extract and beat well.                  \nStir together flour, baking powder and salt.     Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until well mixed.           \nDivide the dough in half and stir food coloring into one half.  Cover and chill at least 30 minutes.           \nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F.     \nOn a lightly floured surface, roll about 1/2 tablespoon of plain dough into a 6-inch rope.  Repeat with green dough.     \nPlace ropes side by side and twist together about 6 times.   Form twisted ropes into a circle and gently pinch ends together.             \n Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Repeat with remaining dough, leaving 2 inches between cookies.  Place small amount of chopped pistachios onto each wreath where ends are pinched together.     \nBake for about 10 minutes.  Cool on cookie sheet for about 1 minute. Remove and cool thoroughly on rack.     ",
