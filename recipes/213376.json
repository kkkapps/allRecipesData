    "des": "\"I make these with leftover cooked black-eyed peas cooked with ham hocks or smoked turkey from New Year's. I sometimes top with a fried green tomato or left over candied yams. Get creative with them. I've tried several variations. This is the basic version.\"",
    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nMash the black-eye peas in a bowl with a fork. Crumble the bacon into the peas, and stir in the shallot, red peppers, and enough flour to make the mixture stick together. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Form the black-eye pea mixture into 4 patties.\nMelt the butter with the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties until golden brown and crispy on each side, about 4 minutes per side.",
