    "des": "\"Easy, festive recipe for smoked salmon and caviar pasta, from a restaurant in Italy.  Uses only 4 ingredients for the sauce: cream, smoked salmon, caviar and parsley. The sauce is very rich; with a green salad, this makes a full meal.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain.\nMeanwhile, place cream in a small saucepan, over medium-low heat. Stir in the smoked salmon, and season with nutmeg and black pepper if desired. Stir frequently until thickened.\nPlace drained pasta into a large serving bowl. Pour the cream sauce over the pasta, and add the caviar. Toss gently until some of the caviar has broken and colors the pasta slightly. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of parsley.",
