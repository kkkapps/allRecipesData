I have learned to cook this dish quite happily.  At our last reunion, there were three separate bowls with different versions of this same dish; they were all scraped clean!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Blanche cabbage briefly in boiling water, remove and drain immediately.\nIn a large skillet, brown bacon over medium heat until opaque; remove and drain on paper toweling.\nRemove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon grease from the skillet; add the 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and heat over medium heat. Add onion, celery and bell pepper and saute until crisp-tender.\nIn a large bowl combine the prepared cabbage, bacon, sauteed vegetable mix (with oil), vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix well and serve warm, or chill and serve later.",
