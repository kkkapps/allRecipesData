    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.\nBeat the butter, sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the egg whites one at a time, allowing each to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Mix in the flour until just incorporated.\nDrop teaspoonfuls of the dough onto ungreased baking sheets. Spread thinly with a spatula or the back of the spoon into a 3 inch circle.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned along the edges, about 5 minutes.\nRemove the baked wafers from the baking sheet one at a time using a spatula or kitchen turner. Roll each wafer around the handle of a wooden spoon until the edges overlap. Cool seam-side down on a wire rack until completely crisp.",
