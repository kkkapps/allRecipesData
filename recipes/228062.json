    "des": "\"These are an old soul food heirloom favorite in the garden and what I remember eating frequently as a child. I grew the pole variety this summer and they are super prolific/productive. They taste like nothing you buy in a store - super meaty, tender, long-lasting flavor. And now they are a favorite in my own family. The beans will cook in this semi-salty broth, and won't be as salty as is the broth.\"",
    "ins": "Pour about 1 inch of water into a saucepan; add green beans, bacon, garlic, olive oil, sea salt, and pepper. Bring the water to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and place a cover on the saucepan. Cook beans until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.",
