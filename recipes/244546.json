They're raw, vegan, gluten-free, and fabulous. \nMaca root is a powerful superfood! \nThese little bites pack a wallop and taste phenomenal! Kind of like a cardamom-laced salted caramel snack. Enjoy!\"",

Add dates, maca powder, cardamom, and olive oil; blend until mixture is evenly combined and holds together.\nShape mixture into 10 to 12 balls and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes.",
