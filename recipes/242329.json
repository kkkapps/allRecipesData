    "ins": "Stir orange juice, lemon juice, lemon zest, ginger, and soy sauce together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add swai fillets, coat with the liquid, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.\nRemove fillets from marinade and shake to remove excess moisture. Discard remaining marinade. Season fish with salt and pepper.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry fish in hot oil until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side.",
