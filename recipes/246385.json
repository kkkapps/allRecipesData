    "des": "\"Homemade corned beef is brined, smoked, then braised to perfection. Juicy, tender and full of flavor with just a few steps. It is easier than you think! Makes delicious Reuben sandwiches! Divide slices into half-pound portions and freeze, leaving only what you will use over the next few days unfrozen.\"",
    "ins": "Place water, 3 bottles beer, 2 onions, kosher salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar, curing salt, 1/4 cup pickling spice, and 2 tablespoons garlic in a very large pot. Stir well until salts are dissolved. Add beef; stir gently. Use a large bowl or heavy plate to keep the beef submerged. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring once a day, for 4 days.\nSoak wood chips in apple juice for 2 hours.\nRemove beef from pot, discarding brine, and rinse well until cold water. Let beef come to room temperature.\nPreheat an outdoor grill to 150 to 175 degrees F (65 to 80 degrees C). Place soaked wood chips in a shallow aluminum pan on the heat source.\nPlace meat directly on the grate and allow to smoke for 2 hours.\nCombine 1 beer, 1 onion, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons pickling spice, 2 tablespoons chopped garlic, and black pepper in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and pour into a large roasting pan. Place beef in braising liquid in the roasting pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil.\nIncrease grill temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place the roasting pan on the grill and close the lid.\nRoast the beef until tender, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (60 degrees C).\nRemove beef from the roasting pan, discarding braising liquid. Let beef cool until easily handled.\nSlice beef into very thin slices across the grain.",
