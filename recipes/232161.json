Lightly grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R).\nCombine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.\nPlace butter and sugar in a blender; process until sugar is almost completely dissolved; pour into a bowl. Stir in mashed bananas and egg until well blended; pour banana mixture into flour mixture and stir until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared tube pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting cake onto a plate to serve.",
