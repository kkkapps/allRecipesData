    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.\nPlace cinnamon roll dough on a work surface; cut each roll in half and flatten. Center 1 piece of cream cheese on each piece of dough. Roll into balls, pinching edges to seal in the cream cheese. Place dough balls over the bottom of the prepared pan. Sprinkle butter pieces on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing monkey bread from the pan. Drizzle with the prepared icing and serve warm.",
