Grease two 9-inch round cake pans.\nStir lemon cake mix, orange juice, water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a bowl to moisten; beat with an electric mixer on low for 30 seconds. Increase mixer speed to medium and beat for 2 more minutes. Gently fold in blueberries, orange zest, and lemon zest. Divide batter into prepared cake pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until cakes spring back when lightly pressed with a finger and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool thoroughly before frosting.",
