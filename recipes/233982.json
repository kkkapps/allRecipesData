    "des": "\"This recipe is based on the sloppy joes I loved as a kid. My own kids don't eat enough veggies, so I added them to this recipe and they pass the kid-approved test. This recipe was entered in our school's cookbook and has been a big hit for a quick weeknight supper. Equally tasty with ground turkey.\"",

Return skillet to heat.\nStir onion, bell pepper, celery, and carrot into the ground beef; cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes; add chicken gumbo soup, chili sauce, yellow mustard, and onion salt. Reduce heat to medium-low, stir beef mixture, and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.",
