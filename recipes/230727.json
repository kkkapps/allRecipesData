    "des": "\"This light, colorful, and fresh pasta salad that everyone will love is great for get-togethers! Easy to reduce calories by using light mayo and light sour cream. If you make this the night before, add a little water and toss again to 'rejuvenate' before serving the next day.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until cool; drain. Transfer pasta to a large bowl.\nStir cucumber, black olives, red onion, mayonnaise, sour cream, dill, salt, dry mustard, and garlic salt together in a bowl; pour over the pasta and gently mix to coat evenly.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.",
