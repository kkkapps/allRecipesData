    "des": "\"The rich texture of challah bread makes the stuffing something to kvell over. Use this stuffing in your favorite stuffed chicken or turkey recipe. It's so good, there'll be no leftovers -- so make some extra for outside the bird. Thanks, Granny, for passing down this family recipe. \"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a skillet, and cook and stir the chopped onion until translucent, about 10 minutes. Set the onion aside to cool.\nPreheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch glass baking dish.\nFill a bowl with warm water, and soak the challah, one slice at a time. Gently squeeze out the excess water, and place the challah in a large bowl. Mix in the cooked onion, carrots, and celery, and gently mix in the eggs. Season with salt and pepper.\nSpread stuffing in the prepared baking dish, cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and set, about 1 hour.",
