    "des": "\"I make this hearty soup using the ham bone from our Easter spiral ham.  I serve it with corn muffins and fresh fruit.  It makes a huge pot of soup, so invite some friends or just freeze several portions for later use.  Remember to soak the beans the night before you make the soup.\"",
    "ins": "Place the soaked beans into a large pot and fill with enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low for 30 minutes. Drain. Add the ham bone, ham, onion, celery, carrots, tomatoes, vegetable juice, and vegetable broth. Season with Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, chili powder, bay leaves, pepper, parsley and lemon juice. Pour in enough of the chicken broth to cover the ingredients.\nSimmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 8 hours. Add more chicken broth as needed throughout the day. Remove the ham bone and season with salt if needed. Continue to simmer for a couple more hours. Remove bay leaves before serving.",
