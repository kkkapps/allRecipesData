    "ins": "Combine chicken pieces, pesto, and lemon juice in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag; seal bag and toss to coat evenly. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.\nThread chicken, tomatoes, and onion alternately onto skewers. Season with salt and pepper.\nPreheat Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to Medium-High on the \"Grill\" setting.\nPlace the skewers into the grill pan and set the timer for 3 minutes.\nTurn skewers and cook another 3 to 4 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nAllow to rest for about 5 minutes.",
