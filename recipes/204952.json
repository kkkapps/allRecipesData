    "des": "\"This is a Southern California version of sweet and sour chicken, marinated and grilled with a little extra spice. Great for all barbeque lovers. I usually serve cut into lengths with fresh cilantro, homemade salsa, guacamole, black beans, and flour tortillas warmed on the grill. A little good Southern California karma never hurts anyone. This recipe is light enough to offset the first 2 margaritas. GO CHARGERS!!!\"",
    "ins": "Stir the orange zest, orange juice, lemon zest, lemon juice, lime zest, lime juice, coriander, red pepper flakes, olive oil, and honey together in a shallow dish. Remove about 1/4 cup of the mixture and set aside for later. Add the chicken breasts to the remaining marinade, turning to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, turning occasionally, 1 to 4 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade; discard the marinade.\nBasting frequently with the reserved sauce, cook the chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
