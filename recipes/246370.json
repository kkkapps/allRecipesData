    "des": "\"Uncle Lucky and Aunt Bert's fruitcake cookies are a Virginian Christmas tradition. The cookies will soften and the flavour will mature when stored. The longer the cookies sit, the more the flavour will develop. They also freeze well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nPlace raisins, candied cherries, dates, and candied pineapple in a bowl; stir in 1/2 cup bourbon whiskey; set aside to soak.\nBeat butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture; beat in vanilla extract and cinnamon with last egg.\nStir pecans and fruit mixture into butter mixture; stir in self-rising flour alternately with remaining bourbon whiskey as needed to form a soft dough. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven just until cookies begin to look dry, about 30 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack; store in a sealed container lined with waxed paper.",
