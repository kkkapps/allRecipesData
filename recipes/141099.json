    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nCut several slits into the fatty skin of the duck breast.  In a skillet over medium heat, fry skin-side-down for 10 minutes.

Carefully remove skin using a sharp knife, then slice, and set aside.\nMeanwhile, in a separate skillet, cook onions in olive oil over medium heat until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes.  Mix in honey and continue to cook until brown and fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes more.\nSpread goat cheese evenly over pizza crust and season with salt and pepper. Then layer with caramelized onions, fontina cheese, duck breast slices and rosemary.\nBake in preheated oven until cheese in center of pizza is completely melted, about 10 minutes.",
