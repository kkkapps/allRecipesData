    "des": "\"I made this up one night with garlic mashed potatoes and my husband made me swear to include it in the rotation. It originated from a marinade my mother had for moose meat, but the lime and chili garlic sauce adds a fresh twist. Warning: I didn't measure; it's all approximations to your taste!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, cane sugar, lime juice, lime zest, green onion, garlic, ground ginger, and chile-garlic sauce together in a large glass or ceramic bowl; add the sliced pork and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.\nRemove pork from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard marinade.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork slices in oil until no longer pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
