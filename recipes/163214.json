    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch loaf pan with aluminum foil.\nMelt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and shallots; cook and stir until the shallot has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a mixing bowl, and set aside to cool. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chanterelles, and cook until the mushrooms are tender and golden around the edges, about 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley, and cook for 30 seconds more, then scrape the mushrooms into the mixing bowl, and allow to cool for 5 minutes.\nMix the ground pork, egg whites, salt, and pepper into the mushroom mixture with your hands until evenly blended. Stir in the cream until absorbed by the pork mixture. Line the bottom and sides of the loaf pan with the smoked ham. Pack the meat mixture into the loaf pan and flatten the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until the pate is no longer pink in the center, and has reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (72 degrees C), about 1 hour. Serve hot or cold in slices.",
