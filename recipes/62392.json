    "des": "\"This is great way to use extra apricots, especially when your tree gives a bumper crop. Apricots are very nutritious so you don't want to waste them and this makes a great snack. These will also keep for a long time.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 150 degrees F (165 degrees C), or the lowest setting you have.\nCombine the lemon juice, apricots and sugar in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until sugar has dissolved. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth.\nCover an 11x17 inch pan or cookie sheet with a layer of plastic wrap. Pour the pureed fruit onto the plastic and spread evenly to within 1 inch of the edge.\nBake for 4 to 6 hours in the preheated oven, using a spoon or a pair of tongs to keep the door slightly ajar, or until the puree has dried and is no longer sticky. Once dry, you can cut it into strips and store in an airtight container.",
