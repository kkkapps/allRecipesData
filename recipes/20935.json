    "des": "\"This is a scrumptious casserole of bread, cream cheese, eggs, and milk. Tastes just like regular French toast but it's made the night before and baked in the oven. This is not really sweet so you might like more maple syrup with it.\"",
    "ins": "Place bread cubes in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan.\nIn a large bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in milk, half and half, maple syrup, and vanilla until mixture is smooth. Pour cream cheese mixture over the bread; cover, and refrigerate overnight.\nThe next morning, remove souffle from refrigerator, and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile,  preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake, uncovered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, and serve warm.",
