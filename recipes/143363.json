    "des": "\"This recipe uses red bell peppers, black pepper, dried chile pepper and lots of Parmesan cheese, but less basil than most pesto recipes.  The predominant flavor is sweet red pepper.  It's excellent toasted with bread under the broiler or  tossed with pasta. The pesto keeps up to 3 days in the refrigerator.\"",
    "ins": "Place the Parmesan cheese and olive oil in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Add the red bell pepper, basil, red pepper flakes, and black pepper; blend again until smooth.",
