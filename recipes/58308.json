Mix together the condensed soup, milk and butter; pour over the ingredients in the dish. Layer in the cheddar cheese, cubed ham and mushrooms. Dot with cream cheese cubes, and sprinkle with dried chives.\nBake uncovered for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Sprinkle the French fried onions over the top, and return to the oven for an additional 15 minutes, or until browned.",
