    "des": "\"This delicious and healthy shake can conquer any sweet tooth without guilt. Great for extinguishing the fire in your mouth after eating hot curries! Use Indian mangoes, preferably Alphonso or another sweet Indian cultivar. These are the orange ones, not the red and green South American variety.\n\"",
