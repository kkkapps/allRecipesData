    "des": "\"I have not translated the name of this little Portuguese-Brazilian pastry because there is not an English equivalent, at least that I know. The translation would be 'good bite.' \nIt is a dessert that brings up childhood memories; my mom would always make it! \nIt's very easy and quick to make.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini cupcake mold with butter and coat with sugar.\nMix condensed milk, shredded coconut, eggs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl until combined. Pour coconut mixture into prepared cupcake mold, filling each cup to 3/4 full.\nPlace cupcake mold into a roasting pan about 1 inch larger than the cupcake mold. Pour hot tap water into the roasting pan until it is halfway up the sides of the cupcake mold, about 1 inch.\nBake in the preheated oven until the coconut mixture is golden brown, about 10 minutes.\nCool on a wire rack until the custard can easily be removed from the mold. Place custards into mini paper muffin cup liners.\nRefrigerate until chilled.",
