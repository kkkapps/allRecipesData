Add cilantro and chicken broth; whirl to blend.\nPour pepper mixture into a 10 inch frying pan.  Stir over high heat until boiling.  Reduce heat to keep warm.\nCook pasta in 3 quarts boiling water until tender to bite, about 7 minutes.  Drain, and return to pan.\nStir juices from the baked salmon into red pepper sauce.  Mix 1 1/2 cups sauce with pasta.  Spoon pasta onto plates.  Top with fish, and drizzle with remaining sauce.  Serve.",
