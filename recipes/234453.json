    "des": "\"This is a great and tasty recipe I'm sure you will enjoy. Check seasonings to taste. This has a heavy garlic and wine taste. When using a cooking wine do not add salt because there's salt already in the cooking wine. You can try sherry in place of the white wine. Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook anchovies in the skillet until they dissolve into the oil, about 5 minutes; add garlic and continue cooking until it is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Melt butter into the anchovies mixture. When the butter begins to bubble, stir parsley, oregano, red pepper flakes, and black pepper into the butter mixture; cook to soften the parsley, about 1 minute.\nPour wine and about 3/4 of the reserved clam juice into the skillet. Place a cover on the skillet and reduce heat to medium-low. Bring liquid to a simmer; add clams and continue to cook until the clams are heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour clam sauce over linguine to serve.",
