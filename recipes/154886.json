    "des": "\"I wanted a pancake and sausage casserole for deer camp and at home, too, since we have a good-sized family. I wanted to have something that would be ready for everyone to sit and eat together. I couldn't find one, so I began experimenting. Finally, I am satisfied with this one. All of my tasters agreed it worked. Top it with butter, syrup, or your favorite topping.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking dish with cooking spray. Preheat the baking dish in the oven.\nBrown the sausage in a skillet over medium heat; drain.\nMix the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla to form a batter. Add the sausage and stir. Pour into the preheated baking dish.\nBake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the dish comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool 10 minutes before cutting to serve.",
