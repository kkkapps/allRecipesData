Stir in the buttermilk until the dough holds together.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thick.  Cut into 4-inch squares, then cut each square diagonally into triangles, and prick with a fork.\nBake the triangles in preheated oven on ungreased cookie sheets until dry and lightly browned, about 10 minutes.",
