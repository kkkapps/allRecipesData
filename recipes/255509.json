    "des": "\"This is by far the best cranberry dish of any type that I've ever tasted. It was passed on to me from my mother-in-law. The garlic adds a hint of savoriness and the fresh ginger gives it a spicy kick. A very easy recipe with a sophisticated flavor. I could not find another cranberry chutney recipe exactly like it anywhere on the web, so I am sharing it here! The flavor gets better the longer it sits, so making it a day or two ahead is preferable.\"",
    "ins": "Combine water, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large pot; stir until sugars dissolve. Add cranberries, onion, dates, raisins, vinegar, ginger, cinnamon, salt, garlic, and cloves. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.\nReduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the cranberries have burst and sauce begins to thicken, about 15 minutes.\nPour into a large bowl and refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes.",
