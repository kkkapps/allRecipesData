On one half, press a worm into the indentation.  Take the rest of the halves and press them onto the wormed ones so they are once again balls.  Smooth edges.\nBake as called for in the recipe.\nServe and pretend they are regular cookies.  Laugh out loud when you see the look on you spouse's and children's faces!!",
