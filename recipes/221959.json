    "des": "\"This is a potato pizza with pesto, red onions, feta and much, much more. While it may sound odd on paper, it's quite delicious, and makes a good case for exceptions to the no starch-with-starch rule. Besides, it was a request from my mother-in-law, so what could I say?\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nScrub and dry potatoes, then prick several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove, cool, and cut into slices about 1/4-inch thick.\nSprinkle cornmeal over a half sheet pan. Stretch pizza dough over cornmeal to fit the pan; spread pesto sauce over dough.\nLay potatoes over the pesto in a single layer; season with salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over potatoes. Sprinkle Fontina cheese, red onion slices, and feta cheese on top.\nBake in the preheated oven on the bottom rack for 10 minutes. Transfer pan to the middle rack and bake until crust is light golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.",
