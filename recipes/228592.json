    "des": "\"Quiche works very well. Add seasonings of your family's choice for more variety. Use ham, bacon, or whatever protein. This quiche needs flavor boosters, so use your spice cabinet. Easily make this a Tex-Mex dish with diced green chiles and a touch of cumin. You could also add crumbled freshly cooked bacon to add more flavor. I served this with sliced avocado and tomatoes for a perfect light dinner.\"",
