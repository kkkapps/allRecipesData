    "ins": "Cut bones and fat from pork chop and cut meat into small pieces. Place bone, fat, and meat in a saucepan; add water, onion, chicken base, and garlic. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer, adding more water every hour, 5 to 6 hours.\nStrain broth into a bowl and separate bones from the meat. Put meat and 1/2 of the broth in a blender; blend. Return blended broth to broth in saucepan and mix well.",
