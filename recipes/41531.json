    "ins": "Set asparagus spears onto paper towels to absorb excess liquid. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, onion and seasoning salt. Remove crusts from bread slices, and spread mayonnaise mixture thinly on each slice. Place a spear onto the slice and roll up. Cut each roll in half, and arrange on a serving tray. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until serving.",
