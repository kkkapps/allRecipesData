    "des": "\"This cake is the one my mother is preparing like a chef! It is really simple but excellent. You cannot fail it. Good luck and degustez avec bon! (The cake will look dark orange so if you use black decoration on it, it is a perfect Halloween dessert).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the vegetable oil, sugar and eggs. Stir in yogurt and orange zest. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the mixture just until blended. Pour the dough into a greased 9x13 inch baking pan.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the cake comes out clean. Poke holes in the cake with a knife, and pour the juice from the oranges over the cake slowly until it has all been absorbed.",
