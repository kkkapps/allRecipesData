    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine corn kernels, bell pepper, onion, and cornstarch in a bowl; set aside.\nSprinkle the Creole seasoning over the red snapper. Dredge the fish in the flour, then dip them in the egg whites. Coat both sides of the fish by pressing the corn mixture into the egg whites.\nHeat the vegetable oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high eat. Arrange the fillets in the skillet and fry until golden, about 5 minutes on each side. Place the skillet in the preheated oven and continue cooking until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 more minutes.",
