    "des": "\"This salmon recipe which was given by my mother is out of this world. Even my husband who hates salmon will eat this. This marinade is also very good on chicken breasts.\"",
    "ins": "In a large resealable bag, combine the apple juice, maple syrup, soy sauce, onion and garlic. Remove 1/2 cup of the mixture and set aside in a separate bowl for basting. Place the salmon fillets in the bag and seal. Refrigerate, turning occasionally for 3 hours to marinate.\nPreheat a grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.\nPlace fish fillets on the grill and discard the bag with the marinade. Grill for 5 to 10 minutes per side depending on thickness, basting occasionally with the reserved marinade.",
