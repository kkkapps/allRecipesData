    "des": "\"A yummy dish I came up with over a batch of spinach artichoke dip. Serve over hot pasta immediately with French bread. If you prefer a pasta sauce that is not so chunky, process artichokes in food processor. Instead of a 1/2 cup of water use 1 cup water or add a second jar of Alfredo sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Puree spinach in food processor until smooth.\nWhisk spinach, Alfredo sauce, artichoke hearts, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, garlic, and tomato together in a pot.\nPour water into Alfredo sauce jar and top with lid. Shake water in jar to release last remnants of Alfredo sauce, and stir into pot with Alfredo sauce mixture.\nCook Alfredo sauce mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until cheeses have melted and sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.",
