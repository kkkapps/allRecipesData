    "des": "\"What's more Southern than grits? My own version of a dish that is a house specialty at a restaurant in the Florida Panhandle. I've tweaked the original recipe, and I think this version is even better than the original! You can use either yellow or white grits, but the yellow ones make a more attractive presentation.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add sausage, ham and bacon; cook and stir until browned. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside. Reserve 2 tablespoons of grease in the pan.\nReturn the pan to medium heat and add the onion, bell pepper, tomatoes and garlic powder. Cook and stir until onion is tender. Pour in the water and season with Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt and hot pepper sauce; bring to a boil.\nGradually stir in the grits, cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture is thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Return the meat to the pot and stir in cheese. Heat through until cheese is melted.",
