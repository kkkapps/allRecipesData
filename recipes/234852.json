    "des": "\"Combines the best of autumn flavors in one hearty low-budget mashup, with the ease of a slow cooker meal. Makes the house smell wonderful while it is cooking. Tastes great. Is warm and filling while still being relatively healthy. The recipe is for slightly more than one serving. If making for more than one person, multiply all ingredients except for the water and tea bag.\"",
