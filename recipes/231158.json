    "des": "\"A simple, slightly sweet corn bread made in the versatile cast-iron skillet. Tastes great and is a good base recipe to experiment with. Cast-iron skillets take a little bit of time to warm up.  Pre-warming the skillet allows the corn bread to cook evenly.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place 9-inch cast-iron skillet in oven to warm it.\nMix milk and cornmeal together in small bowl and let soak for 10 minutes.\nSift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Beat cornmeal mixture, eggs, and butter into the flour mixture until you have a smooth batter, about 1 minute.\nRemove skillet from oven. Swish vegetable oil in the skillet to coat; pour off excess.\nPour batter into the skillet.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 23 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve.",
