    "des": "\"A decadent Dutch cake that's super easy to stir up and a perfect complement to a cup of tea or coffee.  It's actually more like a soft cookie than a cake but definitely delicious nonetheless.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch round cake pan or pie plate.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the butter, sugar and almond extract until light and fluffy using an electric mixer. Blend in the egg. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the mixture using a sturdy spoon until dough forms a ball. Press the dough into the prepared pan.\nBake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is light golden brown. When cool, slice into wedges to serve.",
