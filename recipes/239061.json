    "des": "\"This simple recipe makes a great salmon glaze. The sugar in the seasoned rice vinegar caramelizes under the broiler and the sweet, salty vinegar works perfectly with the tangy mustard. While my original recipe only had two ingredients, I've added Sriracha hot sauce and a pinch of salt.\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and rub with vegetable oil.\nStir mustard, vinegar, Sriracha sauce, and salt together in a bowl until glaze is smooth.\nLay salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Brush fillets with mustard glaze.\nCook in the preheated oven until salmon is golden and flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 8 minutes.",
