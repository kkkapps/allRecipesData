    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain.\nHeat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef, seasoning with salt and pepper, until no longer pink in the center, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain; reserve drippings in the skillet.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Pour chicken broth, chicken soup, sour cream, cheese, rosemary, and thyme into the skillet. Cook and stir, seasoning with salt and pepper, until well combined and the cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the egg noodles and ground beef; cook until evenly mixed, 3 to 5 minutes.",
