    "des": "\"Delicious and easy Swiss steak recipe that will have you out of the kitchen in under 20 minutes. I love to pair this with egg noodles or rice, being sure to get a good spoonful of sauce along with the steak. Feel free to add celery, green pepper, carrots, or your favorite vegetable. My husband isn't a fan of celery or green pepper, so I keep my Swiss steak simple.\"",
    "ins": "Mix flour, salt, mustard, and pepper together in a wide, shallow bowl.\nDredge cube steaks in the flour mixture to coat completely.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry steaks until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side; transfer to a slow cooker, reserving drippings in the skillet.\nSaute onion and garlic in the reserved drippings in the skillet until softened, 2 to 3 minutes more; add to the slow cooker. Discard the oil.\nStir beef broth and tomato paste together in a bowl until the paste dissolves into the broth; add tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, thyme, and oregano. Pour the broth mixture over the steaks in the slow cooker.\nCook on Low until the meat is tender to the point of falling apart, 6 to 8 hours.",
