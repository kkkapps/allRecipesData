    "des": "\"With rotisserie chickens so readily available, it's easy to buy a pre-roasted bird and pull the meat off the bones for use in recipes that would otherwise likely be too complicated for a weeknight meal. A little shredding and chopping is all it takes to serve up this delicious Thai-flavored chicken salad.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix chicken, celery, green onions and peanuts. In a small bowl, whisk lime juice, fish sauce, ginger, sugar, red pepper, cilantro and mint, plus 2 Tbs. water.\nToss dressing with chicken mixture and serve on a bed of Boston lettuce with the suggested accompaniments.",
