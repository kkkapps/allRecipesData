    "des": "\"I love leftovers and especially during our Hewfit challenge I am hungry more often. Last night I made chicken scarpiello and packed up the extra chicken and chicken sausage and made this dish. I will share a recipe for you to cook up chicken if you don't have leftovers handy. Actually, go and pick up a rotisserie chicken. That would be super easy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPlace chicken thighs and sausage links on the baking sheet. Season chicken lightly with salt and pepper.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. Cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes. Pull chicken apart. Slice sausage links.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add broccoli; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, cherry peppers, jalapeno pepper, and garlic; cook until tomatoes soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in chicken and sausage slices.\nCut yellow squash into noodles using a spiralizer. Add to the skillet. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over squash; toss with tongs until heated through, about 1 minute. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Melt butter on top.",
