    "des": "\"Oh my god! is my first reaction.  I love chicken saltimbocca but it's something you need to make and eat immediately. I decided to make it an entire day in advance and this was simply amazing. \n\nMy husband does not like the word meatloaf! However, every time I make him one he loves it, including this recipe. I used all of the ingredients as my chicken saltimbocca but used ground chicken. Enjoy this delicious paleo dish today (or tomorrow). You can make just 1 loaf or up to 4 mini loaves! You pick.\"",
    "ins": "Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and spinach; toss until almost wilted, about 1 minute. Stir in garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until just combined, about 30 seconds. Transfer cooked spinach to a bowl.\nCook prosciutto in the same skillet over medium heat, breaking apart with tongs, until brown but not crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from skillet and place in a small bowl.\nMelt butter in the skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove and place mushrooms in a bowl.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine ground chicken, almond meal, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl using a fork. Mix by hand and divide the mixture in half. Flatten each portion to 1/2-inch thickness by pressing down with the palm of your hand. Top with cooked spinach and prosciutto. Roll each portion into a loaf, sealing the spinach and prosciutto inside.\nGrease the skillet with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add meat loaves.\nPlace skillet in the preheated oven and bake until meat loaves are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nWhisk chicken broth and arrowroot powder together in a large glass measuring cup. Microwave for 2 minutes. Remove skillet from the oven and pour in the broth and cooked mushrooms. Continue baking until liquid is reduced, about 15 minutes.",
