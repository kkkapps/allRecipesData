    "des": "\"Rouladen is a German dish that is made by wrapping thin slices of beef around a mixture of onion, pickle and bacon and then braised. In this recipe, which my German friend makes, the more traditional filling is replaced with a mushroom one.  Serve with egg noodles, rice or mashed potatoes and mixed seasonal vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Stir in garlic and mushrooms.  Cook until the mushrooms have softened, then stir in dried thyme, remove from heat, and allow to cool to room temperature.  Once cool, season to taste with salt and pepper, then mix in the beaten egg and breadcrumbs.\nEvenly divide the mushroom mixture among the top round slices.  Roll each Rouladen around the filling into a tight cylinder and secure with a toothpick.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Brown the Rouladen, then transfer to a 8x8 inch baking dish.  Pour wine into the hot skillet and bring to a simmer.  Meanwhile, stir the beef stock into the flour, and mix until smooth.  Pour the beef stock into the skillet and return to a simmer.  Cook until thickened, then stir in the Dijon mustard.  Pour this sauce over the Rouladen.\nCover, and bake 60 to 75 minutes in the preheated oven, until the meat is tender.",
