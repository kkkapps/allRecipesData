    "des": "\"This cake often appeared on the Sunday dinner table during the depression and the war years. It's been in my family for three generations. During the olden days, many families could not afford the luxury of the traditional fruitcakes, so this recipe became the popular Christmas fruitcake of the poor.\"",
