Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; add to butter mixture, and stir until just blended. With a large wooden spoon, stir in the white, milk, and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Stir in the walnuts, pecans, and almonds. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven.
