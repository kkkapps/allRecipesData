    "des": "\"My grandmother used this recipe at her summer resort. Preparation of vegetables is very important. All vegetables should be thinly shaved with large knife. She used to cook these burgers and people would come from miles to eat at her kitchen and then go fishing.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill to high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nDivide the ground beef into 4 balls, and flatten into patties between sheets of waxed paper. Lay patties onto the grate of the prepared grill. Sprinkle the tops of the burgers with salt. Grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness.\nWhile the burgers are cooking, spread each top bun with 1 teaspoon of butter, and spread each bottom bun with 1 teaspoon of mustard. Place the buns onto the grill for just a minute to toast.\nAssemble the burgers in this order: Bun, onion, burger patty, cheese, tomato, lettuce, a pinch of salt, and top bun. Spread mayonnaise onto top bun if using.",
