    "des": "\"From Real Women of Philadelphia 2010 Host Caryn Ross:  Hawaiian bread rolls provide a subtly sweet contrast to the savory flavors of ham and PHILADELPHIA Chive and Onion Cream Cheese. The sandwiches are melt-in-your-mouth good after they come out of the oven.\"",
    "ins": "Cut all rolls in half. Place roll bottoms in 9x13-inch pan.\nPlace equal amounts of ham on each roll bottom. Top with Gruyere.\nOn each of the roll tops, spread a generous amount of the cream cheese spread. Return the tops to the bottoms making sandwiches.\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the butter, Worcestershire sauce, onion and Parmesan cheese. Pour over your sandwiches and let sit for at least 20 minutes. (You can make these ahead of time and allow to sit in fridge overnight.)\nPlace sandwiches, covered in foil, in a preheated 350 degrees F oven. Bake for 20 minutes or until warmed through. Enjoy!",
