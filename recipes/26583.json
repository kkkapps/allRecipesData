    "des": "\"This rump roast in mushroom soup and beef broth is tender and very moist. It's made in the slow cooker, and is very easy to make. Raw vegetables, such as carrots and potatoes, may be added at the start of the cooking time, if desired. My whole family loves this recipe. The leftovers also make great roast beef sandwiches.\"",
