    "ins": "Stir together the tomatoes, basil, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and oregano in a bowl; allow mixture to stand at least 10 minutes.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the tagliatelle pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Mix the hot cooked tagliatelle into the tomato mixture; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.",
