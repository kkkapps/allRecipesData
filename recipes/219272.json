    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover; stir in salt. Bring the water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes, and set aside.\nStir the cornstarch and kirsch liqueur together in a small bowl until it forms a paste; set aside.\nCombine the white wine and garlic in a large saucepan over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Slowly whisk in the Emmentaler and Gruyere cheese, about 1/2 cup at a time, allowing each batch to melt before mixing in the next. Stir in a random pattern to prevent cheese from clumping into a ball. Whisk in cornstarch mixture and nutmeg to the cheese sauce; stir and cook at a simmer until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.\nTransfer the cheese mixture to a fondue pot. Serve with the cooked red potatoes and French bread for dipping; garnish with pearl onions and cornichons.",
