    "des": "\"Well, I love apple crisps and rhubarb crisp - but didn't like the strawberry. I took a few recipes I found and mixed and matched and got something that everyone loved. Hope you do as well. Apples-to-rhubarb mixture can be tweaked depending on how much you like rhubarb or how tall you want the crisp to be.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nMix apples, rhubarb, 1 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl until thoroughly combined; spread fruit mixture into bottom of prepared baking dish.\nMix quick oats, 1 1/2 cup flour, and brown sugar in a separate bowl; cut butter into the oats mixture until crumbly. Spread the oats mixture evenly over the fruit mixture. If desired, combine 2 tablespoons white sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the top of the crisp.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fruit is bubbling and thick and the topping is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let cool 10 to 15 minutes; best served warm.",
