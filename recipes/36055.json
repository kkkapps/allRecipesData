    "des": "\"My parent's friend's daughter introduced me to this one. She said she made it when she was in Girl Scouts. It's an interesting twist on roasting marshmallows not to mention what they add to s'mores!!  Careful, the caramel is extremely hot when done.\"",
    "ins": "Build a nice fire and let the wood burn down into coals. This takes about an hour.\nThread a marshmallow onto a stick, then thread a caramel candy onto the stick in front of the marshmallow. Roast over the coals from the fire until the marshmallow is the desired doneness, but not on fire. Pull the marshmallow up over the caramel so that it is inside. Let cool and enjoy!",
