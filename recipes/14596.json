    "ins": "Blanch the bacon for 1 minute in boiling water. Drain.\nPlace bacon and butter or margarine in a large covered pot or Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat until bacon is browned.  Add onions; cook until golden.  Add garlic, and cook for 1 or 2 minutes; take care not to burn the garlic.  Remove bacon mixture from pot, and set aside.\nAdd beef to the fat left in the pot, and brown on all sides. When meat is browned, return bacon mixture  to the pot.  Stir in  flour, salt, and pepper.  Add enough beer to just barely cover the meat.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cover.  Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nRemove pot from heat, and stir in parsley, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Serve hot.",
