    "des": "\"These appetizers are easy to make and very addictive. I have converted tomato-haters to lovers of these BLT cups. I love that they can be made ahead of time and then a quick spoonful in a cup to serve. You can never make too many - they will fly in a second. The BLT mix can be made in advance and kept refrigerated. Remove from fridge 1/2 hour before serving. You can use butter instead of olive oil, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 40 mini muffin cups with olive oil.\nPress 1 wonton wrapper into each prepared muffin cup, pressing wonton against the bottom and sides of the cup.\nBake in the preheated oven until crisped and corners are browned, about 4 minutes. Cool.\nStir bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, and honey mustard together in a bowl until well-combined. Fill each wonton with bacon mixture and top each with green onion.",
