    "des": "\"This recipe is a family favorite. It is great for using overripe bananas. I usually double the recipe and make two loaves. You can also add walnuts if you wish. Note: When your bananas are overripe, you can put them in the freezer until you are ready to use them.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 5x9-inch loaf pan.\nMash bananas and add flour, sugar, butter, vanilla, baking powder, baking soda and egg. Mix well. Pour into loaf pan.\nBake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.",
