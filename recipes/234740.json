    "des": "\"This way of cooking cauliflower is an excellent substitute for most rice dishes for those looking to add more veggies and cut back on grain. Cauliflower is mild and is a great compliment to the Mediterranean flavors of lemon and mint. The recipe is both SCD and paleo diet-friendly. We served this underneath grilled lamb kabobs. It was a big hit!\"",
