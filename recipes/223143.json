    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nMix flour, salt, and baking soda in a bowl.\nBeat the butter, brown sugar, flax seed, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in one egg until completely incorporated. Beat in the last egg along with the vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Fold oats and butterscotch chips into the dough just enough to evenly combine; drop by ice cream scoop or heaping spoonfuls onto baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheets for 3 minutes before transferring to cooling rack to cool completely.",
