    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Turn off heat and drop in rice noodles. Allow them to soften, about 10 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander and set aside.\nWhisk together fish sauce, honey, soy sauce, lime juice, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, ketchup, chili oil, sesame oil, and garlic in a bowl.\nHeat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and scramble eggs. Remove and set aside.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shrimp until pink but not opaque, 3 to 4 minutes (they will finish cooking when returned to the skillet). Season shrimp with salt and ground black pepper and set aside.\nCook and stir onions and celery in the skillet just until tender, about 2 minutes.\nStir cabbage and drained rice noodles into the skillet and continue cooking until cabbage is tender, about 2 minutes. Pour in chicken stock as needed to keep noodles from getting dry.\nStir scrambled eggs, shrimp, salt, and ground black pepper into noodle mixture and gently toss to coat.\nPour sauce over the noodles and toss gently to combine. Continue cooking until shrimp are fully cooked, 2 to 5 minutes.\nRemove from heat and toss cilantro, peanuts, and red chiles into noodles.",
