    "ins": "Break off and discard tough asparagus bottoms. Break off tips; set aside. Coarsely chop stalks.\nCook in skillet over medium heat with onion in butter, salting lightly, for 8 to 10 minutes.\nWhen onions are clear, sprinkle with flour. Continue to stir over lowest possible heat 5 to 8 minutes.\nSlowly add water or stock, stirring constantly. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until thickened. Cool slightly.\nIn blender, puree sauce bit-by-bit with milk until thoroughly smooth.\nReturn puree to 3-quart pan, preferably a double boiler. Add dill, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and tamari. Heat gently but don't boil.\nAs soup heats, cook asparagus tips in boiling water until tender, but still very green, about 2 minutes; drain. Add whole pieces to soup.",
