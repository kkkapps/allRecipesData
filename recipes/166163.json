Toss to combine, then refrigerate until ready to serve.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nBrush the tuna steaks with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs in a shallow bowl until smooth. Dip the tuna steaks in the egg, and allow excess egg to run off. Press into the macadamia nuts.\nCook the tuna steaks on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium. Serve with the papaya salsa.",
