    "des": "\"Swai is light, delicately flavored Asian fish widely available in the US, and very inexpensive. Traditionally this recipe is made with the much more expensive Dover sole, but swai is the perfect substitute for the budget-conscious gourmet.  \nBon appetite, mes amis!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk lemon juice and lemon zest together in a bowl. Mix flour, salt, and pepper together in a resealable gallon-size plastic bag.\nPat swai fish fillets dry with a paper towel; lightly season 1 side of each fillet with salt. Place fillets in the bag with flour mixture, 1 at a time, and shake to coat.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat; add butter and heat until lightly browned. Place coated fish fillets in the browned butter; cook until lightly browned on the edges and fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fish to a plate, reserving butter in the skillet.\nPour lemon juice mixture into skillet with reserved butter; cook and stir until a light sauce forms, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over fish and garnish with parsley.",
