    "des": "\"I made this one night on a whim, not knowing what to do with the ground turkey I had taken out of the freezer. It came out amazing! I served it over baked stuffing and with green bean casserole. My two picky eaters (8 and 5) loved this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Mix ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a large bowl; set aside for 5 minutes.\nStir cranberries, orange juice, and sweetener together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir water and cornstarch together in a bowl; stream into the boiling cranberry mixture while stirring. Bring liquid again to a boil and cook until thickened to your desired consistency, 5 to 10 minutes.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat. Shape the turkey mixture into 6 patties. Fry the patties in the skillet until completely browned on the bottom, about 7 minutes. Flip the patties and continue cooking until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nPour the cranberry-orange gravy over the patties; bring to a simmer and continue cooking until the sauce thickens further, 3 to 4 minutes more.",
