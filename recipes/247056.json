This easy recipe combines egg with mashed banana and a pinch of nutmeg for a yummy and healthy meal. Using spices and herbs in your baby's food is a great way to offer interesting flavours to enhance your baby's experience with new tastes. Speak with your paediatrician if you have any questions about when you can introduce spices to your baby's diet.\"",
