    "ins": "Rinse beans and place in a large pot.  Cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender, about 1 hour; add more water as necessary to prevent drying out and scorching.\nWhen beans are tender, add spaghetti and cook until al dente.  Season with salt to taste.",
