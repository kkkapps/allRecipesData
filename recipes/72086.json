    "ins": "Soak rice noodles in warm water for 20 minutes. Drain, and set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the ketchup, soy sauce, lime juice, sugar, curry powder, peanut butter and chile paste. Set aside.\nHeat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, and cook for about 5 minutes, or until juices run clear. Add the green peppers, and saute for a minute. Move the chicken and pepper to one side of the pan, and pour in the eggs. Cook eggs, stirring constantly until firm and scrambled, stir in the chicken and peppers. Add shrimp and pour in 1/4 of the ketchup mixture along with bean sprouts and noodles. Mix and cook for a few minutes until shrimp are pink. Add the remaining sauce, and cook until heated through. Garnish with green onions and chopped peanuts, and serve.",
