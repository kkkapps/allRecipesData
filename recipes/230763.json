If you like zucchini, you will like this recipe. My brother does not like zucchini and he likes this recipe. Thanks to Joan who created it. Serve it as a side dish or main dish with a salad.\"",
    "ins": "Heat enough olive oil to coat the bottom of a large skillet over medium heat; arrange zucchini slices in the hot oil. Sprinkle zucchini slices with red pepper flakes, garlic salt, and onion salt. Fry until zucchini slices are slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes per side.\nSprinkle each slice with Romano cheese and spoonful of tomato sauce; cook until cheese just begins to melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Top tomato sauce layer with Mexican cheese blend; cover skillet and cook until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.",
