    "des": "\"Crunchy chicken Parmesan that your family will love. Everyone I have made this for has told me it's the best chicken Parmesan ever. Serve over your favorite pasta with your favorite sauce (I use marinara). Sometimes I sprinkle mozzarella cheese over my chicken as well as the Parmesan. I also garnish with chopped fresh basil.\"",
