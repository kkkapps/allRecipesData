    "des": "\"Skinless, boneless chicken breasts are split and stuffed with mushrooms, ricotta, and feta cheeses and marinated artichokes and sprinkled with Italian seasonings and Parmesan! To add Italian flair, serve the chicken over pasta with your favorite sauce. Make sure the mushrooms are sliced thin, and don't rinse the artichoke hearts, just drain them. You can substitute goat cheese for the feta cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Place 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon thyme together in a small bowl or bottle; pour olive oil into bowl. Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate until oil is infused, at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease enough baking dishes to fit all of the stuffed chicken breasts in a single layer.\nStir ricotta cheese, feta cheese, eggs, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, garlic, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, basil, cumin, and 1 tablespoon thyme together in a large bowl.\nPlace chicken breasts on a flat work surface. Use a paring or boning knife to cut from one side of a chicken breast through the middle of the breast to within 1/2-inch of the other side, creating a deep pocket. Spoon mushroom and artichoke mixture into chicken until pocket is full; use toothpick to close and secure the pocket. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts and filling. Place stuffed chicken in prepared baking dishes.\nBrush each chicken breast with about 1 teaspoon infused olive oil and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top.\nBake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool slightly before serving, about 5 minutes.",
