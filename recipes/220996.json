    "des": "\"This pie crust is my personal favorite and is made using a food processor, which makes cutting the butter into the flour very simple. By the way, you can make a double batch of this, and freeze the individually wrapped dough for future pie-related adventures.\"",
    "ins": "Combine flour, salt, and butter in a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 1-second pulses.\nStir water and vinegar in a small bowl.\nPour half the ice water and vinegar mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Pulse to combine, about 3 (1-second) pulses. Pour in remaining ice water and vinegar mixture. Pulse until mixture just starts to come together, about 8 (1-second) pulses.\nTurn dough out onto a wooden surface, pat into round shape and divide in half. Form each half into a disc about 5 inches wide.\nWrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until ready to use.",
