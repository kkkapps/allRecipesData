Most people only fix dressing for Thanksgiving or other holidays, but we love this so much we eat it all year round. Hope you all like it, too!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nPlace the cornbread cubes into a large bowl. Set aside until needed.\nPlace the chicken breasts in a pot and cover with water. Add salt to taste. Bring to a boil, and cook until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove the chicken breasts from the pan, reserving at least 2 cups of the chicken broth. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin and debone, discarding the skin and bones.\nMix the onion, chicken broth, and red pepper with the cornbread; mash the mixture using a hand masher. Season to taste with sage, salt, and black pepper, adding a little at a time. Stir in the chicken. Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes.",
