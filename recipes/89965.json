    "des": "\"Easy, delicious slow cooker recipe that uses some of those dry beans hiding in your pantry.  Just about any bean can be substituted for the black-eyed peas. If you don't want to soak beans overnight, you can use the canned variety.\"",

Season with chili powder, and cumin; stir until well blended.\nCover and cook on high for 2 hours. Stir in rice, and cheese. Continue to cook for a further 30 minutes.",
