    "des": "\"I created this dish after getting tired of all those yam recipes using brown sugar and marshmallows. This makes sweet potatoes taste more like they should - a side dish rather than a dessert. Also, you can easily adapt this recipe to vegan simply by using soy cheese. It's worked well for me in the past.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn the prepared dish, make a single layer of sweet potato slices.  Place a few onion slices on top, dot with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Repeat, alternating layers of white and sweet potatoes.\nIn a small bowl, or measuring cup, combine flour and broth.  Pour over potatoes.\nSprinkle cheese, bread crumbs and parsley over the potatoes.  Dot with remaining butter.  Cover.\nBake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until potatoes and onions are soft.",
