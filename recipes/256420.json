Any flavor you desire is possible by changing the extract and food coloring. This recipe allows you to have as many flavored morsels as there are extracts for a fraction of the cost. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in raspberry extract and red food coloring until evenly blended.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place melted chocolate mixture in a resealable plastic bag and snip off a corner; pipe onto the parchment paper in the shape of \"chips\".\nRefrigerate chips until firm, about 5 minutes. Store in a resealable plastic bag.",
