    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, black pepper, garlic, mustard seed and curing salt until well blended. Divide into 2 or 4 rolls, wrap in aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 24 hours.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the wrapped rolls in the water, and simmer for 1 hour over medium to low heat. Remove carefully, and poke holes in the foil to drain. Set aside to cool. Remove foil, and rewrap with new aluminum foil. Refrigerate until fully chilled, about 3 hours. Slice, and use for sandwiches, crackers, salads or just snacking.",
