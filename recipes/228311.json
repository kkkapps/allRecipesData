    "ins": "Chop the chard stems into 1/2-inch pieces. Stack the chard leaves, roll them tightly into a cylinder, and chop into 1/2-inch strips; chop the strips into halves.\nHeat about half the olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook chopped chard stems in hot oil until hot, about 1 minute. Stir the chard leaves with the stems; cook and stir together 1 minutes more. Drizzle remaining olive oil over the mixture and stir to coat. Continue cooking and stirring until the leaves are nearly wilted, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately sprinkle kosher salt and squeeze lime half over the chard. Stir to season evenly.",
