    "ins": "Slice potatoes into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange potato slices overlapping slightly inside the outer rim of a 9-inch pie or quiche dish.\nSprinkle with green onions, garlic, and white wine vinegar. Cover dish with heavy-duty plastic wrap, and microwave on high about 5 minutes or until just tender.\nRemove from microwave, and let sit covered for 5 minutes.\nCarefully uncover potato slices, allowing steam to escape; drain and reserve liquid. Place potato slices in a bowl, and gently fold in the tuna.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the reserved potato liquid, olive oil, Dijon mustard, salt and pepper. Pour dressing over tuna-potato mixture, mix gently, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.",
