Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 25 minutes.\nArrange broccoli in the bottom of the baking dish. Mix the cream of celery soup, mayonnaise, wine, and curry in a bowl, and pour 1/2 evenly over the broccoli. Cut salmon into chunks and place in baking dish. Top with remaining soup mixture.\nBake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until broccoli is tender and fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve over cooked rice.",
