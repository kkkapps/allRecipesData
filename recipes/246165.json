    "des": "\"This is a slightly more spicy (zingy?) take on the paleo-style cauliflower fried rice with pork. You could use any protein. Adjust the poblano chile to mild it down or heat it up as desired.\"",
    "ins": "Pulse cauliflower in a food processor until it resembles rice.\nHeat sesame oil a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Season pork chops with five-spice powder; cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork chops to a cutting board to rest.\nWhisk soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, red pepper flakes, and ginger together in a bowl.\nReturn wok to medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, carrot, and poblano chile until tender, about 4 minutes. Cut pork chops into cubes.\nPush mushroom mixture to one side of wok. Add eggs; cook and stir until scrambled, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir mushroom mixture and eggs together in wok. Stir in cauliflower and soy sauce mixture; add pork cubes. Cook until cauliflower is tender, 3 to 4 minutes more. Garnish with green onions.",
