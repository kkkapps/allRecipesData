    "des": "\"A delicious southwestern recipe that includes black beans. I use mild salsa, but if you like it spicy, use hot salsa. This is one of my favorite recipes.\"",

Stir until well blended.\nInto a 9x13 inch baking dish, spoon enough of the beef mixture to cover the bottom. Arrange half of the crushed tortilla chips on top of the meat mixture and layer with 1 cup of Cheddar cheese. Spoon another layer of the meat mixture on top of the cheese layer, cover with remaining chips and layer with 1 cup of cheese. Spread final layer of meat mixture on top and sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of cheese on top. Top with diced tomato and green onions.\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
