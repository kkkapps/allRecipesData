    "ins": "Use a food processor or blender to puree the strawberries. Pour the strawberry puree into a large saucepan, and stir in the sugar, sour cream, water and wine. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring gently for 20 to 25 minutes to fully blend the flavors. Do not allow to boil. Serve warm or chilled.",
