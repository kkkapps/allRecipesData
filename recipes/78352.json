Set aside.\nPlace the pieces of bread into a large glass or ceramic bowl, and sprinkle liberally with rubbed sage. Heat bread in the microwave for 2 minutes, then heat for 10 seconds at a time until bread is crispy. Remove from the microwave, and add the egg whites, cranberries, walnuts, almonds and pecans toss lightly to distribute. Add the onion and celery with the butter, and toss lightly while moistening to your desired consistency with chicken broth.\nUse this to stuff a turkey, or transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish.",
