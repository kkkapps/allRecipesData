Place under the broiler and cook until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the green bell peppers, red bell peppers, onion, and chicken. Cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes.\nLayer half of each tortilla with the chicken and vegetable mixture, then sprinkle with the Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and Monterey Jack. Fold the tortillas in half and Place onto a baking sheet.\nBake quesadillas in the preheated oven until the cheeses have melted, about 10 minutes.",
