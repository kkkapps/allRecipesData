    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press pie crusts into two 9-inch pie pans.\nMelt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.\nMix sugar, flour, and salt together in a bowl.\nWhisk buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl; stir buttermilk mixture into sugar mixture. Slowly pour melted chocolate into mixture, while beating with an electric mixer, until filling is smooth. Pour half the filling into each prepared pie crust. Sprinkle pecans over each pie.\nBake pies in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 1 hour. Cool for at least 1 hour before serving.",
