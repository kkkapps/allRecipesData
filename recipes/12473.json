    "des": "\"This crust is especially good as a base for Eggnog Pie with Rum, but can be used with almost any custard pie.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together ground nuts, cinnamon, and sugar.  Mix in melted butter.\nPress the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch, deep-dish style, pie pan.  Chill the unbaked crust in the refrigerator for about 30 to 45 minutes.\nPlace pie crust on a cookie sheet, and position on the middle rack of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.  WATCH it carefully, as nut crusts burn easily; they DON'T have to turn black to taste burnt!   Cool completely before filling.",
