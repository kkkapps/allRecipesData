    "des": "\"If you ever visited Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in the winter months on the Rideau Canal, which is the longest skating rink in the world, they serve 'Beaver Tails,' a sweet pastry that is essentially a flat doughnut with sugar on top. I could not get the authentic recipe since it is their trade secret, but I created a replica of what they serve.\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.  Set aside until creamy.\nIn a large bowl, mix together oil, 2-1/3 cups water, salt, and 4 tablespoons sugar.  Add yeast, and gradually mix in flour.  Place dough in a buttered bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover with a damp tea towel, and place in a warm place to rise for 1-1/2 hours.\nForm dough into balls about the size of eggs, then roll flat to make ovals about 1/4 inch thick.\nHeat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep fryer, pot, or electric frying pan.  Fry doughnuts one at a time, until light brown on both sides.  Place on paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle with white sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice while still hot.",
