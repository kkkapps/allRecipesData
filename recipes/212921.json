    "des": "\"This relish is made normally with very fresh green papayas. Sauerkraut can also be used.\"",
    "ins": "Toss the grated papaya with 1/4 cup salt together in a large bowl; allow to sit for 1 hour. Drain the liquid from the papaya and rinse thoroughly. Place the papaya in the middle of a large piece of cheesecloth and squeeze to drain as much liquid from the papaya as possible.\nCombine the papaya, carrot, red bell pepper, ginger, green chile peppers, and raisins together in a clean large bowl; mix. Transfer the mixture to clean, dry jars with lids.\nStir the vinegar, water, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil for 5 minutes. Pour the vinegar mixture into the jars, making sure the vegetables are completely submerged in liquid. Allow the vegetables to marinate in the liquid at least 1 day before using. Store in refrigerator between uses.",
