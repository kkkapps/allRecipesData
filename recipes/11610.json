    "des": "\"These scrumptious little cuties taste great decorated with icing or just left plain.  For a darker, spicier cookie, use molasses instead of corn syrup.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, Stir together the margarine, brown sugar, and molasses over medium heat until dissolved. Pour into a large mixing bowl, and let cool for 5 minutes. Stir the egg and vanilla into the melted mixture until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves; stir into the wet mixture. Cover and chill dough for a few hours or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C ).\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into bear shapes with a cookie cutter, and place onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, cookies should be firm.",
