    "des": "\"Moist pink cake is sandwiched between smooth layers of real cream and a thin layer of rich frosting seals the deal. Little splashes of champagne help give this cake a delicate evanescence that is sure to be a show stopper. This is a great cake to serve for birthdays, showers, or for any very special occasion. Guests will rave for the recipe. Keep cake refrigerated.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans.\nBlend cake mix, 1 1/3 cup pink Champagne, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until moistened, about 1 minute. Add 3 tablespoons cherry juice and red food coloring; beat at medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Divide batter between cake pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 29 to 34 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Invert onto wire racks and let cool completely, 25 to 30 minutes.\nBeat heavy cream with an electric mixer until peaks form. Sprinkle white chocolate pudding mix over cream; beat until thoroughly mixed.
