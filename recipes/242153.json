    "des": "\"If hot sauce is your thing, you will love, love, love this fresh tasty recipe. I first tried a version of this hot sauce in Cameroon, Africa. I couldn't get enough of it; no matter where you ate, there would be a small bowl of this divine sauce on the table, each unique to the person making it. Only recently have I actively searched out the recipe. I did not follow the recipe to a tee, but combined this recipe with another a close friend gave me. In the end, I can't argue the results!\"",
