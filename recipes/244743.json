    "des": "\"I made this sauce off the top of my head totally winging it ( its funny because its for wings ) where I work. It actually turned out to be a \ngreat sauce with awesome flavor and coats the wings perfectly. Everyone loved it so I had to share it and even made pizza with it using it instead of pizza sauce and it was great. It's great on other things too, so experiment and let me know what you come up with.\"",
