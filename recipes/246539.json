    "des": "\"I was trying to get a little creative in the kitchen the other night and stumbled across this combination that ended up tasting really great! Although my 2 year-old is still on the fence (as she is with most green veggies), my husband and I loved them. A very easy and inexpensive way to dress up your sugar snaps! Serve immediately or at room temperature.\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nToss sugar snap peas with olive oil in a bowl and in a single layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle more olive oil on top; season with salt and pepper. Combine cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle onto sugar snap peas.\nCook in the preheated oven until sugar snap peas are lightly browned and sugar has caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes.",
