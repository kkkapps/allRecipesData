    "des": "\"A wonderful savory meatball and sweet sauce recipe that works as a main dish, or you can use just the meatball recipe part for parties. I recommend serving over white rice.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large, shallow baking sheet.\nIn a large bowl, thoroughly mix the ground beef, eggs, bread crumbs and onion. Sprinkle with ginger, seasoning salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and sugar. Shape into one inch balls.\nPlace meatballs in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes; set aside.\nTo make the sauce, mix enough water with the reserved pineapple juice to make 1 cup. In a large pot over medium heat, combine the juice mixture, 1/3 cup water, vinegar, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Stir in cornstarch, ginger and seasoning salt, until smooth. Cover and cook until thickened.\nStir pineapple chunks, carrot, green pepper and meatballs into the sauce. Gently stir to coat the meatballs with the sauce. Simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until meatballs are thoroughly cooked.",
