    "des": "\"This is a quick and easy chocolate-fix that the kids and adults will love. It's easy to play around with the ingredients to suit. My family has been making it for years and it's still a fave! Ingredients can be switched up with great results. It's also great with white chocolate and cranberries or crushed peppermints. You can use any nuts in place of the almonds.\"",
    "ins": "Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.\nStir oats, chocolate chips, coconut, and almonds together in a large bowl.\nWhisk sugar, milk, butter, and salt together in a saucepan; bring mixture to a boil, add vanilla, and remove from heat. Pour milk mixture over chocolate chips mixture; stir until well-combined. Drop spoonfuls of chocolate mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator until haystacks are set, 15 to 20 minutes.",
