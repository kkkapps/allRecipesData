    "ins": "Stir whiskey, molasses, and brown sugar in a saucepan until brown sugar has dissolved. Place over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and turn off heat; stir salt and hot pepper sauce into mixture. Pour marinade into a large bowl.\nPlace turkey breast into the marinade with skin side down; let stand for 1 hour, turning turkey breast over occasionally. Transfer turkey to a roasting pan. Retain marinade for basting.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nRoast turkey breast in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Baste turkey occasionally with retained marinade. Allow turkey breast to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.",
