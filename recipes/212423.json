Spread onto a baking sheet to cool.\nHeat 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil in the skillet, again over medium-low heat. Fry the red chile peppers in the hot oil until they begin to change color, about 5 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet.\nUse a mortar and pestle to grind the sesame seeds, chile peppers, and salt into a powder. Nuvvu podi will keep for a few months on the shelf.",
