    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans.\nStir the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a large bowl. Whisk together the pumpkin, water, eggs, vanilla, and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl. Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry while whisking until everything is well mixed. Fold the walnuts into the batter. Divide the batter between the two prepared loaf pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is golden and springs back when lightly pressed, 50 to 60 minutes. Allow to cool 20 minutes before removing from the pans.",
