    "ins": "In a medium mixer bowl combine the crushed peanuts, paprika, ginger, turmeric, honey, olive oil and salt; use an electric mixer to blend together and form a thick, crunchy, spreadable paste. (Note: If you find it too gooey or thick, try adding a little cola; it gives the recipe a nice, exotic flavor!)\nPlace chicken thighs in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Using your hands, cover chicken pieces with the peanut mixture, coating them completely. Cover dish and refrigerate to marinate overnight.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace chicken pieces in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish; cover with aluminum foil and bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 45 to 60 minutes or until juices run clear, turning every 15 minutes so that they cook evenly.",
