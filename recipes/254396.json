    "des": "\"For homemade hummus that is creamy, flavorful and quick to make, start with a can of GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Low Sodium Chick Peas! Our premium, nutty-tasting chickpeas cook up perfectly tender in the can and are lower in sodium than the original. Simply blend the chickpeas with olive oil, lemon juice and a handful of other pantry ingredients, then spread on a party platter and top with a quick olive salsa for a crowd-pleasing dip with the silkiest texture and true Mediterranean pizzazz.\"",
    "ins": "In food processor or blender, combine chick peas, olive oil, lemon juice, tahini, garlic, 1 tablespoon water, cumin, paprika and Adobo. Puree until mixture is smooth and creamy, about one minute.\nIn medium bowl, combine olives, capers, tomatoes, shallots, parsley and hot sauce. This should make approximately two cups of salsa.\nMound salsa in center of large serving dish. Spoon hummus in ring around salsa. (As an alternate presentation, layer hummus, and then salsa, alternating layers, in a shallow dish.) Drizzle with olive oil, if desired. Serve with crackers.",
