    "ins": "Heat the milk until it is just slightly warm to the touch. Stir in the yeast and sugar. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the yolks and sour cream until well blended. Add the flour and salt; knead vigorously, on a well floured surface, for 15 minutes. . Cover dough and let it rise for 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Divide dough into 5 pieces. Shape the pieces into balls, then roll them out to 1/8 inch thickness. Stir together the nuts, 1/2 cup of sugar and melted butter to make the filling. Spread about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of filling onto the dough. Roll up like a jellyroll and pinch to seal.\nPlace rolls onto baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Brush with egg white, and bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven.  Cool, slice, and serve.",
