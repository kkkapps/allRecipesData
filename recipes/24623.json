Allow potato mixture to cool approximately 10 minutes, or until it may be safely handled.\nPlace flour, egg white and dry bread crumbs in three separate small bowls. Roll potato mixture into 1 inch logs or balls. Cover in flour, dip in egg white and coat with bread crumbs.\nCarefully lower small batches of the coated potatoes into the deep fryer. Fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes.",
