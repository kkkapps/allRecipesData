    "des": "\"This was the hit of my daughter's bridal shower brunch. I served 2 kinds of punch but had to make another batch of this one half way through the shower! One guest took the recipe and introduced it to her church where it became a staple at all gatherings. I like a stronger coffee flavor and sometimes use espresso granules.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan; remove from heat and stir in chocolate drink mix, sugar, and coffee granules. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hour or overnight.\nPour chocolate mixture in a large punch bowl about 30 minutes before serving. Scoop vanilla and chocolate ice cream into the bowl, stirring until partially melted. Garnish with dollops of whipped topping and shaved milk chocolate.",
