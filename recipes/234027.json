    "des": "\"As a precocious Norwegian-Canadian kid, I learned to eat these first and then calmly state, 'Those were excellent, but they looked like vomit!' - and would instantly get banned from the table. It was okay, I was full and had eaten the best part of the meal! \nI'm an adult now, and they're still delicious (but vomitous looking - almost like a thick creamed pea soup, but they taste better). Give them a chance; you will never eat canned peas again!\"",
    "ins": "Place peas with cold water in a pot; leave to soak for 24 to 48 hours.\nBring peas to a boil in the soaking water. Reduce heat to low and simmer until peas are very soft, stirring occasionally, about 1 1/2 hours, adding water if needed.\nStir butter, salt, sugar, and parsley into peas. For thicker peas, add flour and cook and stir until thick, about 5 minutes.",
