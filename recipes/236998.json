    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the campanelle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Transfer pasta to a large bowl, add ricotta cheese, and stir so the ricotta begins to melt into the pasta.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in olive oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Sir tomato sauce, basil, and oregano with the onion; bring to a simmer and cook another 2 to 3 minutes.\nPour tomato sauce over the pasta and stir until the sauce and cheese evenly coat the pasta.",
