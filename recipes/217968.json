    "des": "\"Guaranteed to be an instant comfort food favorite. Inspired by a Rachel Ray recipe, I have modified it by adding a creamy and cheesy kick to it.  You'll be dreaming about this dish. Feel free to play with the recipe. I put in the cream cheese and Cheddar to make it creamier.  I am a huge fan of Buffalo Chicken Dip and wanted this dish to be similar.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground chicken. Cook and stir until the chicken is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Stir in the onion, garlic, salt and black pepper; cook until the onion has softened, about 7 to 8 minutes.\nCombine chicken stock, Buffalo wing sauce, red wine vinegar, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Pour into the skillet with the chicken and add the Neufchatel and Cheddar cheese; simmer and stir until the cheeses have melted and everything is well combined. Serve on buns, and top with crumbled blue cheese.",
