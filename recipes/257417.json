    "des": "\"I work at an ice cream parlor, and I can honestly say this ice cream will give any store-bought ice cream a run for its money! From start to finish this recipe takes about a day to make, however most of that time is for the ice cream base to chill before freezing in your ice cream maker as well as freezing it before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Combine heavy cream, sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until steaming, 3 to 4 minutes.\nWhisk egg yolks in a bowl. Whisk in 1 cup of the hot cream. Pour egg and cream mixture back into the saucepan; cook and stir until mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes. Mix in banana and vanilla extract.\nTransfer mixture to the refrigerator; chill until very cold, at least 2 hours.\nFreeze cold mixture in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a freezer-safe container; fold in maraschino cherries, strawberry jam, and chocolate syrup.\nFreeze ice cream until firm, about 4 hours.",
