    "des": "\"This is a simple dish using fresh bratwurst, onions, and balsamic vinegar. It has a nice tangy flavor, and is excellent served in crusty bread and topped with spicy mustard. My other favorite way is to serve with a side of greens and potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet, combine onion, balsamic vinegar, and water.  Simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Place bratwurst in the simmering water; cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Be sure the water is only simmering, not boiling.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nRemove the bratwurst, and drain liquid from pan. Add butter to the pan with the onions, and cook over low heat until onions are browned.\nGrill brats over high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, turning to brown on all sides. Serve with onions.",
