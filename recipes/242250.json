    "des": "\"I've been working hard on the best burgers for a long time. I've found this relatively simple recipe to be delicious and rich in flavor, with the lard being the secret ingredient. You could substitute another fat, but for best results lard is the answer! Get creative with toppings!\"",
    "ins": "Mix ground beef and ground pork together in a bowl using 2 spoons.\nHeat lard in a a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallots and garlic until fragrant and tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shallot mixture to meat mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Form mixture into patties, taking care to handle mixture as little as possible.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nGrill hamburgers on the preheated grill until desired doneness is reached, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
