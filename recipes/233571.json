    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.\nBring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the chicken breasts in boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a cutting board to cool.\nBeat cream cheese, garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Stir tomatoes, green onion, green chiles, cilantro, and lime juice into the cream cheese mixture. Add 1 cup Cheddar cheese and fold to integrate.\nShred cooled chicken with a pair of forks into strands; stir into the cream cheese mixture. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture into the center of each tortilla and fold tortilla around the filling; arrange into the prepared baking dish. Top tortillas with remaining Cheddar cheese and green enchilada sauce.\nBake in the preheated oven until hot and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.",
