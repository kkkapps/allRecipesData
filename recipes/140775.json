    "des": "\"We had an Aussie Mix with terrible skin allergies. They were so bad that we had to put her on shots. Finally, a groomer in Austin, Texas suggested eliminating corn from my dog's diet. Since we have had difficulty finding corn-free treats,  I developed this recipe. Both our dogs love them!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.\nCombine oats, flax seeds, brewer's yeast, cheese, rice flour, oat bran flour and sugar in a large bowl.  Whisk together chicken broth and eggs; mix with oat mixture to make a fairly stiff dough.\nRoll dough into 1 inch balls, then flatten into discs. (Or, roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/4 or 3/8 inch thick and cut into 1-inch x 1 1/2-inch rectangles.)  Place on cookie sheets 3/4 inch apart.\nBake until dry and the edges turn a light golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.  Cool before serving.",
