    "ins": "Mix garlic, olive oil, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Toss in mushrooms, and allow to marinate for 20 minutes.\nThread one piece each, bread, mushroom, and havarti onto cocktail toothpicks or small skewers. Arrange on a platter, drizzle with remaining marinade, and serve.",
