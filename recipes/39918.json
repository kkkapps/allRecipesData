    "des": "\"These extra chocolaty cookies will cast a chocolate spell on you. Once you have eaten them, you will want nothing else. Serve with ice cream and coffee. If you can't find Dutch process cocoa at your store, just add a pinch of baking soda to the dry ingredients. They are great with frosting too!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, stir together the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, flour and salt until well blended. Cut in the butter until lumps are no larger than peas. Add eggs and vanilla; mix until a stiff dough forms. It may take a minute to come together.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. If the dough is too sticky, chill for a little bit. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the surface appears dry. Allow cookies to cool for a couple minutes on the baking sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely. When cookies are completely cool, melt the chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave. Stir frequently until smooth. Dip cookies or drizzle with the chocolate and place on waxed paper to set.",
