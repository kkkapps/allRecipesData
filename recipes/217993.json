    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the summer squash and onion until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir occasionally.\nWhile the squash are cooking, mix together the eggs, milk, 1 cup of Cheddar cheese, sugar, flour, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Stir in the squash mixture and melted butter; turn into a 2-quart casserole dish. Top with the remaining 2 cups of Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the casserole is set and the cheese topping is crisp and starting to brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Allow to stand for 15 minutes before serving.",
