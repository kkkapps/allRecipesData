    "des": "\"We came up with this recipe after trying Trader Joe's\u00c2\u00ae honey walnut cream cheese; this was much better since we used the orange blossom honey my mom buys from local farmers' market. She suggest toasting the walnuts. To make a sweeter version, add a tablespoon of granulated sugar while pulsing in the processor. Spread a layer on a slice of your favorite bread and enjoy! Yum!\"",
