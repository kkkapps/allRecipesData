    "ins": "In a large bowl mix together the warm water (110 degrees), yeast, sugar, salt, and olive oil. Stir in 2 cups of the flour in order to make a soft ball.

Cover and let rise until doubled in size.\nPunch down dough, and form into ball or loaf shape. Place onto a greased cookie sheet. Cover and let rise for 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.",
