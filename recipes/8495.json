Coat a 7x11 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.\nPound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.\nSprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.  Place 1 cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll up each breast, and secure with a toothpick.  Place in baking dish, and sprinkle chicken evenly with bread crumbs.\nBake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from oven, and place 1/2 cheese slice on top of each breast.  Return to oven for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese has melted. Remove toothpicks, and serve immediately.",
