    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nBeat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add sugar and salt; beat until combined. Beat in egg and vanilla extract until well-blended. Blend in melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and espresso. Mix in flour gradually, until batter is smooth. Fold in chocolate chips, chopped hazelnuts, and ground hazelnuts.\nDrop heaping tablespoons of cookie batter 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Use the back of a wet fork to flatten each cookie slightly, making a crisscross pattern.\nBake in the preheated oven until set and edges start to darken, about 15 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before serving.",
