    "des": "\"These burgers combine beef and sausage with all the fixin's right inside! They're made for grilling outside, but could easily be done on an indoor grill, too.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nMix the ground beef, sausage, onion, chile pepper, garlic, Muenster cheese, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and chili powder in a mixing bowl until evenly combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper and mix again. Form the meat mixture into 8 patties.\nCook on the preheated grill until the burgers are no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
