    "des": "\"For this tasty pierogi casserole, sauerkraut, onion, mushrooms, and pasta are combined and baked in a rich, buttery sauce. If you are making this ahead and are going to reheat it in the oven you may have to add a little water. If cold, bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\"",
    "ins": "Place the sauerkraut and onion in a large skillet over medium-low heat with enough water to cover. Simmer 1 hour, or until most of the water has cooked off.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nIn a medium skillet over medium heat, saute the mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of the butter for about 5 minutes.\nStir the remaining butter, cooked pasta, and cream of mushroom soup into the sauerkraut mixture. Cook and stir 15 minutes, or until heated through.",
