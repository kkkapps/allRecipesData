    "des": "\"This is a yummy, very easy cranberry upside-down cake with lots of cranberries and pecans! Serve warm with whipped cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 2 quart rectangular baking dish.\nSpread the cranberries evenly over the bottom of the baking dish, and sprinkle the pecans over the cranberries. Spoon 1 cup of sugar over the cranberries and pecans.\nPlace the eggs into the work bowl of an electric mixer, and beat on high speed about 1 minute, until the eggs are foamy. Beat in 1 cup of sugar, the flour, melted butter, and milk, and beat on Low until just mixed. The batter will be thick. Spread the batter evenly over the cranberry-pecan mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cake is lightly brown and a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Carefully invert the cake onto a serving plate, so the cranberry-pecan layer is on top. Let cool 30 minutes before serving.",
