It is full of delicious super foods and super flavors! Each ingredient should be considered to taste. Some prefer more dressing while others prefer more seeds. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk liquid amino acid, lemon juice, and olive oil together in a bowl until smooth; add red onion and alfalfa sprouts and stir to coat. Marinate onion and sprouts in the dressing for at least 15 minutes.\nPut kale into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle sunflower kernels, pepitas, and sesame seeds over the kale. Pour the onion and sprout mixture with the dressing over the kale and seeds; mix together by hand to coat kale, massaging dressing into the leaves to soften.\nCover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate salad at least 1 hour.",
