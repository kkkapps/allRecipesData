    "des": "\"A fast and easy gluten-free salad that will please everybody. I made up this recipe using whatever I had on hand and it turned out great. The texture and flavors of the ingredients complement each other from the al dente earthy buckwheat to the crisp avocado, onion, soft tomatoes, and cheese. This summery salad can be served as a side dish or appetizer anytime.\"",
    "ins": "Combine water and buckwheat in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan, and simmer until the buckwheat is firm yet tender to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse buckwheat under cold water and drain.\nStir avocado, cherry tomatoes, lime juice, red onion, olive oil, parsley, fennel seed, cayenne pepper, and mixed pepper together in a large bowl until evenly combined. Add buckwheat groats and stir gently; top with goat cheese.",
