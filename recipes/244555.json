    "des": "\"Crushed chocolate cookies and ice cream make great 'dirt' for this spooky treat! This recipe was adapted from Strange-1's original pudding cake.\"",
    "ins": "Crush the cookies in 2 batches in a food processor. You'll need about 4 1/3 cups crumbs.\nSpread 1 1/3 cups crumbs over bottom of a 9-x-13-inch baking pan.\nCut away cardboard packaging from 1 carton of ice cream with scissors. Slice ice cream crosswise into 1-inch-thick rounds with a long knife. Arrange slices over crumbs, cutting smaller pieces to fill gaps. Cover ice cream with another 1 1/3 cups crumbs. Repeat with second container of ice cream, and top with remaining crumbs. Freeze until firm, at least 1 hour.\nMix frosting with enough green food coloring to make it bright green, then transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip. Arrange 3 double rows of pumpkins on top of cake and pipe vines connecting pumpkins. Freeze until ready to serve.",
