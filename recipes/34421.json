    "ins": "Place the bulgur wheat into a saucepan with at least 3 times it's depth in water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Add water if necessary to prevent burning. When the wheat is tender, stir in a pinch of salt and simmer for 5 more minutes. When done, drain and set aside to cool.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Place the diced avocado into a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then toss with lemon juice to thoroughly coat.\nIn a large bowl, combine the tuna and cooled bulgur wheat. Add the bacon and the avocado with its juice, and toss gently. Serve as a meal or as a salad.",
