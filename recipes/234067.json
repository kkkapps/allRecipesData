    "des": "\"This is my interpretation of a virgin sunset. I also refer to this as a pineapple, orange, cherry cocktail. The grenadine will sink to bottom causing layering of orange and red, hence, 'sunset.' If you wanted to make this alcoholic, a shot of champagne is my favorite, but tequila and vodka are other good alternatives. Flavored schnapps may also be an interesting mix.\"",
