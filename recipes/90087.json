    "des": "\"This is my twist on a recipe I found for the traditional chicken salad but without the mayo! It's best served in a wrap with lettuce and tomato or over your favorite green salad. I have found it's also very easy to make even lighter by using fat-free broth, lite soy sauce, and sugar substitute - none of which affects the taste!\"",
    "ins": "Place the lime peel, soy sauce, and chicken broth in  a skillet over medium heat. Place the chicken breasts in the skillet, and bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. Shred chicken, and set aside.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, anchovy paste, sugar, salt, and pepper.  Stir in garlic, cilantro, shallots, and chicken. Mix well.",
