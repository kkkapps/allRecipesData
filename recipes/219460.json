    "des": "\"Rabbit and garlic-a very different take on your classic grilling option. Always a great conversation starter, these bunnies will make your mouth water! We use rabbits that were hunted in the great Southwest desert during rabbit season. However, a lot of local stores sell rabbit as well. The 'wild hares' here are smaller and leaner than their supermarket counterparts, so I use two smaller rabbits and adjust the cook time during rabbit season or one large rabbit in the off time.\"",
    "ins": "Wash and pat dry the rabbit pieces; place into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour in marinade and seal the bag. Turn the bag over several times to coat rabbit with marinade and allow to marinate in refrigerator 2 to 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Reduce to low. Remove rabbit from marinade and shake off excess liquid; discard the used marinade.\nLay the rabbit pieces onto lower rack of grill. Grill until the rabbit shows good grill marks, the meat is no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
