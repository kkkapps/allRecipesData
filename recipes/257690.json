    "des": "\"This homemade pineapple ice cream is reminiscent of the infamous 'Dole Whip' at Disney\u00c2\u00ae. This version packs great pineapple flavor but it more smooth and creamy. Make this a float by dishing the ice cream into a glass and pour pineapple juice over it and top with whipped cream. This is a refreshing summer treat!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk cream, pineapple juice, and sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; stir in lemon juice. Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours.\nTransfer pineapple mixture to an ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's instructions.",
