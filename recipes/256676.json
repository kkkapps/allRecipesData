    "des": "\"This is my favorite way to use tempeh. The honey in the marinade allows the tempeh to caramelize beautifully. You can also add diced red pepper for a little extra color. Serve with pita bread and lentil soup to round out the meal. Serve with additional mint as a garnish.\"",
    "ins": "Mix 1/3 cup water, soy sauce, honey, 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, garlic, lemon juice, and liquid smoke together in a bowl until marinade is smooth; add tempeh and turn to coat evenly. Marinate tempeh, turning frequently, for 20 minutes.\nCombine vegetable broth, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 1/2 tablespoons curry powder, and salt in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid; bring to a boil. Add couscous, cover saucepan, and remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; add tempeh and marinade. Cook tempeh until browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Turn and brown the other side, about 5 minutes more. Remove tempeh from skillet.\nPour remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil into the same skillet; cook and stir onion until fragrant and brown, about 4 minutes. Add chickpeas and water; cook and stir using a wooden spoon to break up brown bits of food on the skillet, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low.\nFold couscous into the onion mixture; add tempeh. Sprinkle mint over couscous; cook and stir until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes.",
