    "des": "\"This is a simple and inexpensive version of an old-country style dish just like grandma used to bake. It really takes you back a few decades. I combine macaroni, sharp Cheddar cheese, and petite diced tomatoes with other herbs and spices for a delicious old-fashioned favorite.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare an 8 quart baking dish with cooking spray.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Pour into the prepared baking dish and add the butter, Cheddar cheese, and diced tomatoes; stir.\nCombine the eggs, milk, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, brown mustard, hot sauce, parsley, nutmeg, pepper, and salt in a food processor; pulse until smooth; pour over the macaroni. Sprinkle paprika over everything.\nBake in the preheated oven until the middle is set, 45 to 50 minutes.",
