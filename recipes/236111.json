    "des": "\"This cheese dip is easily the best that I've ever had, and being a college student I've had quite a lot. The only reason there are ever leftovers is because this dip is so delicious and filling. I recommend Mission\u00c2\u00ae or On The Border\u00c2\u00ae chips because this dip is rather thick and you need a durable chip that wont break off too easy!\"",

Transfer meat mixture to a large pot and add Cheddar cheese, tomatoes with green chile peppers, cream cheese, picante sauce, garlic powder, and cumin.\nHeat cheese mixture over medium-high heat. Gradually stir in processed cheese until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.",
