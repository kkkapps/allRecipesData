    "des": "\"Fluffy pancakes that melt in your mouth. Separating the eggs and folding the whipped whites into the batter, nothing is better. Grills up to a golden brown.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine flour and baking powder. Stir in milk and egg yolk until smooth.\nIn a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.",
