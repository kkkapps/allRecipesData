    "des": "\"Slices of sweet potato baked with cinnamon and brown sugar.  The caramelized brown sugar make these potatoes taste like candy! I attended a catered dinner and the caterer served these with a beautiful turkey dinner. I begged for the recipe, been making it ever since.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Pour the oil into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and place in the oven until hot, about 5 minutes.\nAdd potatoes to the oiled dish, and bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, turning after 10 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and pepper.\nAfter the 20 minutes is up, remove the potatoes from the oven, and sprinkle with the brown sugar mixture. Stir to coat. Return to the oven, and roast for another 10 minutes, or until potatoes are tender and golden brown. Stir potatoes as necessary to allow them to brown evenly.\nRemove potatoes to paper towels to drain, then transfer to a serving dish, and sprinkle with lime juice.",
