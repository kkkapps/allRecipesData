    "ins": "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Cook and stir ground beef until browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion, baharat, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in parsley. Drain juices and let cool, 10 to 15 minutes.\nLay 1 egg roll wrapper at a 45-degree angle on a flat work surface; place 3 tablespoons of the beef mixture in the center. Fold bottom corner over beef mixture and roll up halfway. Fold in both sides. Moisten edges of the top corner and roll up, pressing down top corner to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers and beef mixture.\nHeat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook rolls in batches until light brown, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.",
