    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Butter a shallow, 1-quart baking dish.\nIn a medium bowl, combine melted butter and brioche.  Line the bottom of the baking dish with one-third of the mixture.\nIn another bowl, combine rhubarb, apple, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice and zest.  Let rest until juices begin to run, 5 minutes.  Then spread half of the mixture over the brioche in the dish.  Top with half the remaining brioche.  Spread the remaining rhubarb over that and top with the last of the brioche.  Dot with 1 tablespoon butter.  Spoon the warm water evenly over the top.\nCover and bake in preheated oven 25 to 35 minutes, until rhubarb is tender.  Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), uncover dish, and bake until top is crusty, rhubarb is soft, and bubbles form at the edges of the dish, 10 to 15 minutes.  Serve warm.",
