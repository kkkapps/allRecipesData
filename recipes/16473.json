    "des": "\"What makes this meatloaf so good is how you cook it! It's very important to cook this in a baking dish rather than a loaf pan. The grease will drain from the meatloaf this way, and it will be firmer and taste better.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, combine the beef, onion, crushed crackers, salt, ground black pepper, steak sauce, eggs and water and mix well. Transfer to an ungreased 9x13 inch baking dish. Form into a loaf about 6x10 inches.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until center is completely cooked.",
