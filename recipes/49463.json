    "des": "\"One of the most fabulous one dish meals ever! Eggplant baked casserole style layered with seasoned vegetables and Swiss cheese. Bread, a green salad, wine and it is a feast for any group.\"",
    "ins": "Slice eggplant lengthwise into 1/2 inch slices. Place slices into a colander and sprinkle with salt. Set the colander in the sink to drain off liquid.\nCook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease. Add onion and green pepper to the skillet, and cook until tender. Stir in the tomatoes, and season with salt, pepper, thyme, marjoram, garlic powder and sage. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer for about 10 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Squeeze excess moisture from the eggplant. Fry the eggplant slices in the hot oil until browned on both sides. Arrange half of the eggplant slices in the bottom of a 1 1/2 quart baking dish. Top with half of the bacon and tomato mixture. Sprinkle with half of the Swiss cheese. Repeat layers ending with cheese on top.\nBake, uncovered, for 35 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.",
