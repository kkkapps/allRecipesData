    "des": "\"Cold-brewed coffee poured over coffee ice cubes makes the best iced coffee. It takes a bit of planning, but its full, rich flavor makes the wait worthwhile. The ideal coffee for this cold drink is a blend of mid-roasted beans with moderate acid. Using a dark roast and beans high in acid produces a sharper, more bitter result.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a tall glass with coffee ice cubes. Pour in the cold brewed coffee. Sweeten to taste with Sweet'N Low. Add milk as desired.\nTo Make Cold-Brewed Coffee: Place the coffee in a glass jar, add the water, and stir to combine. Cover and set aside at room temperature for 12 hours or overnight.\nStrain the coffee through a large-size paper coffee filter, a fine sieve, or a strainer lined with cheesecloth. Cold-brewed coffee can be refrigerated in a covered jar for up to 24 hours. This recipe can be doubled.",
