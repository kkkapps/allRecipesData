    "des": "\"This is a 'brown sauce' that I have had over chimichangas in Mexican restaurants, and is one of my favorites.  When I found I could make it at home, it has become a regular.  May be served as soup or over chimis. Top with sour cream and shredded cheese.  Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Pour half of the Worcestershire sauce into the pan of a slow cooker, and half of the garlic pepper. Place the roast in the pan, and sprinkle remaining Worcestershire sauce and garlic pepper over the top. Add the onions, and chilies, and pour in the chicken broth. Cover, and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours.\nWhen the roast is tender enough to pull apart with a fork, add the green salsa, and the beans, if desired. Continue cooking until heated through. Serve as soup or over chimichangas.",
