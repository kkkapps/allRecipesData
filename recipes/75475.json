Once the water is boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the cubed pork, rice and broccoli. Stir in the cream of celery soup and mayonnaise, then season with pepper and curry powder. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with aluminum foil.\nBake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until evenly heated through.
