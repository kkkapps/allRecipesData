    "des": "\"This is one of my nephew's favorite grilled recipes. Jerk means Jamaican barbecue. This well rounded flavor of sweet, hot, herbal and spicy chicken can be served with rice, beans or pasta. Or just make a chicken sandwich out of it! I also add garlic and a kiwi to the marinade.\"",
    "ins": "In a food processor or blender, combine the green onions, onion, jalapeno pepper, soy sauce, vinegar, vegetable oil, brown sugar, thyme, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Mix for about 15 seconds.\nPlace the chicken in a medium bowl, and coat with the marinade. Refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat grill for high heat.\nLightly oil grill grate. Cook chicken on the prepared grill 6 to 8 minutes, until juices run clear.",
