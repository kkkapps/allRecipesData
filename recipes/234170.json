My son hates mushrooms and hates bacon but he eats these all up every time. These can also be cooked in the oven over a grill rack in a cake pan.\"",
    "ins": "Soak wooden skewers in a bowl of water for about 10 minutes.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nWrap 1 slice bacon around each mushroom and thread onto skewers, leaving about 1/2 inch of space between each wrapped mushroom.\nCook on the preheated grill, rotating the skewers often, until bacon is crispy, 10 to 15 minutes.",
