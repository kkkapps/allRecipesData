    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Wear gloves to prevent hot pepper oil from contacting skin. Cut the pepper in half from top to bottom; remove the stem, seeds, and ribs, then place the pepper cut-side-down onto the prepared baking sheet.  Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the pepper has blackened and blistered, about 5 minutes. Place the blackened pepper into a bowl, and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the pepper to steam as it cools, about 10 minutes. Once cool, remove the skin and discard; chop the pepper.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the corn bread mix, egg, and milk; stir just to combine. Lightly mix in the pineapple and jalapeno. Scoop batter into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.",
