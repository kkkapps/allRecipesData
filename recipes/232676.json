    "ins": "Put red beans in a large pot with enough water to cover by several inches. Soak 8 hours to overnight.\nDrain and rinse beans. Pour hot water into the pot. Add beans, sausage, onions, bell pepper, celery, cayenne pepper, salt, and bay leaf to the pot; stir. Place pot over medium heat, put a cover on the pot, and cook, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking at a simmer until the beans are tender, about 30 minutes more. Remove and discard bay leaf before serving.",
