Seal bag and shake to evenly coat chicken.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRemove chicken from bag and shake off any excess coating; fry in the preheated oil until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.\nCombine hot sauce and butter in saucepan over medium heat; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Coat cooked chicken wings with sauce.",
