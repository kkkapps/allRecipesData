Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions to the pan. Cook and stir until transparent.\nIn a small bowl or cup, stir together the flour and water. Mix in the evaporated milk. Pour into the pan with the onions; cook, stirring constantly, until gravy has thickened. Stir in the bouillon cube, garlic salt, chives, salt and pepper. Return the bacon to the skillet, and add the shrimp. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until shrimp are pink and opaque. Serve over grits, biscuits or rice.",
