    "des": "\"Serve this lemony goat cheese salad as a side dish or as a meal with crunchy walnuts and tender butterhead lettuce. Each tangy-fresh salad offers fewer than 200 calories. Wrapping aluminum foil around each beet for roasting creates a small steam chamber to cook each vegetable. In addition to locking in nutrients and flavor, the aluminum foil-wrapped beets cook without getting dry.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare Lemon Vinaigrette; cover and set aside.\nLemon Vinaigrette: In a medium bowl whisk together lemon juice, shallot, mustard, lemon zest, and honey. In a steady stream, slowly whisk in 1/3 cup olive oil. Makes 2/3 cup.\nScrub beets. Wrap each beet in Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake 1-1/2 hours or until a knife can be easily inserted into beets. Cool 20 minutes or until able to handle. Remove and discard foil. Trim off stem and root ends of roasted beets. Peel and cut into 1-inch pieces.\nIn a medium bowl combine beets, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette.\nIn another medium bowl combine fennel, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette.\nLine 8 salad plates with lettuce. Drizzle with remaining vinaigrette. Layer with beets, walnuts, fennel, goat cheese, and chives.",
