    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCut the pita bread into squares and saute them with 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, for 5 minutes. Spread into a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nIn the same skillet, melt the remaining butter and saute the beef strips for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce, cover and let simmer until the beef is cooked; about 5 minutes.\nPour the beef mixture over the pita bread cubes. Cover with aluminum foil and bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes or until bubbly.",
