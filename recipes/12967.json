    "des": "\"This beef stew recipe requires very little prep time the day you're cooking it.  Cutting up vegetables ahead of time helps save time on this easy recipe.\"",
    "ins": "The night before, cut up potatoes and carrots and slice onions.  Put all the vegetables in a plastic container filled with water overnight.\nAlso the night before, marinate the stew meat with Worcestershire sauce and herb seasoning in a plastic storage bag.  Place in the refrigerator.\nIn the morning, put the raw beef in the bottom of your slow cooker.  Drain the vegetables, and pour in on top of the beef.  Pour in the stewed tomatoes and tomato juice.  If you like your stew a little spicy, add a chopped jalapeno pepper or two.\nTurn the slow cooker on high for 1 hour.  Then, set your slow cooker to low for 6-8 hours. The beef will cook completely, and will be very tender.",
