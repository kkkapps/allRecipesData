    "ins": "In a large stock pot, stir together the turkey drippings, water, turkey legs, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cover the pot; simmer until the turkey meat is starting to fall from the bones, about 30 minutes. Remove turkey legs, and pick the meat from the bones; return the leg meat to the soup.\nWhisk 1/4 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of milk in a bowl until smooth, and stir the mixture into the soup. Return soup to simmer, stirring constantly, and cook until thickened, about 30 more minutes. Mix in the cubed cooked turkey meat, red potatoes, onion, carrots, and celery; cover the pot again, and simmer until the celery is tender, about 30 more minutes.",
