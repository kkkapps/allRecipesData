    "des": "\"I've taken my old chocolate zucchini cake recipe, cut out almost all of the bad stuff and loaded it up with so many fruits and vegetables that it's more like a baked salad than a cake. The funny thing is that it turned out so moist and tasty that you'll find yourself fighting with the kids for the last piece. Try it once and you'll be a believer too!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, baking powder, and cloves in a bowl; set aside.\nBeat together the eggs, sugar, applesauce, vegetable oil, apple juice concentrate, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until smooth. Stir in the dry mixture alternately with the milk, then add the zucchini, carrot, raisins, and dates; stir until just moistened. Pour into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack.",
