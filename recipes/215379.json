    "ins": "Combine potatoes, potato water, butter, sugar, salt and hot water in large mixing bowl.  Stir until butter melts; set aside and let cool.  Combine yeast and 1/2 cup warm water in small bowl. Let rest 5 minutes. Add eggs, 2 cups flour and yeast mixture to potato mixture. Beat until well mixed. Continue adding flour, 1 cup at a time until soft dough forms.\nKnead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic (about 4 to 6 minutes), OR knead with electric mixer using dough hook. Place in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover.\nLet rise in a warm, draft free area about 1 hour, until doubled in size.  Punch dough down; divide in half.\nRoll one portion of dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12 x 18-inch rectangle.  Spread with half the butter.  Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle half of the mixture over surface.    Roll up tightly lengthwise, sealing edges.  Cut into 12 slices.  Place in greased 13 x 9-inch pan.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Cover.\nLet rise 30 to 45 minutes until nearly doubled.\nBake in preheated 350 degrees F oven for 25 to 30 minutes.\nCool for 15 minutes.  Combine icing ingredients and drizzle over rolls.",
