An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pork from grill and cover with aluminum foil; let rest for 5 minutes. Slice pork and place on a serving platter.\nMelt butter in a skillet over medium heat; add apples. Cover skillet and cook for 5 minutes. Stir apples and sprinkle with sugar; reduce heat to low.
