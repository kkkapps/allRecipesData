    "des": "\"Simple Lebanese style lamb kibbee. It's a traditional basic recipe. Kibbee is to Middle Eastern cooking what a meatball is to Italian cooking. If you can not make it, stay out of the kitchen. I am not Lebanese by the way, but worked for 2 decades in a restaurant serving this type of food. I am actually Ukrainian.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch square baking dish.\nSoak bulgur in hot water until the bulgur expands and cools, about 10 minutes. Place the bulgur, mint, allspice, pepper, cinnamon, salt, onion, parsley, and lamb in a food processor. Process until well mixed, about 1 minute. Divide the lamb mixture and layer half in the baking dish, creating a large patty. Sprinkle pine nuts over the meat, then layer the remaining lamb on top, patting firmly. Cut the kibbee into 1 1/2 inch squares.\nBake in the preheated oven until the lamb is no longer pink in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
