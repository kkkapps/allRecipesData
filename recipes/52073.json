    "des": "\"A different and yummy potato salad; it uses no mayonnaise.  This is a nice alternative to use arugula, rather than just adding it to a green salad.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and cool. Transfer to a large bowl.\nMeanwhile, mix vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl.  Drizzle in olive oil,  whisking until mixture thickens.\nToss potatoes with vinegar and oil mixture and arugula. Serve at room temperature.",
