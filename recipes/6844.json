    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix together the cake flour, sugar and baking powder.  Pour in the water and evaporated milk and stir well.  Mix in the eggs and butter or margarine.\nPour the mixture into molds or muffin pans. Find a baking pan that your muffin pan will comfortable fit in.  Pull the oven rack out a little (perhaps 1/4 out of the oven) and place the baking pan (with the muffin pan inside it) on the rack. VERY CAREFULLY pour about 4 cups of hot tap water into the baking pan which holds the muffin pan. Then VERY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY slide the rack completely into the oven.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.  Be VERY CAREFUL not to burn your hands with hot water or steam when you remove the muffins from the oven. Top with grated cheese.",
