    "des": "\"This is an adaptation of my Mom's recipe.  A very colorful salad that's great any time of the year.  A light creamy salad dressing can be substituted to reduce calories. I've also substituted frozen shrimp for canned on occasion, depending on availability.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and rinse in cold water.\nIn a large bowl, combine pasta, green pepper, red pepper, onion, celery, olives and shrimp. In a separate bowl mix together: salad dressing, mustard, sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper; pour over salad.  Can be served immediately, but best when chilled a few hours.",
