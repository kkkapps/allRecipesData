    "des": "\"This cauliflower dish is very simple and mild in taste. It is inspired by Momofuku Ko's skate dish. They used this cauliflower, olive, and water chestnut combination as the side dish. I was blown away - the crispy texture of water chestnut works perfectly with the soft and earthy taste of the cauliflower.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add 1 teaspoon salt. Cook cauliflower chunks in the boiling water until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Cut into bite-size chunks.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cauliflower; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in water chestnuts and olives. Add water; cook until water evaporates, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
