Toss with the apples in a mixing bowl.\nPour the mixture into the first unbaked pie shell then drizzle the caramel topping over the top.  Sprinkle with pecans.  Place the second pie shell over this and flute the edges.  Cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape then place on preheated cookie sheet.\nBake 45-50 minutes, until golden brown.  Cool for 1 hour before slicing.  Top with whipped topping, if desired.",
