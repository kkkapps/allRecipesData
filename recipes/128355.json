    "des": "\"A staple for me in college, this is a sweet, salty, nutty dish that can be cooked up in less than 15 minutes.  Measurements for the sauce can be adjusted for your taste, but with these ingredients, you can't go wrong!  I use pre-washed, pre-cut broccoli florets to cut down on prep time as well.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, mix together the peanut butter, soy sauce, black vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil.  Set aside.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in the udon noodles and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the frozen shrimp to the pot of boiling noodles and cook for about 3 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and opaque.  Turn the stove off, but do not remove pot from the heat.  Stir in the broccoli, cover, and let sit for 2-3 minutes.\nDrain the noodles, broccoli, and shrimp.  In a large serving bowl, toss together the noodles, broccoli, shrimp, and the peanut butter sauce.  Garnish with chopped peanuts.",
