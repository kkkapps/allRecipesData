    "des": "\"This hearty beef and vegetable stew that can be made in the slow-cooker is a family favorite.  It is also the backbone for an excellent beef soup, if you actually find yourself with leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef in batches in hot oil until browned completely, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove browned beef cubes to a plate lined with paper towels, keeping skillet over heat and retaining the beef drippings.\nCook and stir onion, celery, and carrots in the retained beef drippings until just softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir mushrooms and garlic into the onion mixture.\nPour red wine into the pan; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Continue cooking the mixture until the wine evaporates, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the mixture.\nReturn beef to skillet with potatoes, basil, thyme, marjoram, and sage. Pour beef stock and tomato sauce over the mixture. Bring the liquid to a simmer.\nReduce heat to low and simmer until the beef is very tender and the sauce is thick, 4 to 6 hours.",
