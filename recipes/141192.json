    "des": "\"Delicious pork chops the entire family will love. You can use corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and season the crumbs to your personal taste. I sometimes add a teaspoon of garlic powder. The longer cooking time ensures moist chops.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDip pork chops into eggs then into the bread crumbs, coating evenly. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place coated pork chops in the skillet in a single layer, and cook until golden brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Cook them in batches if skillet isn't large enough. Place the pork chops in a large baking dish in a single layer.\nIn a saucepan, bring to a boil the tomato juice, brown sugar, vinegar, cloves, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Pour mixture evenly over the pork chops.\nBake in preheated oven uncovered for one hour.",
