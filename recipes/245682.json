    "des": "\"I came across an African sweet potato stew recipe a few years ago, and adapted it to suit our taste. It is very flavorful and just a bit spicy - just right for cold days! This recipe makes a lot of stew, so it may be halved for a smaller portion, but also freezes very well.\"",
    "ins": "Place onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic, ginger, cumin, salt, coriander, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes in a large slow cooker. Pour in water and stir to combine. Mix in sweet potatoes, tomatoes, chickpeas, and peanut butter.\nSet cooker to Medium-High, cover, and cook until sweet potatoes are tender and stew has thickened, about 6 hours. Stir in green beans, cover, and continue cooking until beans are heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.",
