Stir mustard into skillet.\nPour chicken stock into skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook at a boil until sauce has a cream consistency, 2 to 5 minutes.\nRemove skillet from heat. Whisk cold butter into sauce until butter is melted and sauce is shiny.",
