    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add the pork chops and return to a boil. Cook the pork chops at a boil for 5 minutes, remove, and set aside to cool. Remove 1 cup of the broth from the pot and set aside for later use. Once the chops are cooled to the touch, cut into bite-size pieces.\nReturn the water to a boil; add the pork liver to the pot and cook at a boil until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard the liquid. Set the liver aside to cool; cut into bite-size pieces.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the pork chops into the onion and garlic; cook and stir together for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes and reserved broth; cover and cook for 10 minutes. Stir the pork liver, garbanzo beans, raisins, and potatoes into the mixture; cover and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 10 minutes.",
