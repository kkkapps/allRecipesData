I have tried several variations including using a carrot cake mix with white chocolate chips and chocolate cake mix with butterscotch   chips - the variety is endless! Note: I haven't had a great deal of   success in storing these cookies more than one or two days.  They seem to toughen up rather quickly.\"",

Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven.  Remove from pan to cool on wire racks.",
