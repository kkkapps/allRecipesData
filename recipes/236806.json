    "des": "\"Shrimp and grits is a very simple recipe, but make sure you have everything ready before you start cooking the shrimp. They only take a few minutes to saut\u00c3\u00a9, so you don't have time to run and chop scallions or juice a lemon. Once everything is assembled, this recipe is a snap. To make things even easier, you can make the grits a bit ahead since they stay hot a very long time.\"",

Remove from heat and transfer bacon to a dish, leaving drippings in the skillet.\nWhisk 1/4 cup water, cream, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl.\nStir 4 cups water, butter, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a pot; bring to a boil.

Remove from heat and stir white Cheddar cheese into grits.\nPlace shrimp in a large bowl and season with Cajun seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.\nHeat skillet with bacon drippings over high heat.
