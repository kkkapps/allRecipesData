    "des": "\"The great thing about this recipe is that you can prepare everything the night before and just throw it in the slow cooker in the morning on your way out the door. When you get home you will have dinner waiting for you and your house will smell delicious! If you like extra spice then increase the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper. Serve with your favorite hot sauce.\"",
