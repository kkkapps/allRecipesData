Drain and return lima beans to the pot; cover beans with fresh water.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir bacon until crisp, about 5 minutes. Reserve about 2 teaspoons bacon drippings and drain bacon on paper towels.\nBring lima beans, bacon, and reserved bacon drippings to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beans are just tender, 40 to 60 minutes. Stir heavy cream and butter into bean mixture and cook until thickened, about 15 minutes more.
