    "des": "\"I substituted this dish for mashed potatoes as a low-carb alternative, and my husband said it was 'rockin' good.' Flavors of Parmesan, garlic, and chives brought cauliflower to a new level and we didn't miss the potatoes. This goes well with a nice grilled steak or London broil.\"",
    "ins": "Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover and bring the water to a boil. Place cauliflower and garlic in steamer and steam until soft, 10 to 15 minutes.\nRemove garlic cloves and smash with a fork; place smashed garlic with cauliflower into a pot.\nSmash butter and chives into cauliflower and garlic with a fork or potato masher until smooth.\nStir light cream into smashed cauliflower mixture.\nSprinkle Parmesan-Reggiano cheese onto cauliflower mixture; season with salt and black pepper.\nCook the cauliflower mixture over low heat to absorb the cream and melt the butter, about 12 minutes.",
