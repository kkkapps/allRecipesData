    "des": "\"Incredibly easy to make and crowd-pleasing! Originally served on fresh-caught salmon when visiting relatives in Seattle, Washington. Serve your beautifully colored salmon dish with a fabulous wilted bibb lettuce salad and pair with a Pinot Gris, 'Salmon's Best Wine Friend.' The texture and acidity of Pinot Gris is the perfect balance for salmon and other meaty fish. For dessert, fresh peach parfaits with peach brandy, brown sugar and vanilla bean ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nIn a bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Italian dressing, and chopped onion until thoroughly combined; set aside.\nSprinkle the salmon with seafood seasoning on both sides, and place skin-side down into the prepared baking dish. Spread the mayonnaise mixture over the salmon steaks, and sprinkle with bread crumbs.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fish is almost opaque all the way through (centers can be slightly red), 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven, sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, and return to oven until the cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10 more minutes.",
