    "des": "\"This recipe comes from a cooking demonstration I attended in Garmisch, Germany. So easy! You can add your own topper like sour cream or fresh chopped chives and olive oil. When reheating, add a little cream or milk.\"",
    "ins": "Place onion, potato, parsnip, sweet potato, yam, and fennel cubes into a large saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to a boil and stir in chicken bouillon cubes. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and reserve cooking broth.\nPlace vegetables and 1 cup of reserved broth into a blender, cover, and blend until smooth. Pour in cream and add salt to the soup. Pulse several times to combine. If soup is too thick, blend in more broth. Serve in bowls topped with a small dollop of sour cream.",
