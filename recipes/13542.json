    "des": "\"A tangy relish that's a nice variation on the more traditional cranberry sauce. Pippen or other tart green apples work well in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan combine the apple cider vinegar, chopped onion, chopped apple, golden raisins, sugar, lemon juice, chili, ginger, lemon peel, coriander and cloves. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, stirring frequently, about 25 minutes. Add the persimmons and simmer until the persimmons are tender about 5 to 10 minutes.\nRemove from the heat and let cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate chutney. May be made a day or two ahead.",
