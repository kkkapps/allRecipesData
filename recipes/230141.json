    "des": "\"Holidays are so much easier since I started making this slow cooker chicken and dressing. Making the dressing in the slow cooker frees up the ovens for other dishes on holidays. Sometimes I add the chicken; sometimes I don't. I often assemble it weeks in advance and freeze it; then I let it thaw in the refrigerator before putting it in the slow cooker.\"",
    "ins": "Mix crumbled cornbread with onion, celery, and butter. Lightly stir in sage, salt, poultry seasoning, black pepper, eggs, cream of chicken soup, and cream of mushroom soup until thoroughly combined. Pour chicken broth over the dressing to moisten.\nLayer half the dressing into a slow cooker, spread half the cooked chicken over dressing, layer remaining dressing over chicken, and top with remaining chicken.\nSet cooker on High and cook for 45 minutes. Reduce cooker setting to Low and cook at least 5 more hours.",
