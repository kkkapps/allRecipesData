    "des": "\"This is so good and reminds me of a real moist kind of a sweet quick bread.  Everybody asks for the recipe: this bread is moist, and easy to make too.  Note: If you are using frozen blueberries, you can thaw them in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  However, you need to increase the amount of blueberries to 3/4 cup.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.\nIn a medium bowl, toss blueberries in 2 tablespoons flour. Gently stir blueberries together with oats, nuts, 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, and salt.\nIn a large bowl, cream shortening. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in mashed banana. Add blueberry mixture to creamed mixture, and stir just until moistened. Spoon batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven until a wooden toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the center of the loaf, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan, and cool completely on a wire rack.",
