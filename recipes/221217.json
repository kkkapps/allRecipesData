    "des": "\"I requested this recipe after I had these fajitas at a graduation party. This marinade makes some of the most delicious chicken I've ever tasted, so it's still awesome if you forgo making fajitas and just use it to marinate your chicken breasts.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the lime juice, olive oil, garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, salt, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag.\nPut the chicken breasts into the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag.\nMarinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nRemove the chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Arrange chicken breasts in a baking dish.\nBake chicken breasts in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nShred chicken breasts with two forks to desired texture.",
