Line 6 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nAfter dough has risen, cut into 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a 3 foot rope, pencil thin or thinner. Twist into a pretzel shape, and dip into the baking soda solution.  Place onto parchment covered baking sheets, and let rise 15 to 20 minutes.\nPreheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nBake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
