    "des": "\"A cinnamon raisin batter bread with a sugar glaze just like the school cafeteria used to make. It is a yeast bread baked in a sheet, and cut into servings after cooling. This recipe has been passed down for generations.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, dissolve the white sugar in the warm milk, and sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Grease a 9z13 inch pan.\nWhisk the eggs into the yeast mixture. Combine the flour, salt and cinnamon; stir into the yeast mixture until smooth. Mix in raisins. Spread into the prepared pan, and brush the top with melted butter. Let rise until double in size, but don't let it run over the edge of the pan.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare the glaze by mixing the confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon of milk and vanilla extract in a small bowl until smooth.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown on the top. Drizzle with the sugar glaze., and cool before slicing and serving.",
