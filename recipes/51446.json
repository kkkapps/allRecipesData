    "des": "\"A moist not too sweet version of a figgy pudding but made with dates and minus the spices. You could try covering with buttered foil and steaming it for a even moister version. This can also be baked in a (28 ounce) can.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the dates and butter. Pour boiling water over them, and let stand until cool.\nWhen the dates have cooled, stir the mixture to break up any clumps. Mix in the brown sugar and egg until well blended. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; stir into the date mixture until just blended. Stir in walnuts. Pour into the prepared pan.\nBake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean.",
