    "des": "\"I love whole grains, but could find very few recipes with sorghum. I had some vegetables from the garden and decided to throw a few things together. It was delicious! Other grains and vegetables can be added depending on what you have on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Combine water and sorghum in a small pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until sorghum is tender yet firm to the bite, about 1 hour. Drain any excess water and cool, about 10 minutes.\nTransfer sorghum to a large bowl. Add tomatoes, celery, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic; toss to combine. Stir in Italian dressing and lemon juice. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill before serving, about 30 minutes.",
