    "des": "\"I got this recipe from a guy I fish with up north, I love them; they are absolutely great, and I can't get enough of them. \nWe call them 'Scooby Snacks' and usually have them around the campfire. Be sure your foil is good and sealed. When done, it will be puffed up like a pillow! You can use any white, flaky fish in place of walleye fillets.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.\nPlace walleye, skin-side down, in the center of one aluminum foil square. Brush fillet with butter; season with seasoned salt and garlic and herb seasoning blend. Place second aluminum foil square over the fish and fold edges of the two pieces of foil together to form a secure packet.\nCook on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 7 minutes per side.",
