    "des": "\"Here's an Italian classic that needs no adaptation to make it paleo.There are plenty of everyday meals that are paleo and many people don't realize it.  Broccoli rabe and sausage is one of them. Luckily for me it's also an Italian dish. This is a meal you will most likely find on an Italian restaurant menu. It should be made with olive oil, not butter, and you can ask to omit the shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. Although, darn, that stuff is good. Lemon zest brightens it and adds a subtle, yet significant flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Coat the bottom of a skillet with a thin layer of olive oil; heat over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage slices in skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes; add garlic and continue cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute more.\nAdd broccoli rabe to the skillet; season with lemon zest, red pepper, and sea salt. Drizzle olive oil over the broccoli rabe and toss to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the broccoli rabe is completely wilted, about 15 minutes. Squeeze lemon half over the sausage and broccoli rabe mixture.",
