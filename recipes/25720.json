    "des": "\"Oven roasted pumpkins and sweet potatoes with spicy puree and chicken stock for a warming winter treat.   You can peel the pumpkin but you don't need to because the skin goes very soft.  Garnish with bacon bits, creme fraiche, yogurt or julienned basil leaves.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a mortar or spice grinder, grind coriander, cumin, oregano, fennel, red pepper, salt and peppercorns into a coarse powder.  Blend in garlic and 1 tablespoon olive oil to form a paste.\nWash pumpkin, and cut into 2-inch wide wedges, scraping away seeds.  Peel potatoes and cut each potato lengthwise into 6 wedges.  Smear the pumpkin and the potatoes with the spice paste and place in a baking dish.\nRoast in preheated oven 30 to 40 minutes, until tender and just beginning to blacken at the thinnest points.\nMeanwhile, in a large pot over medium heat, cook the onion in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil until translucent.\nChop pumpkin and potatoes into smaller chunks and puree in a blender or food processor with some of the chicken broth until smooth.  Be sure to scrape the roasted spice paste off the baking dish and include it in the puree.  It may be necessary to deglaze the dish with a little chicken broth.\nPour the pureed vegetables into the pot with the onions, and stir in as much additional chicken stock as needed to achieve the desired consistency.  Heat through.",
