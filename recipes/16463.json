    "des": "\"This is a very simple, healthy and elegant salad that is inspired by Indian cooking.  The smoking though not necessary is highly recommended.  It can be served with any lean piece of grilled meat, poultry or fish.\"",
    "ins": "In a pot over medium heat, add the eggplant and water; cook until tender and the water evaporates. Mash the eggplant so no large chunks remain. Allow to cool completely.\nIn a large bowl, add the yogurt, mashed eggplant, green onions, cilantro, pepper and salt; mix well.\nTo smoke the salad, heat one piece charcoal over open flame until gray and reddish in color. Place a small square of aluminum foil in the eggplant salad (make room in the center for the foil). Place the hot charcoal on the piece of foil in the bowl. Add the margarine on top of the charcoal and cover salad bowl immediately. Allow to smoke  for 10 minutes; remove charcoal.\nChill the salad in the refrigerator and garnish with fresh chopped cilantro and sprinkle of paprika.",
