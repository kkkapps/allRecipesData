    "des": "\"This is a hearty and rich potato soup with cream and spicy andouille sausage. Serve with fresh garlic bread. Use Polish sausage in place of the andouille for a slightly different flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the butter and oil together in a large stock pot over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the butter and oil until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage slices; cook and stir another 5 minutes. Stir in the potatoes; cook and stir 15 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, and Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer and cook 10 to 12 minutes until the potatoes are tender. Mix in the spinach. Remove from heat. Top with Parmesan cheese.",
