    "des": "\"This is a delicious summer salad with a tropical flair that has been a family favorite my whole life, and probably longer. Pineapple, marshmallows, and whipped cream make this salad good as a side dish, or as a cool and refreshing dessert. Overnight refrigeration is the most important step to allow the marshmallows to fluff.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, pineapple, and 3 tablespoons of reserved pineapple juice. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold whipped cream and marshmallows into the mixture. Add more pineapple juice, if needed, without making it too wet.\nTransfer the salad to an attractive serving bowl, smoothing top with a rubber spatula or large spoon. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight. Serve chilled.",
