    "ins": "Cut bacon in half. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nMelt the chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30 second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).  Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Dip all but the last inch of each strip of bacon in the melted chocolate. Place bacon on waxed paper and allow to cool and harden before serving.",
