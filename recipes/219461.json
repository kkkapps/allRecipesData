    "des": "\"A meatloaf style turkey burger that's moist and flavorful. My kids love these burgers and don't realize it's a lighter  alternative to beef burger. My kids just slap on some mayo and head to town. Great served with lettuce, tomato, and your choice of condiments, with a side of chips or raw crispy veggies.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nMix the turkey, bread crumbs, onion, eggs, applesauce, chili powder, paprika, and kosher salt in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into 8 equal portions, then shape into patties.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange the patties in the skillet and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Place the browned patties on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Transfer the patties to a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBake the turkey burgers in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve the turkey burgers on the hamburger buns.",
