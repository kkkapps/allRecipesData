    "des": "\"This is for garlic lovers! Tiny pieces of garlic are fried in olive oil and served over pasta, then topped with Parmesan cheese. Don't be scared off by the amount of garlic used, it caramelizes and sweetens as it fries in olive oil. It has become a favorite in my family, including my kids.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nHeat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until a piece of garlic dropped into the oil slowly bubbles. Add the garlic, and cook and stir until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove garlic from the oil with a slotted spoon and set aside; reserve oil.\nTo serve, place the pasta onto individual serving dishes and sprinkle with fried garlic. Drizzle with a little of the frying oil and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Reserve remaining garlic-flavored oil for another use.",
