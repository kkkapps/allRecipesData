    "des": "\"Cauliflower and nutritional yeast add protein and vitamins while blending the cauliflower, Greek yogurt, low-fat sharp Cheddar, and chicken stock create a creamy texture. The sharp Cheddar plus spices maintain a nice cheesy taste. It's better than you might think.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 25 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Drain and transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish.\nBlend cauliflower, yogurt, chicken broth, and olive oil in a blender until smooth; pour cauliflower mixture into a saucepan over medium heat. Stir Cheddar cheese, nutritional yeast, mustard powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg into cauliflower mixture; cook and stir until cheese sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni; toss to coat.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Mix Parmesan cheese and panko crumbs together in a bowl; sprinkle over macaroni. Bake until Parmesan cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.",
