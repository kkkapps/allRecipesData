    "des": "\"This recipe has been handed down in my family. Now it is handed to me. It is a wonderful casserole. Has a wonderful mix of ingredients. The tradition is to add an ingredient as it is handed. I have added the canned mushrooms. This freezes wonderfully. Just mix, freeze, and when ready to serve, remove and bake. Lovely!\"",
