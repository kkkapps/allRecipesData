    "des": "\"Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must have at Hanukkah, but really are wonderful any time of year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best latke I've had. I usually end up having to make a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to these. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.\"",
    "ins": "Mix potato, onion, eggs, crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.\nPour enough vegetable oil into a skillet to fill about 1/2-inch deep; heat over medium-high heat.\nDrop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are evenly thick.\nCook in hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a plate lined with a paper towel.",
