    "des": "\"Spinach, crab, mushrooms, and lasagna are my hubby's favorite foods. Combine in the slow cooker and wow. I about shocked myself at how good this turned out! You can substitute real crab or shrimp for mock crab.  If you turn off the slow cooker and allow lasagna to cool after the 30 minutes after adding mozzarella cheese, it will stick together better!\"",
    "ins": "Pour half the jar of Alfredo sauce into the slow cooker; top with a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread a layer of spinach, a layer of mushrooms, and a layer of crabmeat, respectively, over lasagna noodle layer. Spoon half the cottage cheese and half the ricotta cheese over crabmeat layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with a final layer of noodles and Alfredo sauce.\nCook on High for 2 hours 15 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over lasagna on cook on High until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes more.",
