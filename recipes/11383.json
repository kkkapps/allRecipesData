    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCombine peanut butter(including peanut butter from box mix), shortening, oil and water in a large mixing bowl, blend until smooth. Adding one at a time, blend in sugar, brown sugar , eggs and vanilla, mixing well.\nIn a smaller bowl combine flour, salt, and baking soda.  When those are combined, add dry mix from boxed cookie mix to flour mixture and stir using a whisk to break up any lumps.\nCombine dry mixture a little at a time into wet mixture and mix well. It may become necessary to finish mixing dough by hand.\nRoll dough into 1 1/2 to 2 inch balls and place a baking sheet leave 2 to 2 1/2 inches between cookies. Cross-hatch dough balls using a fork to flatten to 1/2 to 3/4 inch thickness. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) about 7 to 10 minutes, until edges start to turn light brown. Remove from oven let stand for 5 minutes and transfer cookies to wire rack.",
