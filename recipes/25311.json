    "ins": "Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt and set aside for 30 minutes.  Rinse and pat dry.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Rinse and pat eggplant dry. Cook eggplant and zucchini in hot oil until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side; remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, reserving as much oil as possible in the skillet\nAdding more oil to skillet as needed and let it get hot. Cook potato slices in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side; remove with slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate, again reserving oil in the skillet.\nSaute onion and garlic in reserved oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in vinegar, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low; cook until liquid is reduced in volume and thick. Stir in tomatoes, lentils, 1/2 the juice from lentils, oregano and parsley.  Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 15 minutes.\nLayer about 1/3 of the eggplant, 1/3 of the zucchini, 1/2 the potatoes, 1/2 the onions, and 1/2 the feta into a 13x9-inch baking dish.  Pour tomato mixture over vegetables; repeat layering, finishing with a layer of eggplant and zucchini.\nCover and bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.\nStir butter, flour, and milk together in a small saucepan; bring to a slow boil, whisking constantly until thick and smooth. Season with pepper and nutmeg; stir.  Remove from heat, cool for 5 minutes, and stir in beaten egg.\nPour sauce over vegetables and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, for another 25 to 30 minutes.",
