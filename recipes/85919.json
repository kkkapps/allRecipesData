    "des": "\"Quick and delicious, this marinade can be prepared in the morning and forgotten about all day. It also works well with pork or beef, and can easily be doubled, tripled, or more. Add flare by cutting thin strips of orange rind and sprinkling on top right before serving.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix together orange juice, soy sauce, and garlic. Place chicken in bowl, and coat well with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill on medium heat to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C), and lightly oil grate.\nPlace chicken on grill, and cook, turning occasionally, about 25 minutes.",
