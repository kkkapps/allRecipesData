    "des": "\"This is a SUPER EASY AND FAST not to mention CHEAP and NO MESS way to make a beer batter for your fresh fish while camping. Using only beer, your freshly caught fish, some oil for your skillet, and shake and pour buttermilk pancake mix containers found in your local supermarket. Great for camping!\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\nPour beer into the pancake mix container in place of the water it calls for. Make the batter as thick or thin as you prefer. Close the lid, give it a few shakes, and boom it's done.\nDip fish into the batter using a pair of tongs, or if you want to dirty a dish, pour the batter in a bowl first. If you cut your fish into smaller pieces, you can toss them into the container, close the lid and shake it a couple of times, then carefully remove the coated pieces.\nRemove the fish from the batter using tongs, and place into the hot oil. Fry the fish until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.",
