    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nMix tomatoes, garlic cloves, salt, pepper, and olive oil in a large bowl; spread into a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nRoast tomatoes in the preheated oven until they are lightly flecked with brown spots and the garlic cloves are tender, about 45 minutes; remove from oven after 20 minutes and mash lightly with a spatula.\nAbout 5 minutes before tomatoes are done, place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add green beans, cover, and steam until just tender, about 5 minutes. Place steamed green beans into a serving dish and combine with roasted tomatoes to serve.",
