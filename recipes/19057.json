It is a sugar cookie crust with a milky layer of white chocolate and cream cheese, topped with your favorite fruit choices and a glaze!  Substitute any fruit you like for the strawberries, and any fruit juice or juice from any canned fruits you use for the pineapple juice.\"",

In a separate bowl, stir together flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt.  Beat flour mixture into butter mixture to form a stiff dough.  Press dough into a rectangle as large as the baking sheet.\nBake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light brown.\nFor the filling:  In medium microwave safe bowl, microwave vanilla chips and cream on high 60 to 90 seconds, or until chips are melted and smooth after stirring.  Beat in cream cheese with electric mixer until creamy.  Spread on cooled cookie crust.\nFor the topping:  Arrange sliced fruit decoratively over filling.
