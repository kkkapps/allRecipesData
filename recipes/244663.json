    "des": "\"Anytime I have a chocolate craving, my mind goes to brownies. Thick, rich, gooey brownies. Sadly, my brownie cravings could never be fully indulged by the lower calorie recipes I was using. So, I created my own!\n\n This egg-free, dairy-free, 100% vegan recipe contains applesauce and pumpkin puree instead of oil and eggs. It tastes just as decadent as the regular version!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.\nMicrowave chocolate and butter together in a large microwave-safe bowl in 10 second increments until chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. Stir sugar, pumpkin, applesauce, stevia, and vanilla into chocolate mixture. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to chocolate mixture; stir in chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center of dish comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool on a rack for 20 minutes.",
