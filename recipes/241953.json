    "ins": "Process cauliflower in batches by pulsing in a food processor until it has the consistency of rice.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute red bell pepper in hot oil until hot, about 2 minutes; add shallots and garlic and saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir cauliflower with the vegetables in the skillet; cook and stir until the cauliflower is hot, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPour chicken broth over the cauliflower mixture; season with salt and thyme. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir lemon zest and lemon juice into the mixture; continue cooking until the lemon flavor penetrates the cauliflower, about 2 minutes more.\nRemove skillet from heat, add olives and parsley, and toss to mix.",
