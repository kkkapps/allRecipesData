    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nArrange bacon slices on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.\nCombine maple syrup, peanut butter, and vanilla extract in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir until sauce is smooth and heated through, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep sauce warm.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk buttermilk, egg, and olive oil together in a separate bowl; slowly pour into flour mixture and whisk until batter is smooth.\nHeat a griddle or flat skillet over medium heat; spread melted butter on surface to coat. Arrange bacon slices about 2 inches apart on the hot griddle, working in batches if needed.\nSlowly pour batter over each bacon strip; cook until bubbles start to form on top and edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until other side is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with warm maple-peanut butter sauce.",
