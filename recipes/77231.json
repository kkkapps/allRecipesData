    "ins": "In a swanky punch bowl (a MUST), combine the vodka, grapefruit juice, pineapple juice, lemon-lime soda and ice, or ice ring. This punch is too good for the little punch glasses that come with the punch bowl so use your highball glasses, stand around the punch bowl and have a good time!",
