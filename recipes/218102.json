    "des": "\"Ethiopian chicken stew.\"",
    "ins": "Soak the chicken in 2 cups water and lemon juice in a large bowl for 10 minutes. Drain.\nPlace the onion, with no fat, in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until very dark, about 20 minutes. Stir in the butter, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, and ginger, then stir in 1 more cup of water. Add the drained chicken, stirring until well-blended. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the chicken is tender, about 1 hour. If a thicker stew is desired, whisk flour with 2 tablespoons of water, and stir into the pot; allow to simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in eggs; cook and stir until heated through, about 10 minutes more.",
