    "des": "\"This cake was a hit with the children and parents at our two-year-old's birthday party.  It is perfect for raw, vegan, gluten/wheat-free, refined sugar-free diets (and children who don't need sugar!).  This cake was inspired by a 100% watermelon cake we had the year before.\"",
    "ins": "To create the base tier of the cake, cut 3 slices of watermelon, 1 to 2 inches thick, crossways through the center of the melon. Trim the rind from the watermelon slices, and place the largest slice onto a cake plate. Alternate layering sliced strawberries, slices of cantaloupe, and slices of fresh pineapple; follow with the second-largest watermelon slice. Repeat once more to make a layered fruit stack that looks like a cake.\nThinly slice a few pieces of remaining melon and pineapple. With cookie cutters or a sharp knife, cut remaining fruit slices into decorative shapes. Decorate the cake tiers with the cut fruit shapes and remaining berries.\nRefrigerate until serving time. To serve, slice the cake with a sharp knife, one wedge at a time, and set the wedge onto a plate.",
