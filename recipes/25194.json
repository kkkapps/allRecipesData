    "ins": "Cut the flank steak into thin filets; about 1/4 inch thick and 3 inches wide.\nGenerously spread one side of each filet with mustard to taste. Place bacon, onions and pickle slices on each filet and form into a roll. Use string or toothpicks to hold the roll together.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat and melt butter. Place the rolls in the butter and saute until browned.\nPour in 2 1/2 cups of water and add the bouillon cube; stirring to dissolve the bouillon cube. Simmer the rolls for about an hour.",
