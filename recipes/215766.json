    "des": "\"This meatloaf is moist, delicious, and a great way to sneak in some vegetables to your weekday dinners.  Feel free to use whatever combination of meats based on your personal tastes or what's on sale at the supermarket.  This is an often-requested recipe in my house and my husband still doesn't know about the zucchini in this recipe!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nMix the ground beef, ground turkey, zucchini, onions, green bell pepper, egg, Worcestershire sauce, Cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, and ranch dressing mix until well combined. Form the mixture into a loaf in the middle of the prepared baking dish.\nStir together the ketchup and steak sauce in a small bowl. Pour the sauce over the top of the meatloaf. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
