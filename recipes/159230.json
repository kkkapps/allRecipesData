    "des": "\"I fell in love with this dish at my local Thai restaurant. Steamed spinach and baked tofu is smothered in a sweet peanut sauce. Serve over steamed white sticky rice. You can substitute chicken or other meat if you prefer.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the rice and 4 cups of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low; simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.\nIn a separate saucepan, whisk together the peanut butter, 1 cup hot water, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, and adding more hot water 1/4 cup at a time to maintain a pourable consistency.\nBring about 1 inch of water to a boil in a large pot. Place the spinach and tofu into a steamer basket and set over the boiling water. Cover and steam until spinach has wilted and tofu is heated through, about 7 minutes.\nTo serve, place spinach and tofu over white rice and smother in peanut sauce.",
