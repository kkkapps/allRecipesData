    "ins": "Place the bacon in a skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.\nToast the slices of whole wheat bread in a toaster, and spread a toasted slice with peanut butter and honey. Place the bacon on the honey, top with the remaining toasted bread slice, and serve.",
