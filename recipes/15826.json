    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Divide pastry dough in half and roll out. Fit one pastry circle into a 9 inch pie pan. Cut the other pastry circle into 1 inch strips for lattice top.\nCombine raisins and water in a large saucepan. Simmer over low heat until raisins are plump and tender, about 10 minutes.\nIn a separate saucepan, mix together sugar and flour. Whisk in milk, butter or margarine, and salt. Cook over medium heat until thick, stirring constantly. Stir raisins into milk mixture. Pour filling into pastry-lined pie pan. Cover filling with pastry strips in a lattice design. Crimp edges.\nBake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, until crust is golden brown.",
