    "des": "\"A delicious and fresh tasting pasta sauce. The fresh basil added at the end is essential. This sauce can be left chunky (which I prefer) or blended in a food processor to a smooth sauce. Serve spooned over cooked pasta with plenty of parmesan cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes, red pepper flakes, vinegar, and sugar into the onion and garlic mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the flavors blend to your liking, 45 to 60 minutes. Stir the basil into the sauce; season with salt and pepper.",
