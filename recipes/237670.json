Heat milk mixture over medium heat while whisking continually until bubbling and thickened, about 5 minutes.\nSprinkle Gorgonzola cheese into the milk mixture, stirring continually to melt the cheese into a sauce. Stir green onions into the sauce. Pour reserved water into the sauce; stir.\nPour sauce over the cooked pasta and toss to coat.",
