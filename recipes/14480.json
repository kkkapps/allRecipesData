    "des": "\"This is a simple way to make herbed vinegars. Herbed vinegars make great gifts and will last for over 6 months.  (Use approximately 3 sprigs of herbs for each 16 ounce bottle.)  Try using thyme, oregano, rosemary, chives, tarragon or fennel with different vinegars to make all kinds of variations.  Hint: If you use purple basil, the vinegar will taste great, and be a lovely shade of purple!\"",
    "ins": "Choose a 16-ounce bottle with a well-fitting lid or cork. Boil it to sterilize, then remove from 'water bath', empty of any water inside, and allow to cool to room temperature.\nIn a small saucepan, combine the vinegar with 1/3 cup of water and heat until the mixture begins to boil. Remove from heat.\nSlip about 3 sprigs of fresh rosemary into the cooled bottle.\nUsing a funnel and care (!), pour the hot (NOT boiling) vinegar into the bottle over the rosemary. Cover tightly with lid and store at room temperature.",
