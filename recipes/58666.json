    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add white sugar and confectioners sugar 1 tablespoon at a time while continuing to whip to stiff glossy peaks. Mix in the maple extract. Spoon meringue onto the prepared cookie sheets in 1 inch circles.\nPlace in the preheated oven, and immediately reduce the temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until cookies are dry and easy to remove from the paper.",
