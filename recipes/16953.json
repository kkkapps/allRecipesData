Mix in the salsa (you may want to add more to taste).\nPlace the tortillas between two damp paper towels and microwave on high for 1 minute.\nFill half of 1 tortilla with the chicken mixture and cheese, then fold the tortilla over the full half. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Arrange the quesadillas on a cookie sheet.\nBake the quesadillas in the preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until the cheese has melted.
