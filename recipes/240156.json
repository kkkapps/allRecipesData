    "des": "\"I love a brined turkey. When you think about cooking any poultry for more than two hours, you definitely want a bird that was packed in a saline solution or brined yourself. Never again will you have a dry turkey. The osmosis will make your bird tender and juicy. This recipe is good for turkeys between 12 and 22 pounds. Roast as desired.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a large pot; stir kosher salt and white sugar into the water to dissolve completely. Remove from heat and let cool somewhat before transferring to a large food-safe container large enough to hold the brine and turkey, but small enough to fit in your refrigerator. Pour 2 gallons cold water into the container; add rosemary sprigs, thyme sprigs, garlic, Allspice, and black pepper.\nGently submerge turkey into the brine; refrigerate for 12 to 36 hours.\nRemove turkey from the brine and rinse both inside and outside thoroughly. Discard brine.",
