    "des": "\"I got my picture in the paper for this one! My friends' husbands always fall in love with this when I bring it to parties! My 4 picky kids eat it! If you want to skip the charring step, simply tear the tortillas into fourths so they absorb the sauce better.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.\nSeason chicken with garlic salt. Arrange in the prepared baking dish. Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Cool, shred, and set aside.\nWith metal tongs, char each tortilla half over the open flame of a gas stove burner for about 1 minute, until lightly puffed.\nPour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce in the bottom of a medium baking dish, and arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer. Top with 1/2 the chicken, 1/3 cheese, 1/2 the sour cream, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce. Repeat. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with remaining enchilada sauce, and arrange on top of the layers. Sprinkle with remaining cheese, and top with any remaining enchilada sauce\nCover, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool slightly before serving.",
