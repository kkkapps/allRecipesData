    "ins": "Mix ground beef, 1/4 pound tomatillos, eggs, white rice, 3 cloves garlic, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.\nScoop 1 1/2 tablespoon of the beef mixture and roll into a meatball. Repeat with remaining beef mixture.\nCombine tomatoes, 1 onion, 3/4 pound tomatillos, chipotle peppers, and 3 cloves garlic in a blender; puree until smooth.\nHeat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add tomato puree; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth. Season broth with salt and pepper. Bring to a slow boil; reduce heat until broth is barely bubbling.\nLower meatballs carefully into the hot broth; simmer gently for 20 minutes.
