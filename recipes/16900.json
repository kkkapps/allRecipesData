    "des": "\"An absolute favorite of my meat-and-veggies-only man. This brings him home every time!! I love this recipe. Fuss-free preparation, but it takes some thinking ahead for cooking time. Tender beef simmered in roasted coffee. Absolutely delicious.\"",
    "ins": "Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Add the roast and sear on all sides until well browned; set aside.\nIn the same saucepan, melt the remaining butter, add the salt and onions and saute for 5 minutes. Return the meat to the saucepan and pour in the coffee and the mushrooms.\nBring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 hours, turning meat over halfway through cooking time.\nTo make gravy: Remove a cup of the coffee mixture from the saucepan, combine with the cornstarch, stirring until smooth, and return to the simmering pan. Mix well, remove from heat and serve.",
