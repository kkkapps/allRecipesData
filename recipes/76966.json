    "des": "\"My crab salad with fruity-salsa flavorings is simple and appealing. Sliced avocados anchor and enrich this lively, colorful dish. If possible, select lump or backfin crab. The larger the crab chunks, the fewer shell fragments to pick out.\"",
    "ins": "Gently mix all ingredients except avocado in a medium bowl. (Can be covered and refrigerated several hours.)\nWhen ready to serve, halve, pit, peel and slice avocado. Fan half an avocado on each plate and serve crab salad alongside.",
