    "des": "\"This is a great recipe a friend gave to my father two years ago. It is easy, and allows you to have more room in the oven for other holiday favorites. It is also the most tender turkey I've ever made. This rub is appropriate for a 12 to 14 pound turkey.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix 3/4 Italian dressing, cayenne pepper, black pepper, Creole seasoning, and garlic powder. Rub over turkey, using remaining Italian dressing to fill cavity. Allow turkey to marinate 8 hours, or overnight, before deep-frying as desired.",
