    "des": "\"My Mom's longtime recipe that she learned from my grandmother who has long passed on. Combines soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, dry mustard, garlic, as well as a few other simple ingredients to make a delicious sauce for sweet and sour cut ribs. Great over rice! Some say rice and this sauce is their favorite food! A Lechner family tradition!\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, mix the sugar, flour, salt, pepper, and mustard. Stir in the water, soy sauce, and vinegar.\nPlace the ribs in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, cook 10 minutes, and drain.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the ribs on all sides. Mix in the sauce mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes. Mix in the garlic, and continue cooking 15 minutes, or to desired doneness.",
