    "des": "\"My family and I love chicken wings, especially during football season. I just got tired of spending so much money on wings for our party that I decided to whip up my own version of Wing Stop's\u00c2\u00ae lemon pepper chicken wings. The ending result was an empty platter and pleased bellies.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nStir olive oil and lemon pepper together in a bowl.\nFry the chicken wings in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nToss hot wings with olive oil mixture to coat.",
