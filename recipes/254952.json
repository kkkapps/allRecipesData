    "des": "\"Very healthy and easy to make. The natural sweetness comes from the pumpkin and honey. The recipe makes a very small cake because I only had a little bit of leftover pumpkin. Created this primarily for Mom, who's watching her weight but loves cake.\"",

Gently press cashews into the batter for decoration.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan, 5 to 10 minutes.",
