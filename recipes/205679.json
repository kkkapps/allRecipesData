Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper; blend to combine.\nPrepare a saucepan with cooking spray and place over medium heat; cook the mushrooms in the hot pan until tender, 5 to 7 minutes; set aside.\nPrepare a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat; cook the cottage cheese mixture in the hot skillet until bubbles begin to form on the top. Flip the pancake and cook until browned on the bottom; remove from heat. Spread the mushrooms over one half of the pancake; top the mushrooms with the spinach, Canadian bacon, and feta cheese. Fold the other half of the pancake over the fillings like you would an omelet.",
