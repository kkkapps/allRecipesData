    "des": "\"The secret ingredient which makes this cacciatore stand out is pancetta, an Italian bacon. Once a specialty deli item, it is now readily available at most major supermarkets. The pancetta gives the sauce richness and body. I've also found that fresh basil leaves and baby portobello mushrooms make it my own. It is kid-friendly and fills the house with a wonderful aroma.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the pancetta until it begins to turn dark brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the pancetta pieces from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set aside.\nMix the flour, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes in a shallow bowl.\nPress the chicken thighs into the flour mixture, tapping off any loose flour.\nBrown the chicken thighs in the skillet with the oil and pancetta drippings, 8 to 10 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken thighs to a platter and keep warm.\nCook and stir the green bell pepper, sweet onion, and portobello mushrooms in the same skillet until the onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes.\nStir the basil, garlic, tomato paste, diced tomatoes with their juice, and red wine into the sauce.\nBring the sauce to a boil, and return the chicken and pancetta to the sauce. If sauce does not almost cover the chicken pieces, mix in more dry red wine.\nReduce heat to low, and simmer the chicken and sauce until the chicken thighs are tender and no longer pink inside, 35 to 50 minutes.\nIf you prefer a thicker sauce, whisk cornstarch with water and 1 tablespoon of the sauce, and stir the mixture into the skillet until thickened.\nAbout 15 minutes before serving time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water and bring to a boil.\nStir in the rigatoni and return to a boil. Cook uncovered over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still slightly firm, about 13 minutes; drain.\nTo serve, transfer the cooked rigatoni to a large platter and top with the chicken thighs.\nGenerously ladle sauce over the chicken and pasta, and sprinkle the dish with Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper. Serve any extra sauce on the side.",
