    "ins": "Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp and browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and reserve 1 tablespoon bacon grease. Crumble bacon once drained and slightly cooled.\nLine a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\nCombine sugar, syrup, and salt in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave oven until bubbling, about 4 minutes.\nStir bacon, pecans, reserved bacon grease, and vanilla extract through the sugar mixture; heat in microwave oven for 3 minutes more. Immediately add baking soda and stir just until foamy.\nWorking quickly, spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Let cool until set, about 15 minutes. Break into bite-size pieces.",
