    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBlend coconut, sugar, flour, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt in a food processor until combined, about 30 seconds.\nBeat egg whites in a bowl until soft peaks form.\nFold coconut mixture into egg whites until just combined.\nWet your hands. Roll spoonfuls of coconut mixture between palms to golf ball-size cookies; arrange on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake cookies in the preheated oven until coconut is slightly golden and toasted, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, 30 minutes.\nLine baking sheet with new piece of parchment paper.\nMelt chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.\nDip half of each cookie in the chocolate and place on the prepared baking sheet. Place in refrigerator until chocolate is set, about 15 minutes.",
