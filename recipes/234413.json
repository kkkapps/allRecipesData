    "des": "\"These chicken wings never disappoint. They get devoured as soon as they get put on the table. The sauce is rich and dark so they are great for Halloween parties, just call them glazed bat wings for the holiday.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nWhisk Worcestershire sauce, honey, oyster sauce, soy sauce, garlic, vinegar, thyme, sesame seeds, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a large bowl; add chicken wings and toss to coat completely. Let chicken marinate 30 minutes. Transfer chicken wings and marinade to a deep baking dish.\nBake wings in the preheated oven, turning and spooning marinade over wings every 20 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and sauce is thick and bubbling, about 90 minutes.",
