    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.\nArrange the zucchini in a single layer in the bottom of the prepared dish. Season the ground beef with the salt and pepper; spread gently over the layer of zucchini. Sprinkle the crushed potato chips over the beef. Scatter the jalapeno pepper over the chips. Place the cheese slices in a single layer atop the chips and jalapeno peppers.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cheese begins to melt, about 5 minutes; sprinkle the basil over the cheese and return to oven for another 5 minutes. Pour the water into the casserole dish; continue baking until the ground beef is cooked through entirely, about 35 minutes.",
