    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners and prepare the liners with cooking spray.\nPut squash into a roasting pan with cut sides down. Pour enough water into pan to fill 1/2-inch deep.\nRoast squash in preheated oven until flesh is easily pierced through with a fork, about 45 minutes. Remove roasting pan and reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nScoop hot squash into a large bowl and mash until no large chunks remain. Stir sugar and butter into the squash.\nWhisk flour, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and salt together in a bowl.\nBeat eggs, milk, sour cream, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stirring constantly, add a spoonful of squash mixture into the egg mixture to temper it before adding egg mixture to the squash mixture; stir.\nFold flour mixture into the squash mixture until just incorporated; spoon into muffin tins. Top each with a pecan half.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes.",
