    "des": "\"Restaurant style comfort food directly from Maine that is easy to make and wonderful to eat!! Any white fish such as haddock may be used in place of the cod. Serve with crackers and corn bread if desired!! The real person that deserves full credit for this recipe is a wonderful mother named Cathy that lives in Chicago and loves her son in Kansas!!\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon strips in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook bacon until crisp, then remove to paper towels to drain. Drain grease from the pot, reserving about 1 tablespoon. Set heat to medium, and fry onions in the reserved bacon grease until tender, about 5 minutes.\nAdd potatoes, and fill pot with just enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil, then cook until potatoes are almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add fish pieces, evaporated milk, whole milk, and butter. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Ladle into bowls, and top with crumbled bacon pieces.",
