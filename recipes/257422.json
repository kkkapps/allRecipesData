    "des": "\"Authentic holige is a dessert made in Karnataka, South India, during festivals and special occasions. This delicacy is traditionally made with a dough filled with either bele hoorna (dal stuffing) or kobbari hoorna (coconut stuffing). I tried and tested this raisin (drakshi hoorna) holige recipe and it was a big hit during a recent festival celebration at home. It tastes heavenly with a side of almond-flavored milk (badam milk).\"",

Sprinkle 1/4 cup whole wheat flour over a flat work surface. Roll 1 ball of dough out into a thin circle; place 1 raisin and date ball in the center. Wrap dough around the ball and pinch to seal.
