    "des": "\"These cookies are reminiscent of a white chunk macadamia nut cookie but better. Using slivered almonds instead of macadamia nuts is a more economical alternative. Follow baking directions. The cookies can be a little tricky to get right on the first pan. Unless the oven is preheated, they might not turn out. Note that these cookies don't bake well on airbake pans.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two cookie sheets.\nCream the margarine together with the white sugar and brown sugar in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time until thoroughly blended. Mix in the vanilla and almond extracts.\nStir the flour, baking soda, salt, and rolled oats together in a mixing bowl until well blended. Stir the flour mixture into the sugar mixture. Mix in the coconut, white chocolate, and macadamia nuts until evenly blended. Drop by tablespoonfuls 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until centers are set and edges are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool 3 minutes on baking sheets before removing to cool on a rack.",
