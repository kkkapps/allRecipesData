Pour milk into a separate wide, shallow bowl.\nDip each eggplant slice into milk and then press into the flour mixture. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Arrange breaded eggplant onto prepared baking sheet. Brush tops of eggplant slices with olive oil.\nBake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, flip, and continue baking until the eggplant slices begin to brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.",
