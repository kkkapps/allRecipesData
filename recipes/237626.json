    "des": "\"Very much like the hummingbird cakes, this recipe starts with a Betty Crocker\u00c2\u00ae cake mix for a quick and easy, moist, and tasty dessert. Garnish with pecan halves or coconut.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBeat butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cake mix, eggs, and water; mix until batter is just combined. Stir pineapple and bananas into batter. Fold pecans and coconut into batter; pour into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool cake in the dish for 10 minutes before turning onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.\nSpread cream cheese frosting over cooled cake.",
