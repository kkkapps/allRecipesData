    "des": "\"A refreshing yet hearty dinner salad with bacon, eggs, and vegetables, that takes no time to whip up! You can use any vegetables you have on hand, but the idea is to use 'green ones'. This recipe was passed on from my father-in-law to my husband. They have a Dutch name for it which means 'good stuff', which it is!\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Reserving a small amount of the grease, drain the bacon, crumble, and set aside.\nUsing the same pan, heat the reserved bacon grease to medium-high. Fry the eggs until yolks are cooked through, but still tender, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and cut into long strips.\nDivide lettuce among salad plates, and arrange bell pepper, green onion, cucumber, celery, and broccoli over lettuce. Top each salad with bacon, sliced eggs, and 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise. To be tossed on the plate once served.",
