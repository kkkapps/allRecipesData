    "des": "\"Delicious extra low-carb pancakes that are absolutely yummy. \n\nA special recipe that uses the microwave to quickly boil the almond flour to create pancakes that are soft and gooey like normal pancakes, not dry and bready like a muffin. Eat with sugar-free syrup, such as Log Cabin\u00c2\u00ae. Kids love them!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk water, almond flour, vegetable oil, cream, baking powder, and vanilla extract together in a microwave-safe bowl.\nCook in the microwave on high until gooey batter forms, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\nLet batter rest until cooled slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in egg until well-blended.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
