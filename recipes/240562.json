    "des": "\"The blue cheese in this recipe lends a creamy quality to the cottage cheese layer and only a subtle, pleasant touch of flavor. There is no mozzarella in this non-traditional lasagna that will have your guests waiting for the recipe handout. (Have it ready!) I have the habit of making way too much lasagna, so this recipe is perfect for keeping my portions under control for our now-empty nest with minimal leftovers. I believe this would work well in a slow cooker, but haven't tried it yet. Don't be afraid of the blue cheese flavor overpowering this recipe - it doesn't!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Coat the inside of a glass 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix spaghetti sauce and brown sugar into beef-pork mixture until sauce is well blended.\nCombine cottage cheese, blue cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and oregano in a bowl.\nSpread enough sauce into the bottom of the loaf pan to reach 1-inch depth. Break 2 lasagna noodles to fit the length of the loaf pan, slightly overlapping. Spread 1/2 of the cheese mixture over noodle layer. Layer 3 slices provolone, slightly overlapping, over cheese layer. Sprinkle 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over provolone cheese. Repeat layering with the remaining ingredients ending in a layer of sauce.\nPlace the loaf pan on the prepared baking sheet and top loaf pan loosely with a piece of aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cooked through, about 1 1/2 hours. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.",
