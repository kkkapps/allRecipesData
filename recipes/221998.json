Once the vegetables are cold, drain well, and set aside.\nCook garlic and butter in a large skillet over medium heat until garlic starts sizzling, about 3 minutes.\nStir in chicken broth, heavy cream, thyme, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper; cook until mixture begins to simmer, about 5 minutes.\nCoat a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil and spread vegetables evenly over the oil.\nPour broth and cream mixture over vegetables and top with half of the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\nCover baking dish loosely with aluminum foil, place on a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.\nRemove baking dish from the oven and top with remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano. Bake uncovered until vegetables are browned, bubbling, and tender, about an additional 30 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and let rest for 20 minutes.",
