    "des": "\"I wanted a delicious pancake breakfast that was also healthy and included protein because I love to lift weights and keep in shape. Looks like I found a keeper, and I hope you enjoy it too. There's no sugar, butter, or wheat, just sweet potato, banana, eggs, milk, oatmeal, and vanilla whey powder. It's great for anyone but especially bodybuilders who are adding mass or even cutting, depending on how you use this. Add a little maple syrup to your pancakes and say goodbye to unhealthy sweet-tooth cravings!\"",
    "ins": "Place rolled oats into a food processor and grind to flour. Place sweet potato into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until very soft, about 20 minutes. Drain.\nBlend sweet potato, eggs, banana, and milk in a blender until smooth; pour batter into a large bowl. Stir protein powder and ground oats into batter.\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over low heat. Drop batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, into the skillet, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
