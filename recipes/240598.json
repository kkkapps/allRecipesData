    "des": "\"This is a simple cinnamon recipe that my mom likes to call 'Helter Skelter.' She got this from a coworker in Norfolk, NE in 1976. It's called 'Helter Skelter' because you tear two loaves of frozen bread dough and place it 'helter skelter' in the baking pan.\"",
    "ins": "Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle walnuts into the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle about half the raisins with the walnuts.\nTear one bread dough loaf into pieces; add to baking dish and top with remaining raisins.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir brown sugar, pudding mix, milk, and cinnamon with the butter; cook, stirring frequently, until the dry ingredients dissolve completely and the mixture thickens into a caramel-like sauce. Drizzle the sauce over the bread in the baking dish.\nTear remaining dough loaf into pieces and arrange into he pan, filling any empty spots with dough pieces.\nLet the dough raise for 2 1/2 hours to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven until no longer doughy in the center, about 30 minutes. Cool rolls in pan for 15 minutes.\nTurn the rolls out onto a serving platter large enough to contain the sauce that will run off the rolls.",
