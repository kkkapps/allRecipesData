    "ins": "Dip the rim of a chilled 1-pint mug or schooner into coarse salt, and fill the mug with ice cubes. Add 1/4 teaspoon of salt, lemon juice, hot pepper sauce, and soy sauce. Pour in the tomato and clam juice cocktail, top up the mug with beer, and stir gently. As you drink, you can keep topping up your mug with more beer.",
