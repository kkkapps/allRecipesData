Pour chicken broth and wine over rice mixture.\nBrush chicken breasts evenly with mayonnaise; sprinkle rosemary, salt, and pepper over each coated chicken breast. Arrange chicken breasts carefully atop the rice mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, at least 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
