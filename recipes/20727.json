    "des": "\"I brought this treat to my family after working as a Girl Scout leader. It's a great way to let kids make their own meal.  You may make these packages as large as you want for hearty appetites, allowing a little more time for cooking.  This is great for pool parties, camping, etc.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly grease one side of a large piece of heavy foil.\nForm ground beef chuck into a patty, and place in the center of the foil's prepared side. Arrange potato, carrot and sweet onion around the beef. Top with butter. Salt and pepper to taste. Tightly seal the foil around the beef and vegetables.\nPlace the sealed foil packet on the prepared grill. Turning frequently, cook approximately 30 minutes, or to desired doneness.",
