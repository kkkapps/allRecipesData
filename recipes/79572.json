    "des": "\"This rich and creamy pumpkin-pie ice cream is vegan! You can make the recipe with all soy milk instead of soy creamer. It would be healthier, but less creamy and decadent. You can also use rice, almond, or another non-dairy milk instead of soy. Please note that while the prep and cooking times are short, you will need to let the liquid cool and then freeze it, which will take additional time.\"",
    "ins": "Mix 1/4 cup soy creamer with arrowroot and set aside. Whisk together 1 3/4 cup soy creamer, soy milk, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until just boiling. Remove the pan from the heat; stir in the arrowroot mixture to thicken. Set aside to cool for 30 minutes.\nFill cylinder of ice cream freezer; freeze according to manufacturer's directions.",
