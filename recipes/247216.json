    "des": "\"This is a really inexpensive (under $2!) and easy brownie to make. I had to come up with a last-minute dessert so I took a brownie mix I had in the cupboard and decided to dress it up a bit. This was the result, which was a hit.\"",

Grease an 8-inch square pan.\nCombine brownie mix, egg, vegetable oil, coffee-flavored liqueur, instant coffee, and water in a large bowl; mix with a wooden spoon until batter is evenly moistened.\nPour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges are set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 20 to 30 minutes before cutting.",
