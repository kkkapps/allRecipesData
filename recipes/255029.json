    "des": "\"Tender pork ribs are oven-grilled, then stir-fried in a sticky, sweet and sour spicy sauce. This serves 2 for a main course or 6 for a starter.\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; set a baking rack on top.\nRub salt and pepper over the pork ribs; place on the prepared baking sheet.\nCook in the preheated oven, flipping once, until meat pulls away easily from the bone, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nHeat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add celery, ginger, and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Mix in soy sauce, chile pepper, sake, tomato puree, sugar, balsamic vinegar, and salt; stir until sauce is combined. Remove from heat.\nToss pork ribs in sauce until coated.",
