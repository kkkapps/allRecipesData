    "des": "\"A colorful California version of this classic Greek sauce. Use on your favorite pita sandwich, gyro, falafel or as a fresh veggie dip. Also try it as a condiment for spicy Indian food and curries. Make it using yogurt in place of sour cream, or even without the sour cream for a great vegan alternative!\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine the avocado, garlic, lemon juice, sour cream and cucumber. Mash with a fork until smooth. If your avocado is not quite ripe enough, you may wish to use a food processor. Season with red pepper flakes, cilantro, mint, salt and pepper, and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.",
