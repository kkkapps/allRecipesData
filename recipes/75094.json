    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). lightly grease two baking sheets.\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Rub in the butter using your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the cheese, egg yolks, Cajun seasoning and mustard, and mix until it comes together. Knead for a few turns to be sure the cheese is evenly distributed.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, and about 7x10 inches. Cut into thin straws using a chef's knife or pizza cutter. Place straws onto the prepared baking sheets, and straighten them out as best you can.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly toasted. Cool on wire racks.",
