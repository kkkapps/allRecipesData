    "des": "\"This is the absolute best Southern cake recipe ever. A friend of mine gave me this, and said her momma from Georgia gave it to her. We call it 'Nasty Cake' because it is so good, but has so many calories. This is not for those trying to watch their weight! Use a deep cake pan.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare batter and bake cake as directed on the package.\nAbout 5 minutes before the cake is finished baking, melt the butter in a large saucepan to allow for foaming, and stir in the evaporated milk. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, and stir in the corn syrup and sugar. Bring back to a boil, stir to dissolve sugar, turn off the heat, and add the baking soda. Stir continuously until the baking soda is mixed in and stops foaming, about 2 minutes.\nRemove the cake from the oven, and poke holes in the hot cake with a butter knife or the end of a wooden spoon. Pour the syrup over the hot cake, and let cool before cutting.",
