    "des": "\"I was looking for a lower-calorie way to make my husband's favorite summer side dish, as my traditional potato salad was laden with eggs and mayo! The tzatziki dip as dressing certainly did the trick! The tarragon in the onions gives that hint of 'what is that?' to this recipe! Can be served warm or chilled.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and cool. Cut potatoes in half.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until softened and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Add tarragon; pour in white wine to deglaze pan. Simmer until wine evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.\nMix potatoes, onion, and bacon together in a large bowl. Fold tzatziki sauce, chives, salt, and black pepper into potato mixture.",
