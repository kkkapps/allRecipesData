    "des": "\"This is a very popular recipe around my house and yields the best mussels in cream and wine sauce that I've ever had. Easy, fun and a wonderful treat.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan, combine the onion, bay leaf, garlic, carrot, fish stock, and wine. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 5 minutes to soften the carrot and onion.\nAdd the mussels to the boiling mixture, cover, and cook over high heat until the mussels open, about 5 minutes. Shake the pan occasionally to help them cook evenly.\nAs soon as the mussels have opened, remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove the bay leaf from the broth, and stir in the heavy cream. Heat through, but do not boil. Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Salt may not be necessary depending on the saltiness of your fish stock.\nPlace mussels into serving dishes, and spoon broth over them to serve.",
