    "des": "\"A flavorful recipe that can be made either with bison or without bison as a vegetarian stand-alone. For the vegetarian version use 3 portobello mushrooms and 2 tablespoons olive oil instead of 1. Requires the barley to be soaked at least 24 hours in advance.\"",
    "ins": "Place barley into a large bowl and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 24 hours. Drain.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bison in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir soy sauce, garlic, thyme, oregano, and pepper into bison; reduce heat to medium-low. Add olive oil and stir.\nMix mushrooms, barley, and Worcestershire sauce into bison mixture; stir gently. Pour wine over mixture just until barley is covered. Cover skillet, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Cook until barley is tender, stirring every 10 minutes, 30 to 35 minutes.",
