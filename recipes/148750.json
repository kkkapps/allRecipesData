    "des": "\"This is a vegetable version of the classic Thai Tom Yum soup. You can find lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal (a close relative of ginger) at any Asian supermarket.  If you can't find the lime leaves, you can add extra lime juice to taste, but do try to find the lime leaves because they make a big difference.  It tastes just like my local Thai restaurant!\"",
    "ins": "Bring chicken stock, galangal, lime leaves, lemon grass, and hot chile paste to a boil in a large pot. Stir in fish sauce, lime juice, shallots, tomato, mushrooms, bok choy, and carrot. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and green onion before serving.",
