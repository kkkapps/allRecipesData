    "des": "\"Eat to your heart's content the day after and/or freeze in several units. Take out of the freezer, and heat in the zapper or in a double boiler. Enjoy that T-Day turkey until New Year's. Despite the name it is a really great soup that my sister friend shared with me. Guess what her name is! Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.\"",
    "ins": "Pick your Thanksgiving turkey nearly clean. (Turkey salad is great for a few days, or even turkey pot pies.) We are not real concerned about the choice meat here. Dump the turkey and all of its debris, including the juices, into a large pot. Add  green beans, celery, spinach, cabbage, and white rice. Pour in enough water to cover everything.\nBring soup to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for an hour or so. Add more water as needed.\nRemove all turkey bones and unwanted debris (i.e., skin, cartilage, etc.). There you have it. It's kind of a culinary scrapbook of your Turkey Day.",
