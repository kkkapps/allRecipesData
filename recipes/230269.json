    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nPlace chicken breast halves, drumsticks, and thighs in a large bowl (see Cook's Note). Add browning sauce and olive oil, tossing to coat. Season with salt and paprika to taste.\nArrange chicken pieces in one layer on the bottom of a roasting pan. Top with sliced onions. Cover and bake for 5 hours, basting with pan juices every hour. The onions will release some liquid; if mixture looks dried out, add a small amount of water.\nTransfer chicken and onions to a platter and serve with extra pan juices as gravy.",
