    "ins": "Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In a medium bowl, cream the white sugar, brown sugar, and the butter together until smooth. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Add the flour mixture, and stir until just combined.  Stir the crushed cookies into the dough. Cover, and chill the dough for 1/2 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nDrop dough by rounded spoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove to cool on wire racks.",
