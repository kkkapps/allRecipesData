    "ins": "Brown the sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain and set aside.  Prepare grits according to package directions using water, not milk. As the grits thicken, stir in the salt and garlic powder.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the cooked grits to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix in the egg and 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese. Mix the sausage into the grits, then sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese over the top.\nBake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.",
