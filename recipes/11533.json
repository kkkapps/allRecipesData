    "des": "\"This recipe is adapted from my great-grandmother's recipe, that is over 100 years old.  I had to wait 40 years before my mother would share this recipe with me. This recipe tastes similar to the windmill cookies that they used to sell in our grocery store-but my family thinks that this version is much more flavorful and softer.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the melted butter, melted lard, white sugar, brown sugar, and eggs. Mix until well blended. Stir in the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and almonds. Roll the dough into 2 logs about 2 1/2 inches in diameter; refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Let the dough logs thaw for about 5 minutes.\nSlice dough into slices about 1/4 inch thick. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Alternative: You can use a cookie stamp, mold or press for these cookies-after you have chilled the dough, roll out the dough to 1/2\" thick and press down on the down to 1/4\" thickness.",
