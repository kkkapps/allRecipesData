    "ins": "Preheat broiler to 500 degrees. Coat a broiling pan with nonstick cooking spray. Brush both sides of fillets with lemon juice, and then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place fillets flat side up on prepared pan.\nIn a small bowl, mix Parmesan cheese, butter, and mayonnaise.\nBroil fish about 4 inches from heat for 6 minutes.
