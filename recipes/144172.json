    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray, and set aside.\nCombine the flour, dry milk powder, baking powder, cardamom, and salt in a  bowl. In another  bowl, stir together warm milk, honey, oil, and vanilla extract. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture, and stir a few times, until just combined.\nGather the dough together and turn out onto a floured surface. Gently pat the dough into a 9x3 inch rectangle, and cut the dough into 3 3-inch squares with a sharp knife. Cut each square on the diagonal to make 6 triangles, and place the triangles onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBake for 6 minutes in the preheated oven, remove from oven, and sprinkle the tops of the biscuits with turbinado sugar. Return the biscuits to the oven, and bake for 8 more minutes. Let cool on rack before serving.",
