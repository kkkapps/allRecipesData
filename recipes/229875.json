    "des": "\"My Romanian family all make some version of this dense apple walnut cake every autumn. I think it's common to Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians too. I'm so pleased that I could almost replicate the taste and texture without wheat! Coconut flour can be substituted for almond flour. Makes a 9x13-inch pan. When cool, you can dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan; lightly flour with gluten-free flour.\nWhisk sorghum flour, almond flour, rice flour, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.\nWhisk sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until incorporated and batter is thoroughly combined. Fold in apples and walnuts. Pour and press batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.",
