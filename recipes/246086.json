    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook ground beef until browned and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer cooked ground beef to a plate to drain; reserve remaining oil in skillet.\nReturn skillet to medium heat with residual oil. Add onion, garlic, and curry powder; cook and stir until onion is almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir cooked ground beef and cabbage into onion mixture; stir in ketchup, chutney, and salt. Sprinkle on a little water to prevent burning, but not enough to make the curry wet.\nCook and stir until cabbage is just tender and flavors have combined, 7 to 10 minutes more.",
