    "ins": "Spread 1/2 the mayonnaise onto one side of a slice of bread and place, mayonnaise-side down, in a skillet. Place American cheese and pepperjack cheese on top of the bread. Spread remaining mayonnaise onto one side of the remaining bread and place, mayonnaise-side up, on top of the cheese.\nCook sandwich in the skillet over medium heat until cheese melts and the bread is golden brown, about 2 1/2 minutes per side.",
