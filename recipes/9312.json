    "des": "\"This is the cookie recipe my husband grew up on.  His mother would make these every year for Christmas. These cookies freeze well and keep a long time. You will need somewhere between 16 and 20 cups of flour for this recipe, use as much flour as necessary to stiffen the dough.\"",
    "ins": "Grind the nuts, raisins, currants and citron. Boil the molasses and the sugar. Let cool then add the ground mixture, the eggs, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, anise oil, sour milk and baking soda. Add enough flour to stiffen dough. Refrigerate dough for several days.\nWhen ready to bake preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dough may be rolled out to 1/4 inch thick and cut with cookie cutters or you can shape dough into logs and slice. Place cookies on greased cookie sheets and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.",
