    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) Line a deep dish pie pan with pastry dough. Line dough with foil, fill with uncooked beans or something similar (this will keep the sides from falling as it bakes). Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven.\nReduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nIn a large sauce pan, combine pecans, brown sugar, white sugar, cream and butter. Cook until it reaches 230 degrees F (110 degrees C)  on a candy thermometer.\nRemove foil and beans from pie shell. Pour praline mixture into pie shell.\nBake at 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) for 20 minutes. I cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foil so crust won't burn. Serve warm with whipped topping, if desired.",
