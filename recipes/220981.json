    "des": "\"This fruit salad is simple, colorful, refreshing, and a little tangy (due to the mandarin oranges), great to bring to potlucks and picnics. I served it at Easter supper this year to counteract all that candy. Shredded coconut can be sprinkled on top for a sweeter salad.\"",
    "ins": "Layer about half the cantaloupe in the bottom of a large bowl; top with layers of about half the apple slices, half the grapes, and half the mandarin oranges in juice. Repeat the layering.\nTop the salad with coconut to serve.",
