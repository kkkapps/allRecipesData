    "des": "\"This comfort food favorite has been passed down in my family. I remember getting so excited every time my grandfather would make it for us! Although I loved the way my grandfather made it, I've added a few flavorful ingredients of my own. You'll love the bacon, potatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, and bella mushrooms in a potato bake covered with melted Cheddar cheese. Even extra tasty when served with sour cream! This dish is an excellent side dish at dinner or a wonderful addition to a brunch!\"",
