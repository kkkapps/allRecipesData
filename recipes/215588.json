    "des": "\"My own creation! This recipe is good for diabetics, but can easily be made as a non-diabetic dessert by using real sugar instead of a sugar substitute. This dessert is not super sweet, allowing the natural sweetness of the fruit to come through. If you like sweeter desserts, double the amount of the sugar substitute or sugar. You can use whatever sugar substitute is your preference.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish.\nMix white peaches, bananas, 2 tablespoons flour, and 1 teaspoon sugar substitute in a bowl until the fruit is coated; spread into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.\nWhisk 1 cup flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in the same bowl used to mix fruit; stir in skim milk, egg, corn oil, 2 teaspoons sugar substitute, and vanilla extract to make a batter. Pour batter in an even layer over the fruit.\nBake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake layer comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan on rack at least 20 minutes before serving.",
