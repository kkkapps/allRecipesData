    "des": "\"These cheesy little pastries are so delicious served warm right out of the oven. And since you can prep them well in advance, they only take a few minutes to pull together for your party. They're the perfect hot, crispy appetizer to go with a glass of wine or bubbly.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oven to 400F.\nBeat egg yolk, mustard and water until blended; stir in garlic. Roll pastry sheet into 14x10-inch rectangle on lightly floured surface; cut lengthwise in half.
