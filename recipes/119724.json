    "des": "\"A peachy use of the season's bounty is Marilyn Schroeder's fruitful dessert. 'I bring this juicy crumble to get-togethers of all kinds,' she writes from Alexandria, Minnesota. 'Crushed macaroons make a delightfully different topping for the blueberries and nectarines. For a special treat, serve it with low-fat frozen yogurt.'\"",
    "ins": "Peel nectarines and remove pits; cut fruit into 1/2-in. slices. Place in a bowl; add the blueberries, sugar and nutmeg. Drizzle with lemon juice; toss lightly. Transfer to a shallow 3-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray.\nIn a bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter and egg white; mix well. Stir in macaroon crumbs and oats. Spoon over the fruit mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly around the edges.",
