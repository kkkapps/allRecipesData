    "des": "\"Umm Mm good! Peanut and curry are blended together for a very unique and creamy textured soup. It goes great with some warm sourdough bread and a light salad since it's such a rich and hearty soup! This is a very unique and definitely different recipe, but definitely will be a staple for our household!\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large sauce pan over medium heat. Cook the celery and onion in the butter, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another 2 minutes. Stir in the flour, curry powder, and red pepper; cook and stir 1 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 20 minutes, stirring frequently. Mix in the coconut milk and peanut butter; continue to heat while stirring until completely heated through. Remove from heat.\nPour the soup in small batches into a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Pour into bowls and garnish with chopped peanuts to serve.",
