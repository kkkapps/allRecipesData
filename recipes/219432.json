    "des": "\"Apple pie is my favorite pie. I make it for holidays and just because sometimes too. I wanted to cut out some of the fat from the butter so I cut it down and eliminate the sugar. It makes it caramel and better for you.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.\nPlace the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work of crust.  Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust.  Pour slowly so that it does not run off.\nBake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.",
