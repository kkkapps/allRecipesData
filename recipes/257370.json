    "des": "\"I'm a meateater, but my girlfriend is vegan, so I created this recipe as something we could enjoy together. Using a meat substitute and bold flavors, even the most carnivorous of your guests won't guess these pot stickers are meatless, let alone vegan.\"",
    "ins": "Mix vegetarian beef crumbles, napa cabbage, soy sauce, green onion, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl to make filling.\nPlace a spoonful of the filling in the center of each pot sticker wrapper. Brush edges of each wrapper with water; fold over to enclose filling. Squeeze edges and crimp together to seal.\nHeat peanut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place potstickers flat-side down in the skillet; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip potstickers. Pour in 1/4 cup water; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking until water evaporates, about 5 minutes.",
