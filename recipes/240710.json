    "des": "\"This is my father-in-law's famous 'top secret' pork chop marinade. Top secret means that he shared it with everyone the last 20 years, even my brother, who is no relation to Virgil, but he would never share with me until recently. I gave him so much grief about it that he finally shared it with me. I know what you're thinking, 'Virgil didn't share it with you because he didn't want it blabbed on the internet.' Nope. He only did that to pester me. This is a very good marinade that was developed by Virgil and his brother specifically for pork chops, but also works on beef and chicken.\"",
