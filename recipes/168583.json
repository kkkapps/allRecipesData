    "des": "\"This unique tomato sauce combines the best of the Mediterranean - including roasted red peppers, balsamic vinegar, and kalamata olives - into a sweet, tangy sauce perfect for breezy summer nights.\"",
    "ins": "Stir the tomatoes, olives, red pepper, garlic, vinegar, sugar, olive oil, oregano, and black pepper in a large saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, 20 to 30 minutes.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nOnce the tomato sauce is ready, pour into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree until smooth, then return to the pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the sauce right in the cooking pot. Stir in the burger crumbles, and simmer until hot. Pour the sauce over the cooked penne to serve.",
