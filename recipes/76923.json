    "des": "\"Why make my homemade 'instant ice cream' when buying good strawberry ice cream is equally instant? You have to taste this frozen treat to know why. It's half sweetened strawberries and half cream, so the ratio of fruit is extraordinarily high, giving this ice cream an amazingly fresh strawberry flavor. It's not smooth, but what it lacks in creaminess, it more than makes up in fruit-flavor punch.\"",
    "ins": "Place berries in blender. Whisk sugar into cream. With blender going, slowly add cream through opening in lid, stopping to stir the mixture 3 or 4 times so the ice cream is smooth, with small bits of berries.\nTransfer to shallow pan and freeze to a scoopable texture, about 2 hours. Garnish with fresh strawberries, if you like.",
