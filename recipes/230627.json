    "des": "\"Not your regular meatloaf! This sweet and savory loaf is enhanced with the textures of raisins and almonds and the spiciness of curry. Pleasantly different. If using high quality curry, use 1 1/2 tablespoons; most store bought curries are not as flavorful so use more. If looking for more sweetness, try adding apricot preserves or a fruit chutney.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish.\nMelt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.\nCombine 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, oats, raisins, almonds, vinegar, curry powder, sugar, salt, turmeric, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add onions and ground beef; mix well. Spread the beef evenly into the prepared baking dish; top with bay leaves.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and drain excess fat from the beef.\nBeat 1 egg and 1/4 cup milk together in a bowl; pour over the beef mixture.\nContinue baking in oven until the top is beginning to brown, about 30 minute more. Remove and discard bay leaves to serve.",
