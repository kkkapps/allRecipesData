    "des": "\"A slice of toast with a schmear of Burrata is already a beautiful thing, but when you add a nice pinch of Herbes de Provence salt, then a slice of peach brulee, you are talking about a whole new level of beautiful. This is perfect for any kind of entertaining that occurs while fresh peaches are still in season.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together herbes de Provence and sea salt in a small bowl. Set aside.\nTop each slice toasted bread with a generous spread of Burrata cheese. Sprinkle cheese with a pinch of the herbes de Provence sea salt mixture. Set aside.\nLay peach slices flat in a single layer on a flame-proof surface or plate. Lightly sprinkle each slice with turbinado sugar. Using a kitchen torch set to a medium-low flame, melt the sugar by making short, even passes over the top of the sugar. Continue melting the sugar until it bubbles and turns dark brown, about 30 seconds. Place peach slice on each piece of toast and serve.",
