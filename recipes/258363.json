    "des": "\"This delicious applesauce combines the best of both sweet apples and tangy rhubarb. If you don't have the rhubarb, you can substitute frozen cranberries instead. It is great for freezing, canning, or just eating as soon as it is prepared, warm or cold. Everyone who tries it loves it. It makes great gifts in decorative canning jars!\"",
    "ins": "Combine apples, strawberries, rhubarb, sugar, and water in a large pot. Bring to a boil; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.",
