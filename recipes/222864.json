    "des": "\"This is a family favorite sugar cookie recipe handed down to me from my mom. When my husband was deployed to Iraq, he was always excited to receive a box of these in the mail. I always make sure to watch these closely and take them out of the oven before they brown. If they brown, they will end up too hard and crunchy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nBeat 2 cups sugar, butter, and vegetable oil with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add egg yolks one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Sift flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt into the egg yolk mixture; stir. Stir in vanilla extract. Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls.\nSpread 1/4 cup sugar onto a flat surface. Roll the balls of dough in sugar to coat. Arrange onto baking sheets spaced at least 2 inches apart.\nBake in preheated oven cooked in the middle, but not yet browned, about 15 minutes.",
