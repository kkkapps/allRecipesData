    "des": "\"This is a recipe I created one day when I was in the mood for chicken curry, but also needed to use up some capsicums. I love this dry curry and it is a huge hit with my friends too. It is very spicy and tastes great with parathas.\"",
    "ins": "Evenly season the chicken with salt and turmeric; set aside for 15 minutes.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet or kadhai over medium heat. Cook the onions in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and cook until browned, about 5 minutes more. Stir the bell peppers and chile peppers into the chicken; continue cooking another 5 minutes.\nGrind the cumin seed, coriander seed, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom pod, and fennel seed into a coarse powder; sprinkle over the mixture in the skillet. Add the water, coconut milk powder, ground red pepper, and salt. Cook until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. If the curry is too wet, cook on high until the moisture evaporates. Garnish with cilantro and serve hot.",
