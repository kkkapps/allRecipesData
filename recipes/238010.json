    "ins": "Beat water, olive oil, yeast, sugar, and salt together with an electric mixer until evenly combined, about 2 minutes. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon after each addition, until dough almost comes away from the sides of the bowl.\nKnead the dough with your hands until soft and smooth. Lightly oil a bowl and place dough in the bowl, flipping to coat all of the dough. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",
