    "des": "\"Very different from the other scones I've had, but just as good, or better! Add variety  by putting in raisins, currants, chocolate chips or dried cranberries. These are also good if split open and filled with jam or butter.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons sugar and salt. Using a pastry blender or fork, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles fine bread crumbs. Stir in eggs and cream to make a firm dough. Turn mixture onto a lightly floured surface and briefly knead until dough sticks together.\nDivide the dough into 8 or 10 pieces, and round out the edges. Place onto the prepared cookie sheet, brush with egg white and sprinkle with  remaining sugar.\nBake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.",
