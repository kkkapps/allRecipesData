    "ins": "Place green beans in a steamer basket over 1 inch of boiling water and cover. Cook until the beans are tender but still firm, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain, and keep warm.\nMeanwhile, stir together olive oil and 1 tablespoon orange zest strips in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the olive oil has been infused with the flavor of the orange zest, about 2 minutes. Discard zest strips.\nToss drained green beans with flavored olive oil and kosher salt over medium heat until the beans are hot and coated with oil. Place onto a serving dish and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon grated orange zest to garnish.",
