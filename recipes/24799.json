    "des": "\"Chicken strips dipped in a mayonnaise/mustard mixture, then a sesame seed/cracker crumb mixture and baked. Served with a honey mayonnaise dipping sauce. These chicken strips are very tasty, especially when dipped in the sweet sauce. These go over well at summer get-togethers and make great finger foods.\"",
