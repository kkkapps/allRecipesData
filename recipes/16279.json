    "des": "\"The sauce can be used with any frank or wiener. Using cocktail wieners would be more elegant than cut-up franks. You will need toothpicks for this recipe. The flavor improves upon reheating.\"",
    "ins": "Cut each frank into five bite-sized pieces, unless you're using cocktail wieners.\nIn a large saucepan, combine peanut butter, chutney, chicken stock, corn syrup,  Heat and stir constantly until very smooth. Add franks and continue stirring carefully until franks are covered with sauce. Reduce heat and continue to heat slowly until franks are hot. Insert toothpicks into frankfurters and serve.",
