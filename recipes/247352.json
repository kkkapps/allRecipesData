    "ins": "Slice salmon fillets into 4 equal sections, width-wise. Rotate each section 90 degrees and slice lengthwise, about 1/4-inch thick. Remove pin bones with needle-nose pliers. Don't slice bony sections near the center of the fillet.\nStir soy sauce, molasses, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, black pepper, liquid smoke, and hot sauce together in a glass or plastic bowl until marinade is well-mixed. Place salmon in the marinade, ensuring every strip is covered. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 4 hours.\nRemove salmon from bowl and drain liquid using a colander. Pat the salmon dry using paper towels.\nPlace each salmon strip in a dehydrator and run the dehydrator according to manufacturer's instructions until desired doneness is reached, about 6 hours. Check every few hours for doneness.",
