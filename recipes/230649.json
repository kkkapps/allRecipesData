    "des": "\"As a poor starving college student, this recipe is one of my favorites. It is quick, cheap, and 1-portion size. I actually make about 6 servings of the dry ingredients ahead of time, then add the liquid later. The dry is about 11 tablespoons. A whipping cream or ice cream topping completes this heavenly dessert. Can substitute peanut butter for hazelnut spread, but cut the portion to 1 1/2 tablespoon. You can increase cocoa powder and hazelnut spread to 3 tablespoons each and substitute almond extract for vanilla if desired.\"",
