    "des": "\"If you've never tried rhubarb before, this is the recipe for you. The sweet, crisp topping taking the edge off the tart, tangy fruit, both benefiting from a creamy scoop of vanilla ice cream. This is a great, old-fashioned American dessert. You can substitute all-purpose flour for the whole wheat flour.\"",

Grease a 2-quart baking dish.\nCombine rhubarb, strawberries, white sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a bowl.\nStir brown sugar, whole wheat flour, oats, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl.
