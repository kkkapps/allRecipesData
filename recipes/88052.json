    "ins": "Make a slit down the middle of one end of each hot dog; this will be the legs. At the other end, make a small slit each side; these will be the arms. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil, and add the hot dogs. Boil for about 5 minutes until the slits open up.\nPlace slices of cheese onto slices of bread. Set the hot dog men on top. Use ketchup and mustard to make a face, hair and clothes or buttons.",
