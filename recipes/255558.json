Transfer to the bowl with the olive oil mixture; mix until coated.\nArrange half of the dough balls around the bottom of the tube pan. Scatter pepperoni and mozzarella on top. Top with remaining dough balls. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and oregano on top. Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 15 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Invert onto a serving plate.",
