    "des": "\"This cranberry sauce has extra spices, diced fruits, and orange juice added to make it more exciting than plain old cranberries.  Everyone always loves this at Thanksgiving and it disappears fast! It's best when made the night before and left to rest in the refrigerator overnight so all the flavors can blend together.\"",
    "ins": "Place the cinnamon sticks, allspice berries, and cloves onto the center of a 8 inch square piece of cheesecloth. Gather together the edges of the cheesecloth, and tie with kitchen twine to secure. Place the sachet into a large saucepan along with the cranberries and orange juice. Bring to a boil over high heat, and cook until the berries begin to burst, about 10 minutes.\nStir in the apples, pears, white sugar, and brown sugar. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer about 25 minutes until the apples and pears are slightly soft. Remove and discard the spice sachet. Scrape the sauce into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Serve cold.",
