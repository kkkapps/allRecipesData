    "des": "\"I like this roasted nut recipe because it doesn't use any added oil or butter - my husband likes this because it's nice and spicy!  These have become a Thanksgiving tradition at our house, and make a tasty (albeit unusual)  addition to salads, especially with the Maple Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Spray a large heavy roasting pan with cooking spray.\nMix black pepper, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and dried thyme in a small bowl.  Set aside.\nWhisk egg whites in a large bowl until foamy.  Add Worcestershire, hot sauce, and liquid smoke flavoring and whisk to mix.  Drop in pecans and stir to coat well.  Pour coated pecans into a colander to drain off extra egg white mixture; return to bowl and add the pepper mixture.  Stir well to coat each pecan with spices.\nSpread pecans in prepared roasting pan.  Roast in preheated oven for 5 minutes and stir pecans; roast an additional 5 minutes and stir again.  Turn off heat and roast pecans an additional 5 to 10 minutes until pecans are lightly browned and fragrant.  Let cool and serve at room temperature.",
