    "des": "\"An authentic Italian recipe and a welcome change to the predominantly acidic tomato sauce served in the States.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet, warm olive oil over low heat; saute onion, garlic and celery until onion is transparent.\nStir in butter and increase heat to medium; brown beef until no longer pink. Mix in sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, mint and mushrooms; lower heat and stir for about 3 minutes.\nIn a large bowl, combine tomato paste and broth; pour liquid and basil to pot. Simmer over very low heat for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally.\nBring a large pot of water to a vigorous boil with 3 tablespoons salt and 1 teaspoon olive oil.  Slip spaghetti into water holding on to ends until strands soften a bit.  Cook over high heat for 7 to 8 minutes only.  When properly cooked, raw taste should be gone but still have a firm texture.\nWhen ready to serve, combine pasta with meat sauce; serve on a warmed platter or bowl topped with parsley and Romano cheese.",
