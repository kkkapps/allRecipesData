    "ins": "Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until it begins to foam.\nCook and stir the celery, onion, and red bell pepper in the hot butter until soft, about 10 minutes.\nStir the half-and-half and parsley through the vegetable mixture; season with salt and black pepper.\nContinue cooking until the mixture just begins to boil; add the oysters and any liquid from the can to the stew along with Louisiana-style hot sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the oysters begin to curl, 10 to 15 minutes more.\nRemove the saucepan from heat and allow the stew to sit 5 minutes before serving.",
