Press 1/2 the graham cracker crumb mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nBeat condensed milk, cream cheese, egg, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.

Spread remaining 1/2 graham cracker mixture on top of cream cheese mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until set, 25 to 30 minutes. Chill completely before cutting.",
