    "des": "\"Every time my family and I go to a Chinese buffet we make a bee line for the green beans!  This is a simple and tasty re-creation of that much loved side dish, goes well with any Asian meal.  Make sure to slice the garlic, don't use a garlic press.  Oyster sauce can be found in the Asian section of your grocery store, at an Asian grocery store, and online.\"",
    "ins": "Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until the edges begin to brown, about 20 seconds. Add the green beans; cook and stir until the green beans begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sugar, oyster sauce, and soy sauce. Continue cooking and stirring for several minutes until the beans have attained the desired degree of tenderness.",
