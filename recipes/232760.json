    "des": "\"This meatloaf has a lot of flavor and is very satisfying if you are craving protein. My husband and I, both vegetarians, made this for my brother, a hunter and meat-enthusiast, and he really liked it. The best thing about this meatloaf is the next day when I can have a cold meatloaf sandwich with mayonnaise.\"",
