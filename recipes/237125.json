    "ins": "Pour 1 1/2 cups orange juice into a resealable plastic bag. Add tilapia fillets, coat with the juice, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 3 hours to overnight.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nWhisk butter, panko bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons orange juice, garlic, and basil together in a bowl.\nRemove tilapia from the orange juice and shake to remove excess liquid; arrange fillets in a 13x9-inch baking dish. Discard marinade.\nPour 1/2 cup orange juice over the tilapia fillets. Spread butter mixture over the top of the filets to cover each completely.\nBake in preheated oven until the liquid is bubbling and the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.",
