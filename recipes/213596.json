    "des": "\"I had the most amazing sugar pie in Quebec City, Canada at a restaurant called the Cochon Dingue. (The Crazy Pig).  Their version is custardy versus the soft-fudgy/brown sugar ones that are a regional specialty.  The pie tastes better if made 1 night (or more) before serving. Good luck on having it around for that long! Serve topped with creme fraiche, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the pie crust in its plate in a large, shallow baking pan lined with foil in case of a boil-over.\nBring maple syrup to a boil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, to reduce syrup down by about one-quarter. Stir in cream, bring the mixture to a simmer, then remove from heat.\nWhisk egg yolks and egg together in a large bowl. Very gradually add the cream mixture to the eggs, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking constantly. Stir in salt, vanilla extract, and vinegar. Pour the batter into the prepared pie crust.\nBake until the pie is mostly set but jiggles slightly when moved, about 1 hour. Let cool before serving.",
