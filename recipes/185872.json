    "des": "\"This is an eggless and dairy-free recipe I was working out this morning. It's different, but good! It's a bit like cornmeal cakes, yet also reminiscent of crepes. Serve with maple syrup, crushed fruit, or just a sprinkle of sugar and lemon juice!\"",
    "ins": "Sift together the Kamut(R) flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the mayonnaise, coconut milk, water, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture; stir to combine, but do not over-stir. The batter should be lumpy.\nPreheat a griddle or place a large skillet over medium heat; lightly grease the cooking surface.\nMeasure batter onto the heated cooking surface in about 1/4 cup portions, leaving 1 to 2 inches between each pancake. Allow to cook until bubbles form on the top of the cake; flip and cook 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.",
