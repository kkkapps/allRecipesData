    "des": "\"I love finding ways to add a little oomph in nutrition to my kiddos favorite treats. We have become big users of chia. Heck, just to keep everyone's insides working well, we add a tidbit of psyllium husk. Can top with anything. We love strawberries and maple syrup, bananas with nutella, or just plain ol' boysenberry syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Mix flour, cottage cheese, orange juice, eggs, chia seeds, olive oil, psyllium husk, and water together in a bowl until batter is smooth.\nHeat butter in a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
