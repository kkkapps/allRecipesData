    "des": "\"This tortilla soup tastes better than anything you can get at a restaurant. And it's healthy too! Don't let the long list of ingredients fool you. All you do is dump everything into the slow cooker and walk away. Garnish with grated Cheddar, avocadoes, and a splash of fresh lime juice.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken, tomatoes, enchilada sauce, onion, green chiles, and garlic into a slow cooker. Pour in water and chicken broth, and season with cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Stir in corn and cilantro. Cover, and cook on Low setting for 6 to 8 hours or on High setting for 3 to 4 hours.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nLightly brush both sides of tortillas with oil. Cut tortillas into strips, then spread on a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes. To serve, sprinkle tortilla strips over soup.",
