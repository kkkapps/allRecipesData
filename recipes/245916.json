    "des": "\"Nothing exotic here except perfect brown rice every time. I was surprised that there was no recipe for this already. I hated making brown rice on the stove top, so I have used this for almost 20 years. Smells like popcorn when it is baking. Be creative! Add spices to match any meal. Make a double recipe and you have the beginnings for a breakfast frittata or stir fried rice.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9 baking dish.\nPlace rice in prepared baking dish; sprinkle salt and oil on top. Pour boiling water over rice. Cover baking dish tightly with double layer of aluminum foil and pinch edges to seal.\nBake in center of preheated oven until water is absorbed, about 1 hour.\nRemove rice from oven, uncover, and fluff with fork.",
