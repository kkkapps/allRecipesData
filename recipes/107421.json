    "des": "\"Delicious over couscous or orzo. I use a seasoned Dutch oven, but any roaster will do. Given to me with permission by family friend.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nCoarsely grind caraway seeds with salt  with a mortar and pestle.  Mash the garlic into a paste with the caraway.  In a large bowl, whisk together the garlic paste with the honey, lemon juice, and olive oil.  Season with paprika, cumin, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper; mix well.\nLightly oil the inside of a heavy, ovenproof Dutch oven.  Add the zucchini, turnips, red pepper, yellow squash, and onions.  Toss with 1/2 of the spice paste.  Stir in tomatoes and chicken broth.  Toss the Cornish hens with the remaining spice paste, then arrange them in the Dutch oven, so that the cut side is facing down.\nCover the Dutch oven, and bake in the center of the preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  If a crunchy skin is desired on the Cornish hens, uncover during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Skim the fat off of the broth.\nServe hens on top of vegetables, spoon some of the broth over, and sprinkle with the parsley, cilantro, and mint.",
