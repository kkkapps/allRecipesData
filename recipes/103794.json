    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nPlace each piece of salmon on a large (12 inch)  circle of parchment paper so that they are 1 inch from the center.  Cover each with a spoonful of peas, a clove of crushed garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. Fold the paper over into a packet and seal the edges by crimping and folding like a pasty. Place on a baking sheet.\nBake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is able to flake with a fork. To serve, place the packets onto serving plates and cut open the center in the shape of a cross.",
