    "des": "\"This is an easy, hearty meal for a family or dinner party--burritos also freeze well! Great served with salsa and sour cream! Habanero chile peppers are extremely hot! You might only need half of one to generate enough heat for your tastes! Be careful when you chop the habanero chile, remember to use gloves!\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan (wok pans also work well) heat oil over medium-high and saute yellow onion, green onions, garlic, habanero, and bell pepper until onions become translucent. Add seitan and saute another 5 minutes. Add black beans and tomatoes. Heat through.\nIn a medium size mixing bowl combine heated mixture with cooked rice, cilantro, and 1 cup barbecue sauce.\nLay tortillas on flat surface. Spoon about 3/4 cup of filling onto each tortilla's center. Wrap tortilla so that mixture is captured on the inside.\nIn a casserole dish pour barbecue sauce to coat the dish's bottom. Place burritos in dish and pour more barbecue sauce on top of them. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven  for 35 minutes.",
