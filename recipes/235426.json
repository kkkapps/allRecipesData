    "des": "\"I love fresh shrimp and I love butternut squash. I cook the squash in the morning or even the day before.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace butternut, cut-side up, on a baking sheet. Brush cut sides with about 1 tablespoon olive oil; season with salt and pepper.\nBake in the preheated oven until flesh is tender when punctured with a fork, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let squash cool on baking sheet; remove peel and slice into 1/2-inch thick by 2-inch long pieces.\nWhisk vinegar, mustard, basil, garlic, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle oil into vinegar mixture while constantly whisking until dressing is silky and emulsified.\nBring a pot of salted water to a boil; cook shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain shrimp and sprinkle with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.\nDivide lettuce between 2 serving plates; top with butternut squash, tomatoes, and onion. Generously brush dressing onto squash and tomatoes. Arrange shrimp evenly on both plates.",
