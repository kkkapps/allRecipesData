    "ins": "Pour apple cider mix into a 1/2 cup measuring cup. Top off with enough sugar to equal 1/2 cup.\nCombine sugar mixture, flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl.\nMix milk, egg, and orange zest together in a small bowl. Pour over flour mixture; mix gently until dough comes together in a ball.\nTurn dough out onto a floured work surface; pat into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into doughnuts using a floured doughnut cutter.\nFill a large saucepan with oil to a depth 1 1/2 inch; heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a few doughnuts carefully into the hot oil. Fry until deep golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining doughnuts.",
