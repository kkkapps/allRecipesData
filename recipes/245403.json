Whisk egg yolks into molasses mixture.\nCook molasses mixture, whisking constantly, over medium heat until large bubbles appear on surface, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute more. Remove saucepan from heat and pour filling through sieve. Whisk butter into filling until smooth.\nPour filling into pie crust, place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on surface of filling, and refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.\nLightly beat cream in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Top each pie slice with a heaping tablespoon of whipped cream.",
