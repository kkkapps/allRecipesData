Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes until sauce thickens.\nFor cinnamon rolls, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray an 8-inch cake pan with non-stick cooking spray. Roll out pizza dough into 8 x 12-inch rectangle with the smallest length facing you.\nCombine sugars and cinnamon together in small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over dough. Pat sugar mixture gently into dough. Roll dough away from you. Dough will be about 2 inches in diameter and 12 inches long.\nCut dough into 8 equally thick slices. Place rolls in prepared cake pan and Bake for 20 minutes.\nPour sauce over rolls, and, bake for an additional 15 minutes. Let pan cool slightly on wire rack for 10 minutes. Serve.",
