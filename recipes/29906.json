    "des": "\"This is different from your normal sweet potato pies, especially the crust and the cream cheese. My grandmother used to make it, then my mother and her sisters made it for many years. Now that I've moved away from New York and are no longer with them, I make it for my girlfriend's family. Eat it with Thanksgiving dinner, just like we did! Enjoy!\"",
