    "des": "\"This is my grandmother's recipe - 'Bunch' is short for 'Honeybunch,' our pet name for her.  It is always a huge hit and it can be constructed the night before if need be. Just allow a little extra cooking time since the dish will be cold from refrigeration.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.\nPreheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7 inch baking dish.\nIn a bowl, combine the chopped eggs, heavy cream, mayonnaise, onion, parsley, and sherry. Reserve 1/2 cup of the stuffing mix and add the rest to the egg mixture. Stir in the crabmeat.\nPour the mixture into prepared baking dish and sprinkle the reserved stuffing on top. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until bubbly and slightly browned on top.",
