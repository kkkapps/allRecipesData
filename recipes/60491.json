    "des": "\"This delicious cold roasted asparagus recipe is great if you love asparagus, and even if you don't. The tangy dressing and the roasted taste of the asparagus and peppers brings it all together. You can make this a day ahead of serving. You may not need to use all of the dressing. Also, you can make the vegetables the night before and add the dressing a few hours before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange the asparagus spears and bell peppers in a single layer on the baking sheet, and drizzle or mist with 1/4 cup of olive oil.\nRoast 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tender, turning occasionally to prevent burning. Remove from heat, and cool completely.\nIn a bowl, toss together the asparagus, bell peppers, onion, almond slices, and Parmesan cheese.\nIn a separate bowl, mix the 1/2 cup olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, lime juice, sugar, hot sauce, and salad seasoning. Pour over the salad, and toss to coat.",
