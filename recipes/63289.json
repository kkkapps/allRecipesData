    "des": "\"I learned about butterfish in Saratoga, California at the Race Street Market where I first tried it. I wouldn't eat fish as a child and am very particular which fish and shellfish I'll eat.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.\nIn a bowl, cream together the butter, chopped parsley, and chives.\nArrange the butterfish in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Dot the fish with about 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture.\nBake 5 minutes in the preheated oven, until the butter is melted. Turn fillets, brush with remaining butter mixture, and continue baking 10 minutes, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Garnish with parsley sprigs and lemon wedges to serve.",
