    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a glass or stoneware 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nMix sirloin, turkey, oats, onion, eggs, egg whites, 3 tablespoons chili sauce, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; shape into a 9x5-inch loaf and put into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Spoon remaining chili sauce over the top of the meatloaf and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Rest meatloaf for 10 minutes before slicing.",
