    "ins": "Mix the box of cake mix, eggs, pie filling and applesauce  till moist. Use a microwave safe bundt pan or substitute a microwave safe bowl that has a microwave safe cup or cone placed in the middle of it (to mimic a bundt pan).  Pour mixture into the bowl around the cup.\nBake on high for 6 minutes 30 seconds,  turn and bake for another 6 minutes 30 seconds on high. Remove from oven and cover bowl with a dish and let stand for 5 minutes (this finishes the cooking process).\nTurn cake over onto dish and remove cone (cup) for a delicious quick dessert. Good hot with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.",
