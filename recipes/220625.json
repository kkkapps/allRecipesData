    "ins": "Cook and stir the bacon and onion in a saucepan over medium-high heat until the onion is translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.\nStir the garlic and yellow bell pepper into the bacon mixture; cook and stir together another 2 minutes.\nMix the diced potato, asparagus, crabmeat, skim milk, half-and-half, salt, and black pepper into the bacon mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.",
