    "des": "\"This one's so quick and easy, and its understated class makes it a fantastic entree at a dinner party. It's done the rounds between all my friends, and we love it as a quick and gorgeous dinner! This pasta tastes divine, it's quick, simple, looks beautiful, and if that's not enough, it's also incredibly budget-and waistline-friendly! Goes well visually and palatably with a fresh green salad.\"",
