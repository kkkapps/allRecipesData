    "des": "\"Because it's boiled, this teriyaki turns into a great caramelized sauce that can be drizzled across the chicken and steamed white rice for a nice side dish. This can be made with any kind of meat - drumettes make a great party item. Recipe doubles nicely.\"",
    "ins": "Combine sugar, soy sauce, and water in an 8-quart pot; stir until sugar is dissolved. Turn heat to medium-high; add ginger, garlic, cinnamon, and black pepper and stir.\nBring mixture to a boil and add chicken drumettes. Once mixture begins to boil again, reduce heat to medium-low, and partially cover pot with a lid tilted to allow steam to escape. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and teriyaki sauce is thickened, at least 1 hour.",
