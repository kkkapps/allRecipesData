Rinse shrimp and dry thoroughly.\nCombine salt, pepper, and 5-spice powder in a small bowl.\nHeat oil in wok or a heavy pot over high heat until your deep fry thermometer reaches 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCook shrimp, about 5 per batch, in the hot oil until shrimp are bright pink and cooked through, about 1 minute. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Return oil temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) before each new batch.\nDiscard the oil in the wok and heat wok over medium-high heat; add deep-fried shrimp and spice mix and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
