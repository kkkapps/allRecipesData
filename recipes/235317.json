    "des": "\"This recipe is from my mom, and the best bearnaise I ever tasted. Although it is a fattening treat, it is worth every calorie! Best served over a good steak and really good on asparagus too! Or can be used instead of hollandaise on eggs Benedict. To keep warm, keep it in double boiler over hot water (removed from heat) until ready to serve.\"",
    "ins": "Combine white wine, vinegar, shallot, tarragon, and black pepper together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce  heat and simmer until mixture is reduced to about 1/4 cup, 5 to 10 minutes.\nWhisk egg yolks, hot water, salt, and hot sauce together in a bowl until very well mixed, about 2 minutes.\nPour white wine mixture into the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Whisk egg yolk mixture into wine mixture until well mixed. Pour butter into mixture and whisk until sauce is smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes.",
