Stir in the egg and enough hot water to moisten.\nArrange turkey legs on the foil sheet, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the bread mixture around the legs, and dot with butter. Tightly seal the foil around the legs and bread mixture.\nBake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the turkey leg meat has reached an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).",
