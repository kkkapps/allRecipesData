Tasty bite-size pillows filled with Spam\u00c2\u00ae and pineapple are served with sweet chili sauce for dipping. These are super easy to prepare, but do take a bit of time to fill and shape the pillows.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nMix grated luncheon meat, pineapple, bread crumbs, milk, egg, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and white pepper together in a bowl. Spoon about 1 teaspoon meat-pineapple mixture onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Brush the edges of wrapper with water and fold in half diagonally over filling, sealing the edges together. Arrange wontons on the prepared baking sheet; brush each with olive oil.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.",
