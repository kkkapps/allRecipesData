    "des": "\"This recipe makes very moist chicken thighs breaded with cracker crumbs and coated in apricot preserves.  I make this at least once every two weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.\nWhisk together the orange juice, mustard, and salt in a small bowl. Mix together the cracker crumbs, orange zest, and black pepper on a plate. Coat each chicken thigh in the orange juice mixture and then press into the cracker crumb mixture to cover both sides completely. Place the breaded thighs on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven 15 minutes; flip and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nSwitch the oven setting to 'Broil.'\nTop each thigh with 1 tablespoon of the apricot preserves and place beneath the oven's broiler until the preserves begin to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. When the chicken looks like it is starting to burn it is done.",
