    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press one of  the pie crusts into and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate.\nBring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender, 10 to15 minutes. Drain, and cut into cubes. Set aside.\nHeat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over low heat. Add onion and shiitake mushrooms, cover, and let the mushrooms sweat for about 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the water and tamari, and bring to a boil. Whisk in rice flour, stirring until there are no lumps. Allow to simmer.\nHeat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add portobello pieces, and saute briefly until mushrooms are browned on the outside. Add mushrooms to the gravy mixture along with the carrots, celery and potatoes. Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with thyme and sage. Pour the mixture into the prepared crust. Cover with the other pie crust, and crimp edges to seal. Make a few slits in the top crust to vent steam.\nBake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is golden brown.",
