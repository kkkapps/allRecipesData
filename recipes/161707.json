    "des": "\"This is a shredded, slow-cooker version of my favorite chicken mole, created when I knew I wouldn't have time in the evening to make the real thing for dinner.  If you can't find ancho chili powder, you can substitute regular, but use a little more; and use your favorite type of hot sauce. I love Golden Habanero, but any kind tastes good!\"",
    "ins": "Place the onion, raisins, currants, garlic, chile powder, sesame seeds, cumin, cinnamon, cocoa powder, hot sauce, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and chicken broth into a slow cooker; stir to mix. Add the chicken breasts, and stir to cover with sauce.\nCover and cook on Low 6 hours, then increase heat to High, and continue cooking until the chicken is tender, about 3 hours more. Or cook on Low for 11 to 12 hours.\nOnce the chicken is tender, remove, shred, and stir it back into the mole. Serve sprinkled with slivered almonds.",
