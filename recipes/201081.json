    "ins": "Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the chicken in the hot oil until lightly browned on all sides.\nWhisk the tomato sauce, garlic, onion, bay leaves, cumin, oregano, and vinegar in a bowl; pour over the chicken. Bring the mixture to a simmer and continue cooking until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
