    "ins": "Whisk yogurt, garlic, ginger, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Place chicken strips into yogurt mixture and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 3 hours.\nRemove chicken strips from yogurt mixture and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Shake strips to remove excess yogurt and discard marinade.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nStir oats and bread crumbs together in a bowl. Press chicken strips into bread crumb mixture; gently toss between your hands so any crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded chicken strips the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn strips over and bake until no longer pink in the center and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes.",
