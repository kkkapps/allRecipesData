    "des": "\"This is my grandmother's recipe we've had for generations, with some modifications since most of you won't have pans like my grandma's.  If you like, substitute your favorite sweet shortbread pastry for the plain pastry crust.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 18 muffin cups.\nRoll out pastry and cut out 18 circles with a 3-inch round cutter. Fit one pastry circle into each muffin cup. Set aside.\nPlace raisins in a large saucepan. Add enough water to barely cover raisins. Boil on stovetop until water is absorbed and raisins are soft. Cool partially, then stir in butter or margarine, sugar, nuts, and vanilla.\nAfter butter or margarine is melted and all ingredients are blended, stir in eggs. Mix well. Spoon mixture into pastry-lined muffin cups, filling each one 2/3 full.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until set in center and golden brown on top.",
