    "des": "\"This is a Polish comfort food with an Italian flare. Haluski (cabbage and noodles) is a popular budget-friendly Polish dish. I had some cabbage in the fridge and some gnocchi in my pantry so I decided to stir up some fun. I loved the way it turned out. Sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, it is even more savory and delish.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes.\nMelt 2 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until cabbage is translucent but still crunchy, 5 to 7 minutes.\nToss cooked gnocchi into the cabbage until combined. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.",
