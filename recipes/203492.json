    "ins": "Fill a saucepan with water, bring it to a boil, and boil the ears of corn until partially cooked, about 3 minutes. Plunge the ears of corn into ice water to chill, then cut the kernels off the cobs into a bowl.\nMelt the butter in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until translucent and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the corn; cook and stir until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and yellow squash slices, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the squash are tender and the liquid from the vegetables is cooked away, about 8 minutes.\nRemove the lid, season the vegetables with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Place the lid back on the skillet, and turn off the heat. Allow the cheese to melt, and serve hot.",
