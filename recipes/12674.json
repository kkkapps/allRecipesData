    "des": "\"I used to wonder why I disliked cheesecake and key lime pie, since I like cream cheese pastry and lemon pie. Then I tried a key lime pie in a shortbread crust and realized it was the graham cracker crust I disliked. Both these desserts need a darker than usual crust, however.\"",
    "ins": "Cream the cheese and butter together with the sugar. Work in the flour a tablespoon at a time until the dough has the grainy consistency of a graham cracker crust. (May take a little more or a little less than 1 cup of flour.)\nRoll up into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and put in refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes to develop some body. Put in pie plate and pat down to cover bottom and sides.\nIf your pie filling is pre-cooked, you will want to bake the crust.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until edges start to darken.",
