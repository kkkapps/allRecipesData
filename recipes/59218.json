    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe when I was craving fried rice and needed something lower in fat.  The cabbage blends in with the rice so that even your kids won't know they are eating a vegetable. My husband likes to eat this for a late dinner because it's so light. Be creative or use whatever is in your fridge. Like it Spicy? Add some chili sauce. This dish goes great with baked spring rolls!\"",
    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in rice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic and rice in oil for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning the garlic. Add broccoli and cauliflower florets and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes. Toss green onions, carrots, cabbage, and water chestnuts into the pan, and cook another 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. Add additional water as needed to keep vegetables moist. Drizzle with soy sauce, and toss to coat.",
