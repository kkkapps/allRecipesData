Stir reduced wine, carrot, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, parsley, vinegar, pepper, and salt into garlic; cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.\nMix mussels and vegetable-wine mixture together in a bowl; marinate in refrigerator, about 24 hours. Serve by scooping a mussel and marinade into reserved half shells arranged on a platter.",
