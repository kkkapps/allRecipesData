Chop onion, Parmesan cheese, and garlic in the food processor; add to the spinach. Mix in cooled quinoa, bread crumbs, salt, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and black pepper. Add egg whites and egg; stir burger mixture to combine.\nShape burger mixture into 4 equal patties. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Cook patties until cooked throughout, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Serve on hamburger buns.",
