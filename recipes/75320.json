    "des": "\"This chutney closely resembles imported Indian chutneys and is good with all curry dishes.  It is also great with cream cheese and crackers.\"",
    "ins": "In a large heavy pot, stir together the peaches, raisins, garlic, onion, preserved ginger, chili powder, mustard seed, curry powder, brown sugar and cider vinegar. Wrap the pickling spice in a cheesecloth bag, and place in the pot.\nBring to a boil, and cook over medium heat uncovered until the mixture reaches your desired consistency. It will take about 1 1/2 hours to get a good thick sauce. Stir frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom.\nRemove the spice bag, and ladle into hot sterilized jars. Wipe the rims with a clean moist cloth. Seal with lids and rings, and process in a barely simmering  water bath for 10 minutes, or the time recommended by your local extension for your area. The water should cover the jars completely.",
