Add garlic, onion, and green pepper and saute until onions are soft.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large mixing bowl, place ground beef, crushed crackers, Cheddar cheese, taco seasoning, and sauteed onion and green pepper. Mix thoroughly.\nPress beef mixture into a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Bake in a preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes or until done. Check with a meat thermometer for doneness.
