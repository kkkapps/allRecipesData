    "des": "\"This is a very quick and easy soup.  Quinoa is a grain found in most health food stores, and many large grocery stores.  It is a complete protein containing all 8 amino acids, so serve this soup with a whole-wheat roll for a filling and nutritious lunch.\"",
    "ins": "Bring the beef broth, water, and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the green onions, mushrooms, green beans, and tarragon; continue cooking until the green beans are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the evaporated milk, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer 2 more minutes until heated through.",
