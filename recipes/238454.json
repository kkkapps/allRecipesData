Brush the cut sides with some of the garlic-flavored butter.\nSplit the rolls and line the insides with mozzarella cheese slices. Mix spaghetti and spaghetti sauce together in a bowl; divide between the hoagie rolls and sandwich the rolls around the cheese and pasta mixture.\nGrill the sandwiches in the skillet until the cheese melts completely, about 5 minutes per side.",
