    "ins": "Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mustard seeds in hot oil until popping and toasted, 10 to 15 seconds.\nStir cauliflower, potato, salt, and turmeric into oil until coated completely; cover the skillet with a lid, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring every few minutes, until cauliflower and potato are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with sugar and cayenne pepper and cook until flavors develop, about 2 minutes more.",
