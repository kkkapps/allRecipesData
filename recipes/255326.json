Add cauliflower; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). (If using a countertop convection oven, preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)). Place baking sheet inside to warm.\nRemove paper towel from tofu; discard.

Add onions and scallions; cook and stir until onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic. Turn wok to high heat; stir in green peppers.\nCombine water and orange liqueur in a bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon liqueur mixture into wok; toss with 2 wooden spoons until mixed. Repeat with remaining liqueur mixture; cook and stir until evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.\nSprinkle soy sauce into the wok. Fold in tofu until coated.\nPlace cauliflower in serving bowls and top with tofu mixture. Garnish with red chile peppers; season with salt.",
