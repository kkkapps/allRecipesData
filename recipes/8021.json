    "des": "\"The traditional recipe for petits fours uses genoise for the cake base, but pound cake can also be used. Use this frosting to decorate on the base of your choice.\"",
    "ins": "Combine sugar, cream of tartar, salt, and water in a small saucepan.  Cook to the soft ball stage, 234 - 240 degrees F (112 - 115 degrees C).  Cool to lukewarm.\nGradually beat in enough confectioners' sugar to make mixture thick enough to almost hold its shape.  Stir in flavoring.  Divide into 4 parts.  Leave one part white and tint other portions pink, yellow, and green.\nTo ice petits fours, place them on a cooling rack and spoon the icing/frosting over the top until covered.",
