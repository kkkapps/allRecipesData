Pour in the broth.\nCover and cook on LOW for 8 to 9 hours* or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken to a cutting board.  Using 2 forks, shred the chicken.\nReserve 1 cup liquid in cooker, adding additional broth, if needed, to make 1 cup.  Stir the soup into the cooker.  Stir in chicken.\nHeat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Layer half the chicken mixture, tortillas and cheese in a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Repeat the layers.\nBake for 30 minutes or until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve over the rice.",
