    "ins": "Peel shrimp, reserving the shells.  In a skillet over medium heat, cook the garlic and shrimp in 2 tablespoons of olive oil, stirring frequently to keep the garlic from browning.  When shrimp are cooked through, remove from heat, cool and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.\nBring water to a boil in a Dutch oven over high heat.  Add shrimp shells, boil for 5 minutes, then strain out shells and discard.  Stir in the orzo and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the asparagus pieces and continue cooking until the pasta is al dente, about 4 minutes.  Drain into a mesh sieve, and rinse in cold water.\nToss pasta and asparagus with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, shrimp, and green onions until evenly coated. In a separate bowl, whisk the vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, and basil until incorporated.  Pour over pasta mixture and toss well; season to taste with salt and pepper.  Chill for 2 hours.",
