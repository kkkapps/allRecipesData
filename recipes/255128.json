    "des": "\"This is a very nutritious breakfast that is similar to porridge or breakfast cereal. It is a favorite Egyptian meal for kids as well as adults. This is comfort food for me at any time during the day when my sweet tooth is calling. Yum! Store the cooked wheat berries, undrained, in the fridge. Whenever you need to serve, just heat the amount you desire and add the hot milk to it.\"",
