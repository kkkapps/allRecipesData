    "des": "\"Our family was visiting, and we went to Disney World on New Year's Day. I just had to have black-eyed peas before midnight. Make it easy, soak black-eyed peas in the slow cooker overnight. This is a little thinner, like a very rich soup.  We really enjoyed it; hope you will too! Hot buttered cornbread and chunky applesauce are my favorites to serve with black-eyed peas.\"",
    "ins": "Put black-eyed peas into a large container with enough cool water to cover by a few inches; soak 8 hours to overnight.\nPut ham hocks into a stockpot with 6 cups water; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer until meat is falling off bone, about 90 minutes. Remove ham hocks and reserve for another use. Refrigerate the ham stock, 8 hours to overnight.\nDrain and rinse black-eyed peas thoroughly; transfer to a slow cooker. Bury one of the cooked ham hocks in the peas; add onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and sugar.\nSkim congealed fat from surface of ham stock; discard. Pour stock into slow cooker. Add enough water to cover the peas by 1 1/2 inches.\nCook on Low for 14 hours. Season with salt.",
