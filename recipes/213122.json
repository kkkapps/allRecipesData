    "ins": "Mix together the corned beef, onion, mustard, mayonnaise, and horseradish. Cover and refrigerate.\nPreheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nIn a large pot, bring beer and butter to a rolling boil. Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a lightly greased baking sheet.\nBake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake an additional 10 minutes until golden brown. Centers should be dry.\nWhen the shells are cool, split the puffs and fill with the corned beef mixture. Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
