    "des": "\"Usually, franks and beans is made by opening up a couple cans of baked beans, and heating it up with some sliced hotdogs. Not exactly something you'd serve to visiting dignitaries. However, by adding some fresh veggies, plain beans, and high-quality beef hot dogs, we can achieve something much healthier, equally delicious, and every bit as comforting. Serve with buttered toast and Champagne.\"",
    "ins": "Lightly score hot dog skins from end to end on 4 sides. This helps keep them flat when they cook. Slice into 1/2-inch rounds.\nMelt butter in large pot over medium heat. Add onions, poblano pepper, celery, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft and onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.\nStir in hot dog slices and cook until heated through and fat from hot dogs mixes with the butter, about 3 minutes. Add brown sugar, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce; pour in chicken broth. Stir in beans. Raise heat to bring mixture to a simmer; reduce heat to low and cook until flavors mix, about 30 minutes. While beans are cooking, use a wooden spoon to crush some of them against the side of the pot to help thicken the stew. If mixture gets too thick, add more broth.\nJust before serving, stir in chopped green onions.",
