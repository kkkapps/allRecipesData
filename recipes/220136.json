    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nButter the heart-shaped molds.\nBeat brownie mix, vegetable oil, water, and 1 egg together in a bowl until smooth and well mixed.\nPour the batter into the prepared heart molds.\nBeat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Beat in 1 egg until smooth.\nSpoon a dollop of the cream cheese mixture into each heart mold and mix slightly with a knife to make decorative swirls of cream cheese filling in the brownie batter.\nBake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.\nWhile brownies are baking, place chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30-second intervals, stirring after each time, until the chocolate is warm, smooth, and melted.\nStir heavy cream into the chocolate. Mixture will be clumpy.\nRemove hearts from oven, and immediately spread about 1 tablespoon of chocolate mixture over each heart.\nReturn the hearts to the oven and bake until the chocolate topping spreads out, about 5 minutes. Cool before serving.",
