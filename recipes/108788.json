    "des": "\"These easy cheese potatoes are great over the grill or campfire.  And since they're in a foil packet, there's no mess to clean up!\"",
    "ins": "Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire.\nCut 2 lengths of heavy duty foil approximately 18 inches square, placing one on top of the other for strength.  Spray top one with non-stick spray. Spread potatoes on foil leaving plenty of room to fold up later. Scatter the onion over potatoes; slice the margarine over the potatoes; layer the Parmesan, mozzarella, and Cheddar cheeses over the potatoes; season with salt and pepper. Bring opposite edges of foil together and seal.\nPlace the packet directly onto your campfire and cook until the potatoes are soft, about 35 minutes.",
