    "des": "\"The best persimmon recipe I have ever tried. Handed down in my wife's family from her mother and grandmother. \nIf you have not tried persimmons, this is an excellent place to start.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x16-inch baking pan.\nCombine flour, 2 1/2 cups sugar, persimmon pulp, milk, butter, eggs, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Continue baking until top is browned, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool, about 10 minutes; pudding will sink in the center.\nCombine 1 cup sugar, water, and vanilla extract in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sugar has dissolved into a clear glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour over warm pudding; let stand until set, about 10 minutes.",
