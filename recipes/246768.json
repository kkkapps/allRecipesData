    "des": "\"Basically, I used tofu instead of eggs, and the meat-eaters thought it was beef! Note that I prepare the dish with a wok. A regular frying pan might require longer cooking time. I cook until everything looks done, so I don't always pay attention to the time. Experimenting is half the fun of stir-fry!\"",
    "ins": "Thaw tofu until it comes to room temperature, about 2 hours. Squeeze between paper towels to drain thoroughly and transfer to a bowl. Add Worcestershire sauce, then enough soy sauce to cover. Let marinate, at least 1 hour.\nDrain tofu, discarding marinade.\nHeat a wok or large skillet over high heat until smoking, about 30 seconds. Add oil; heat until shimmering, about 20 seconds. Add green onions and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add tofu; stir-fry until scrambled and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.\nCook yellow onion in the wok until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add frozen vegetables; saute until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in rice, mirin, sesame oil, and enough soy sauce to cover the rice. Season with salt and pepper. Add bean sprouts; cook and stir until rice is hot, 1 to 2 minutes.",
