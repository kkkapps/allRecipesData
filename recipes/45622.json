    "des": "\"I've tried other waffle recipes, and this is one is by far the best! The texture is moist, not dry - and they freeze well. Cool on wire racks before freezing, then just pop them in the toaster to reheat.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat waffle iron. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; set aside.\nIn a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks. Blend in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk.\nIn a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.\nSpray waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray, or lightly brush with oil. Ladle the batter onto preheated waffle iron. Cook the waffles until golden and crisp. Serve immediately.",
