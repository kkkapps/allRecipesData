    "ins": "Whisk together the pancake mix, skim milk, and ricotta in a bowl until smooth. Batter should be thick; add more milk if necessary to get desired consistency.\nHeat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.",
