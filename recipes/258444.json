Add onion; cook, stirring often, until soft and deeply browned in parts, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPour salsa and chicken stock into the Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Layer in 1/2 of the chips, Cheddar cheese, and pulled pork. Repeat with the remaining chips, Cheddar cheese, and pulled pork (see Cook's Note for recipe link).
