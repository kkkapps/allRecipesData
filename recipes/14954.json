    "des": "\"The word 'ragu' means to stimulate the appetite. This sauce certainly fits the bill and hails from Northern Italy. It does not use garlic, has just a touch of tomato paste and a sprinkling of grated nutmeg, too. The sauce may be used on ravioli, gnocchi, spaetzle or any other type of hot, cooked pasta.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan, combine beef, chopped pork, veal, salt pork, onion, carrot and celery to brown thoroughly over medium low heat. Add stock or water and continue to cook until it evaporates.\nAdd tomato paste, salt, pepper and enough water to cover meat. Cover pan and cook slowly for 1 hour. Add mushrooms and livers and cook for 15 minutes longer. Just before serving add cream, truffle and nutmeg. Mix well and serve.",
