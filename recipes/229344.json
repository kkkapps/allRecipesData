Let onions cool for a few minutes.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove tart shells from freezer and place on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.\nCombine caramelized onions with pears, blue cheese, and walnuts in a large bowl. Spoon pear-blue cheese filling into still-frozen tart shells.\nBake in the preheated oven until the filling is hot and melted and the pastry shells are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm or cooled.",
