    "des": "\"This recipe came to be one summer night at a poolside cookout back in southern California. I have been asked for this recipe so many times, I decided to give it to the world. It is tangy, tasty, and even non mushroom eaters have devoured this dish each time I have made it.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix soy sauce, red wine vinegar, ground black pepper and hot pepper sauce. Poke holes in the mushrooms using a fork, then place them in the soy sauce mixture. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.\nPreheat grill for high heat.\nLightly oil the grill grate. Place mushrooms on the grill and cook until browned and tender, about 10 minutes.",
