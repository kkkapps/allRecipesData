    "ins": "Season pork chops with salt and pepper.\nPlace a large skillet over medium-high heat. Lay seasoned pork chops into the hot skillet. In the spaces between the chops, add the butter and onions. Cook and stir the onions while the first side of the chops cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn the chops and continue cooking until the no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nPour white wine into the skillet; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir applesauce through the onion and wine mixture; simmer until the liquid thickens somewhat, about 5 minutes.\nPlate the pork chops and top with the apple and onion mixture to serve.",
