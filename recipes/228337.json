    "des": "\"An addictive alternative made with nutritional yeast. Who would have thought that leafy green chips loaded with nutrients could be so addictive? Nutritional yeast is deactivated yeast; it's not alive and has a slightly cheesy flavor which many vegans like to use as a cheese substitute. It can be found at most health food stores and some big-chain grocery stores.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).\nDrizzle olive oil over the kale in a large bowl and sprinkle with the nutritional yeast and salt. Stir with your hands to coat kale.\nSpread kale onto baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until kale begins to get slightly crisp; rotate racks and flip the chips, and continue baking until completely crisp, 45 to 60 minutes total. Make sure to keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn; if you notice certain chips ready much sooner than others, take them out.",
