    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBrush the turkey legs, red onion, Spanish onion, carrot, and red bell pepper with olive oil; place into a roasting pan.\nRoast in the preheated oven until the turkey and vegetables turn brown, about 15 minutes.\nPour 7 quarts water into a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the roasted turkey and vegetables, the garlic, and black peppercorns to the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer.\nPlace the roasting pan over a stove burner (two burners, if it will fit) and heat until the drippings sizzle. Pour in 1 cup of water and scrape up and dissolve all the browned flavor bits from the roasting pan into the water. Pour the drippings mixture into the stock.\nSimmer for 6 hours, periodically skimming and discarding the foamy scum that forms on the top of the broth. Pour the stock through a strainer, discarding the turkey and vegetables (they have given up all their flavor). Cool and store in airtight containers. Can be frozen.",
