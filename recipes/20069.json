    "des": "\"This is an original German sauerbraten recipe handed down to me. The meat is more tender, and flavorful the longer you marinade, I usually marinade for 2 days.\"",
    "ins": "Place meat in large, non-metal bowl.  In separate bowl, combine red wine vinegar, 1 cup water, lemon juice, onion, bay leaves, cloves, salt and pepper.  Pour over meat.  Cover and refrigerate 48 hours.\nHeat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Remove meat from marinade and brown in oil on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes a side.  Remove bay leaves and cloves from marinade.  Pour in 1 cup water and pour marinade into pan with meat.  Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 3 hours, or until tender.\nRemove meat from pan.  Increase heat and sprinkle flour, a little at a time, over juices, cooking until mixture thickens to form gravy.  Return meat to pan with tomato wedges, heat through and serve.",
