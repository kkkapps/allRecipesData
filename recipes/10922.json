Cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nIn another bowl, beat the eggs, milk, seeds and lemon zest until blended well. Add to the dry ingredients and blend until smooth. If the dough seems a bit stiff, add extra milk, one tablespoon at a time.\nOn a floured surface, roll dough out 1/4 inch thick and cut using a 2-inch round cutter.  lace cookies 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
