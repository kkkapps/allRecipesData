    "des": "\"I have been looking for a great restaurant-quality sour cream sauce enchilada recipe and was handed this one from a friend's grandma. It was exactly what I wanted and so simple to make! If you don't like really spicy foods, the optional items listed can be removed from the recipe and the dish is just as yummy!\"",
