    "des": "\"Not quite vegan, but tofu does make up the bulk of the creaminess in this lower-fat, higher-protein crustless version of chocolate cheesecake. Be sure to refrigerate the cake overnight for best outcome. You may want to make a cookie-crust with crushed Oreo\u00c2\u00ae cookies and butter. Using a high-quality cocoa powder will greatly improve your results.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9-inch spring-form pan.\nBlend tofu, cream cheese, maple syrup, coconut oil, cold butter, sucanat, cocoa powder, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a blender or food processor until smooth; pour into prepared spring-form pan.\nCover the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil and place it into a pan at least 1 inch larger than the spring-form pan. Pour about 1/2 inch water into the larger pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until mostly set, about 1 hour and 20 minutes; cool at room temperature until just warm before chilling completely in refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.",
