    "des": "\"My Aussie friend uses this recipe as her standard pancake recipe. Pikelets are the Scottish version of the southern British crumpet. They are also great for afternoon teas. Serve with fresh-squeezed lemon juice and sugar, or with butter and jam. I always thought that I had the best pancake recipe in the world until I tried these!\"",
