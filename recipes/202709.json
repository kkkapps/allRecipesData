    "ins": "Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Turn off heat; stir in rice noodles. Cover, and allow noodles to soak until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Rinse with cold water. Drain well.\nHeat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the mushrooms in the hot oil until they are browned and softened, about 2 minutes.  Remove the mushrooms from the pan. Reserve.\nHeat the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil in the pan.  Cook and stir the turkey in the oil until it is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.  Stir in the green onions, water chestnuts, ginger, and garlic; continue to cook for 1 minute.  Mix in the reserved mushrooms, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Simmer briefly to combine the flavors.  Take the pan off the heat; stir in the rice vinegar, sesame oil, and orange zest.\nTo assemble lettuce wraps, place a bit of turkey filling on each lettuce leaf.  Top each with cooked noodles, and a sprinkle of bean sprouts, carrots, peanuts, and cilantro.  Serve with sweet chili sauce for dipping.",
