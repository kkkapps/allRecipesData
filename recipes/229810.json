    "des": "\"This is a great way to liven up Brussels sprouts. The orange and ginger zing pair perfectly with the sprouts' floral flavors. I have a blood orange infused olive oil that I like to use with this recipe. It helps with the zing. Other dried fruits or nuts might be interesting experiments.\"",
    "ins": "Shred Brussels sprouts in a food processor.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shredded Brussels sprouts in the hot oil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; cook and stir pecans into the Brussels sprouts until pecans are fragrant and toasted, about 2 minutes.\nStir orange juice into Brussels sprouts mixture; fold in cranberries and ginger. Simmer mixture until juice is mostly evaporated, about 5 minutes.",
