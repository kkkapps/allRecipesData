    "des": "\"This is a West Indian marinade used for generations. It's best suited for fish and game. I like it on chicken and pork. Allow meat to marinate for at least an hour before cooking. Make sure you adjust the amount of chile peppers to your taste. Also, I sometimes replace the orange juice with marmalade for a sweeter marinade.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, combine the green onions, shallots, garlic, ginger, allspice, ground black pepper, chile peppers, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, brown sugar, orange juice, vinegar, wine, soy sauce, oil, and molasses. Mix well, cover, and allow to sit for one hour. Stir again before using with fish or meat. Discard any remaining sauce.",
