    "des": "\"A delicious stuffing for a special change from ordinary boiled or steamed artichokes.\"",
    "ins": "Snip the pointed tips of artichoke leaves, and cut off the stems.  Wash and drain.  Holding artichoke firmly by base, firmly rap the top of it on a hard surface; this will open it so it can be stuffed.\nIn a medium bowl combine bread cubes, garlic, parsley, Romano cheese, oregano,  2 tablespoons vegetable oil, salt and pepper; mix well.\nPress about 1/2 cup of stuffing into each artichoke.  Tightly pack stuffed artichokes together in a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven.  Add enough water to reach half way up artichokes and add 3 tablespoons oil.\nBring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour, or until leaves pull out easily.",
