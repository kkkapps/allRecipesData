Remove from heat and whisk into egg mixture, a little at a time, until fully incorporated.  Return mixture to double boiler and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Cook 2 minutes more, then remove from heat.   Cool completely.  Stir in vanilla.\nPreheat oven broiler.\nPour cooled mixture into a 1 quart, shallow baking dish and place dish in an ice bath, in a larger, ovenproof dish.
