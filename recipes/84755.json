    "des": "\"This is a great side-dish. Carrots and cauliflower are baked in a zesty hollandaise sauce. It may seem complicated but its very easy, as long as you have a blender.  Very creamy and zippy!! Not to mention DELICIOUS!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring about 2 inches of water to a boil in a large pot. Add cauliflower and carrots, and boil for about 7 minutes, until fork tender. Drain well, and transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nWhile the vegetables are cooking, combine the egg yolks, salt, lemon juice and hot pepper sauce in a blender or food processor. Blend for a few seconds to mix, then continue to blend while slowly pouring in 1/2 cup of hot melted butter. Continue blending until thickened. Pour this sauce over the vegetables in the baking dish. Stir together the cracker crumbs and remaining butter; sprinkle over the top of the casserole.\nBake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the casserole is bubbling, and the top is toasted. Let cool slightly before serving.",
