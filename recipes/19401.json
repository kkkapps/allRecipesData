    "des": "\"Family favorite for years, great way to get veggies into kids, and no separate side dishes. Top with fresh chopped parsley and/or parmesan if desired.  This stuff reheats great and I have used ground beef in it before, just brown it with the onions, drain then continue recipe.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as we have.\"",
