    "des": "\"Because I love green tea, I tried many different variations of this creamy dessert. I like it best made with a mixture of normal milk and soy milk because it gives it a smoother texture. Serve sprinkled with soybean flour (kinako) and black sugar syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Bring soy milk and milk to the boil in a heavy-based saucepan, stirring occasionally with a whisk. Add confectioners' sugar and green tea powder, whisking briskly so no lumps form. Stir gelatin into milk mixture and remove saucepan from heat.\nPlace the bottom of the pan in a bowl of ice-cold water; set aside until mixture starts to thicken. Add cream and gently stir. Pour the mixture through a sieve and then evenly pour into 6 small serving cups. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.",
