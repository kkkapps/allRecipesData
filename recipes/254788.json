    "des": "\"While this recipe is high in fat it works great for people on the Atkins diet. Even after eating two bowls per day I was still in ketosis. Heavy cream has no carbs which is why this works so well for folks on low-carb diets. Also fat is more filling, leading you to eat less and feel more full. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator. It's even better the second day. However, I've found if it sits longer than that the broccoli can become too strong.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken broth, cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, butter, and onion flakes in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Add heavy cream and chicken; bring to a gentle simmer.\nPlace a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a colander to drain excess moisture.\nPour chicken broth mixture into a slow cooker; add broccoli.\nCook on Low until flavors combine, about 4 hours.",
