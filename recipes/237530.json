    "des": "\"This is a colorful and simple recipe that works as a main dish or a side salad. To simplify, buy a prepared salad topper that contains the nuts and cranberries and enjoy. This is delicious to eat when still warm, as well as when it is chilled. If you prefer it cold, place in the refrigerator for one hour.\"",
