    "des": "\"Delicious, warm blueberry sauce which is fabulous on pancakes, waffles, cheesecake or ice cream!  Fresh or frozen blueberries work equally well.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the blueberries, 1/4 cup of water, orange juice, and sugar. Stir gently, and bring to a boil.\nIn a cup or small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water. Gently stir the cornstarch mixture into the blueberries so as not to mash the berries. Simmer gently until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the almond extract and cinnamon. Thin sauce with water if it is too thick for your liking.",
