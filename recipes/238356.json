Blend mixture again until smooth. Blend ground oats into the mixture until it begins to clump together. If more moisture is needed to achieve clumping, add more applesauce.\nTransfer the raisin mixture to a bowl. Mix remaining oats, remaining raisins, chocolate chips, and peanuts with the raisin mixture; roll by rounded tablespoon into small balls.",
