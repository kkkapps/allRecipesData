Lightly grease a large casserole dish.\nHeat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, garlic, oregano, and basil in the hot oil until onions are soft, 5 to 8 minutes.

Bring mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often.\nStir mozzarella cheese into chicken mixture and pour into prepared casserole dish.\nCombine baking mix with Parmesan cheese, almond milk, butter, and egg in a bowl to make a batter.
