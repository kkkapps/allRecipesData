    "des": "\"Rather than a risotto rice, I use pearled barley for this orzotto. Prep time is almost nil if you have a food processor to deal with chopping the onion for you. I like serving this with asparagus and Quorn\u00c2\u00ae 'chicken'. Parmesan balsamic sauces go well alongside this. You can substitute cream for the milk if you want it a bit heavier.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add barley to onion; cook and stir until barley is toasted, about 2 minutes.\nStir white wine into barley mixture until completely absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Add water, balsamic vinegar, and vegetable bouillon to barley; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat.\nMix milk, Parmesan cheese, and basil into barley.",
