    "des": "\"I just had to share this with you all! This soup, which is more like a stew, is sustaining enough to make a complete meal if accompanied by some good, crusty bread. The meat, combined with spices and with a tang of lemon and apricots, has the flavor of North Africa.\"",
    "ins": "Soak the apricots in water for 2 hours or more until soft; drain.\nHeat the olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add the garlic, cinnamon, cumin, and paprika; cook and stir for 1 minute.  Raise the heat to medium-high, crumble in the ground lamb, stirring and breaking it up with a wooden spoon for a few minutes until browned.  Stir in the drained apricots, celery, green pepper, and tomato.\nUsing a vegetable peeler, shave 5 - 6 strips of rind off the lemon and add to the soup with the juice of the lemon.  Stir in the water and sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer gently for half an hour. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
