    "des": "\"This stew brings back childhood memories of Northern California and new buckets brimming with crab and baskets of sourdough bread.  Rich, red, and very messy, it is now a New Years tradition at my house. Serve in large bowls with sourdough bread on the side. Never any leftovers!\"",

Pour in tomatoes and  white wine, then season with parsley, basil, salt, pepper and the bay leaf.

Cover, and cook over medium heat until clams open. Scoop portions into large bowls to serve.",
