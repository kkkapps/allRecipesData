    "ins": "Combine cucumbers, onion, red bell pepper, and ghost chile peppers in a large pot; add salt and toss to coat. Cover pot with a lid and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nMix sugar and vinegar into cucumber mixture and simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until relish is tender, about 45 minutes.\nSterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 10 minutes. Pack relish into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Label and date the jars and store in a cool, dark area.",
