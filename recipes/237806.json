    "des": "\"I created this recipe when I ran out of pasta and needed to make a quick salad for a potluck. This versatile recipe has become one of our favorites for taking to picnics and for eating after a workout. Eat immediately or refrigerate 2 hours to overnight for best flavor. Quinoa really soaks up the dressing, so you may want to add more to taste after the refrigeration period.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water, quinoa, and chicken bouillon to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool quinoa to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nMix quinoa, tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese, and red onion together in a bowl. Pour Italian dressing over quinoa mixture and stir to coat.",
