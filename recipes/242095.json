    "des": "\"Other recipes on this site for mayo just were not thick-n'-tangy enough. This recipe must use only egg yolks for maximum thickness. For those who want no waste, take those egg whites and cook yourself some eggs. I also don't recommend using a blender. I tried and got mayo on my face.\"",
    "ins": "Beat egg yolks, vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, mustard, and salt together in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer. Increase mixer speed to high and slowly pour oil into egg mixture, beating until mayonnaise is thick and creamy. Transfer mayonnaise to a jar and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 hour.",
