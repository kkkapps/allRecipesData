Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on both side, about 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.\nStir peanut butter and about 1/2 cup simple syrup in a bowl until smooth, adding more syrup as needed. Serve peanut butter sauce on top or as a dipping sauce.",
