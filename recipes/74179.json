    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix together the Bloody Mary mix, hot pepper sauce, and lemon juice. Stir in the shrimp and halibut chunks. Let marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.\nPreheat a grill for high heat. Place a grill pan over the grilling surface, or you may use a heavy sheet of foil that has holes poked in it with a fork.\nDrain the shrimp and halibut in a colander, discarding the marinade. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the seafood is browned and opaque.",
