    "ins": "Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper; cook in skillet until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chops from pan to a plate.\nPour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir brown sugar in to the wine mixture. Add the pluots, place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the pluots break down into a thick sauce, about 10 minutes.\nReturn pork chops to the skillet and continue to cook until pork chops warm and are slightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
