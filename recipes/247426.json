    "des": "\"A simple, safe, and tasty way to prepare delicious fresh chanterelle mushrooms, which are so abundant in Northwest forests during the fall season. They have a sweet, peach-like flavor that is enhanced by red wine and a wonderful complement to meat. This is a hearty side dish to accompany your favorite grilled meat like a flatiron steak or other favorite red meat.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat until sizzling but not smoking. Stir in garlic. Add chanterelles and butter. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until most of the excess liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nIncrease heat to high and carefully pour port into the skillet; stir until reduced, about 2 minutes. Serve steaming hot.",
