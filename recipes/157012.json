    "ins": "Fill a large pot about 3/4 full with water; bring to a boil. Add diced potatoes and cook until fork-tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in green onions and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in spinach and sorrel; cook another 2 to 3 minutes, or until wilted; remove from heat.\nPour the beaten eggs into the mixture in a slow and steady stream, stirring constantly, until the soup thickens. Season with salt, sugar, and vinegar to get a slightly sweet and tangy taste. Pour soup into a large bowl; allow soup to cool before transferring to the refrigerator to chill completely.\nGarnish with any combination of cucumber, chopped egg, sour cream, and dill.",
