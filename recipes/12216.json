    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Line a pan with half the pastry and chill.\nPlace the raisins and 2/3 cup of the water in a saucepan and heat over medium heat for 5 minutes.\nCombine the sugars, cornstarch, spices, and salt in a bowl and, mixing all the time, slowly add the remaining water. Add this mixture to the heating raisins. Cook and stir until the mixture starts to bubble. Add the vinegar and butter and heat until the butter is melted. Cool until room temperature.\nPour into the prepared shell and top with the second crust. Bake 25 minutes or until golden. Cool completely before serving.",
