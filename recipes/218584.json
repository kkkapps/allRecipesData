    "des": "\"My picky boyfriend always eats seconds of this. It's like enchiladas without the tortillas. Serve over rice -- we like to serve with yellow rice or Mexican rice.  You will want something to soak up all the delicious sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Place the flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper into a large plastic bag. Close the bag and shake a few times to mix the seasonings, and drop in the chicken pieces, a few at a time. Shake the bag to coat the chicken with seasoned flour.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion and green pepper in the oil until the onion is translucent, about 6 minutes. Stir in butter, and allow to melt. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet, and cook and stir until the chicken pieces are browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.\nIncrease heat to medium-high, and pour in chicken broth; stir in the chipotle peppers with adobo sauce. Bring to a boil, and reduce the chicken broth by half, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in the sour cream to make a smooth sauce, and sprinkle with cilantro to serve.",
