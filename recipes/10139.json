    "ins": "Heat milk over low heat until just below boiling.  Remove from  heat;stir in butter, honey and salt.  Set aside and let cool.\nIn a large bowl, combine yeast and lukewarm water.  Set aside 5 minutes for yeast to soften.  Add cooled milk mixture to softened yeast and beat in 4 cups flour.\nKnead dough in a bowl, adding up to 1/2 cup more flour if necessary, until a smooth, soft dough forms.  Divide dough into 8 balls 3 inches in diameter.  Place balls 4 inches apart on lightly greased cookie sheets; pat into 4 inch rounds.  Set aside, lightly covered with kitchen towels, about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).\nBake raised rounds 30 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove from oven; leave oven on.  Let cool on sheets 10-15 minutes, or until cool enough to handle.\nWith a serrated knife, cut each round into six 1/2-inch slices.  Place slices, cut sides down, on cookie sheets and return to oven 5 minutes.  Turn slices and bake 5 to 7 min. longer, or until golden on both sides.  Turn off heat and leave zwieback in unopened oven until cool, about 45 minutes.  Store in a tightly covered container.",
