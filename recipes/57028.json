    "des": "\"It's taken me several years to perfect this recipe. Now everyone asks, 'When are you making the eggnog?!' This uses cooked eggs for safety, and you can use more or less rum to taste.  It's a bit of work to make, but well worth it.  You'll never buy store-bought eggnog again! Enjoy!\"",

Slowly bring milk mixture to a boil.\nIn a large bowl, combine egg yolks and sugar.  Whisk together until fluffy.  Whisk hot milk mixture slowly into the eggs. Pour mixture into saucepan.
