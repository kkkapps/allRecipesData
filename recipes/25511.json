    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, thoroughly mix ground beef chuck, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise and dry onion soup mix.\nSpread even amounts of the ground beef onto the bottom half of each roll. Place top halves on, forming little sandwiches. If you purchased the rolls in aluminum foil pans, you may return them to the same pan for baking. Otherwise, place them on a baking sheet or baking pan. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.\nBake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until meat is cooked through.",
