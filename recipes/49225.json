    "des": "\"Inspired by my Greek mother-in-law's Kokkinisto. I decided to add clams for something different. Spoon over rice or angel hair pasta, sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese, and serve with crusty bread and white wine.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan, saute the onion, celery, and garlic in 2 tablespoons olive oil until tender.  Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, and clams. Season with bay leaves, chili pepper flakes, oregano, and salt and pepper to taste. Cover, and simmer for 1 hour, until tomatoes begin to turn deep red in colour and the sauce thickens.  Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil near the end of the cooking time.",
