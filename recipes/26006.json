We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs. Important: be sure to use only fresh eggs for this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Butter a 9 inch springform pan, and line bottom with parchment paper.\nIn the top of a double boiler, heat chocolate and unsalted butter, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.\nIn a large bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar until thick and lemon-colored. Fold into chocolate mixture; set aside. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Pour 2/3 of mixture into prepared pan. Cover and refrigerate remaining 1/3 of mousse.\nBake in the preheated oven for 40 to minutes, or until filling is just firm in the center. Allow to cool, then remove from pan and refrigerate 1 hour. Spread remaining mousse over cooled cake and refrigerate overnight.",
