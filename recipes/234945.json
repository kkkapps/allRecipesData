    "ins": "Mix peanut butter, powdered milk, and honey together in a bowl until mixture resembles a soft dough. This will be the 'flesh' of the fingers.\nMold enough dough around each pretzel rod, making sure to cover the ends. The pretzels will be the 'bones' of the fingers.\nUse the tip of a teaspoon the make marks on the 'flesh' similar to knuckles.\nPush 1 sliced almond onto 1 end of each 'finger' to resemble a finger nail.\nPlace jam in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until softened, 20 to 30 seconds. Dip the end opposite the 'finger nail' into the jam for the 'blood'.",
