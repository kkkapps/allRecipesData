    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Tear off four 15-inch sheets of Reynolds Parchment Paper.  Fold each sheet in half and crease it in the center.  Cut each into a heart shape; unfold.\nDivide broccoli and shrimp evenly on one-half of each sheet near crease.\nMix garlic, sesame oil, ginger and soy sauce.  Spoon 1/4 the mixture evenly over broccoli and shrimp on each sheet.\nFold over other half of each sheet to enclose ingredients.  Starting at top, make small overlapping folds down entire length of parchment to secure edges together.  Twist last fold several times to make a tight seal.  Place parchment packets on a large baking sheet with 1-inch sides.\nBake 13 to 15 minutes or until shrimp is done.\nPlace parchment packets on dinner plates.  Carefully cut an X in the top of each packet; open carefully, allowing steam to escape.  Serve immediately.",
