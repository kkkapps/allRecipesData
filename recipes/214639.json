    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the chicken thighs in the hot oil until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Stir in the onion, and cook and stir until the onion begins to turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and cook and stir an additional minute. Remove from heat.\nMix the water and rice together in the prepared baking dish, and combine the chicken, onion, and garlic, with any pan juices, with the rice. Stir in mango, cilantro, green onion, and ginger. In a small bowl, mash the red curry paste with the chicken broth and tarragon vinegar to make a thin paste, and stir into the dish. Cover the dish with foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the vegetables are tender and the rice is cooked, about 1 hour.",
