    "des": "\"A recipe that my mom used to make when we were little and picky about what we ate. Now I feed it to my family and friends and everybody loves it! Good for a day when you don't want to stand at a stove forever but still want a really nice meal. For more flavor, you can add already mixed Italian dressing to the mayo and dry Italian blend.\"",
    "ins": "Set slow cooker to High and melt butter in the bottom of the crock. Mix mayonnaise with Italian salad dressing mix in a bowl and stir chicken pieces into the mixture to coat. Pour the chicken mixture into the slow cooker over the butter. Cover and cook until chicken is tender, 4 to 5 hours, stirring occasionally.",
