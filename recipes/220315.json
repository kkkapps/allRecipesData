    "des": "\"This pasta salad is not only delicious, but very versatile. It can be used as an appetizer or a side dish. It's great because it is not a traditional pasta salad. It's something I came up with for my daughter's 1st birthday and have been making ever since.\"",
    "ins": "Place a baking rack in the top of the oven.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nLine a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nSpread asparagus spears and eggplant slices on the baking sheet, and drizzle vegetables with 1/4 cup olive oil; sprinkle with garlic powder.\nRoast the asparagus and eggplant in the preheated oven until tender, 12 to 15 minutes.\nRemove from oven and cool. When cool, roughly chop the vegetables; set aside.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still slightly firm, about 9 minutes. Drain well.\nTransfer about 1/4 of the penne at a time into a large salad bowl, drizzling each batch with about 1 teaspoon of olive oil and a 1 teaspoon of Parmesan cheese. Stir between additions.\nStir in roasted asparagus and eggplant, lemon juice, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce until thoroughly combined.\nSprinkle pasta salad with salt-free seasoning and black pepper.\nCover the bowl and refrigerate the pasta salad until thoroughly chilled and the flavors have blended, at least 3 hours.",
