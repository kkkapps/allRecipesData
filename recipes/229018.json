    "des": "\"These meatballs with spicy Italian turkey sausage, spicy Italian ground turkey, Cheddar cheese, egg, onion, and seasoning are great for snack or in your spaghetti. I use these as a great snack item. I use small snack-size bags, place three in each bag, and freeze. I'll have one serving of three as a snack by removing them from snack bag and reheating them for 60 to 75 seconds.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix sausage, ground turkey, eggs, Cheddar cheese, onion, and black pepper in a large bowl; roll into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs onto baking sheets.\nBake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 18 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
