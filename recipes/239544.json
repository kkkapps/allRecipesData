    "des": "\"I can see where a recipe title with the words 'fried' and 'butter' appearing one after the other may scare a few people off, but there's no reason to be alarmed. This pan-fried butter beans recipe is delicious, super-easy, and yes, good for you. You can substitute sherry vinegar for the white wine vinegar, if desired. You can substitute other fresh herbs for the rosemary, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir beans into hot oil until slightly golden and crispy, about 10 minutes. Stir garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into beans; continue cooking until crispy, about 5 minutes. Drizzle vinegar over beans and toss.",
