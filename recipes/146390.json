    "des": "\"Prosciutto and pate fill these chicken rolls, fried in a pan and then baked until perfection.  Perfect with a classic French sauce such as au jus.  Sound hard, but are really very simple and worth it!\"",
    "ins": "Cut pate into 12 rectangles, and place onto a plate lined with plastic wrap. Place into the freezer. Combine chicken thighs and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Seal with plastic wrap, and place in refrigerator to marinate for 1 hour.\nGently fry the prosciutto in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat until crispy. Drain, cool and crumble into a bowl. Season with garlic powder to taste; set aside.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove chicken thighs from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Discard marinade. Lay the chicken thighs out flat on a clean work surface. Season with salt and pepper, then sprinkle crumbled prosciutto in the center. Place a cube of pate on top of the prosciutto, then wrap the thigh around the filling and secure with toothpicks.\nHeat corn oil in a large skillet over high heat. Place thighs into oil, and cook until browned all over, about 5 minutes. When browned, place thighs seam side down into a glass baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes, depending on size.",
