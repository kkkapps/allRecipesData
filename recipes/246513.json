    "des": "\"If a vegan cheese ball scares you, you are probably not alone. Don't let that stop you from trying this vegan treat. It won't taste exactly like dairy cheese, but it is delicious in a way all it's own. Also, it is good just as a cheese spread, if the seasonings are mixed in. Use within 7 days.\"",
    "ins": "Place wheat berries in a bowl. Pour in enough water to cover by a few inches; let soak until berries expand, 8 hours to overnight. Drain. Rinse berries twice a day, for 3 to 4 days, until berries sprout and grow short tails.\nPlace sprouted berries in a bowl and cover with 2 cups water. Let sit at room temperature, 12 to 24 hours, until soaking liquid turns cloudy, fizzy, and smells a little tart.\nCover cashews with water and soak, 8 hours to overnight. Drain.\nCombine drained cashews and 1 cup of the soaking liquid in a high-powdered blender. Blend until smooth.\nPour blended mixture into a sieve lined with a coffee filter and set over a bowl; drain in the refrigerator until thickened, about 24 hours.\nCombine pecans, garlic salt, and Mexican-style chili powder in a food processor; pulse until a coarse mixture is formed.\nForm the strained cashew mixture into a ball. Coat with pecan mixture.",
