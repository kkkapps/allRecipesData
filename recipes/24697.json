    "ins": "Line a 9x9 inch dish with buttered foil.\nIn a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.  Stir in sugar, milk, corn syrup and salt.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Continue to heat, without stirring, to 242 to 248 degrees F (116 to 120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball.  Remove from heat and stir in anise and food coloring.  Pour into prepared pan.  Let cool completely, several hours.\nTo cut, turn out of pan and peel away foil.  Cut with a buttered knife.  Wrap pieces in waxed paper or candy wrappers.",
