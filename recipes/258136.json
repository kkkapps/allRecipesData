Cook until softened, add garlic, and cook for additional 2 minutes.\nAdd red pepper flakes and fresh thyme, followed by flour. Reduce heat and cook for 2 more minutes to cook raw taste from flour.\nAdd chicken stock and heavy cream, and bring to simmer, whisking frequently.\nAdd mustard and cheddar cheese, and stir to incorporate. Add reserved sausage and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to individual ovenproof serving dishes.\nIn food processor, or by hand, roughly chop pretzels to make crumbs. Toss with melted butter and top each serving dish with crumb mixture.\nBake until golden brown and warmed through, approximately 12 to 15 minutes.",
