    "ins": "Melt butter in a large pot over high heat.  Saute mushrooms in butter until liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.  Stir in garlic, thyme, and rosemary, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth, and simmer until liquid evaporates. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\nPreheat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Butter a 13x9x2 inch baking dish.\nArrange 1/3 of the potatoes in prepared dish, overlapping slightly.  Spread half of the mushroom mixture evenly over the potatoes, and then sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese over mushrooms.  Repeat layering, and then arrange remaining potatoes on top.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the half and half, heavy cream, 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.  Pour mixture over potatoes.  Cover loosely with foil.\nPlace baking dish on middle rack in oven.  Bake until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Uncover. Sprinkle remaining cheese over potatoes.  Bake until cheese melts, about 15 minutes longer.",
