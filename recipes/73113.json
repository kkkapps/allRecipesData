    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine the spinach, apples, Cheddar cheese and walnuts.  Toss lightly to blend.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, maple syrup and olive oil. Pour over the salad, and stir to coat. I like to use a bowl with a lid so I can shake the ingredients. Serve immediately.",
