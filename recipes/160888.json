    "des": "\"An exquisite after-dinner cocktail. Potent and spicy notes going down with a nice long, cooling dark chocolate finish. Styled after some Mexican chocolate cupcakes I adore, and the more traditional Mexican hot chocolate. The key to any great martini is good liquor, use the best you have and you won't be disappointed.\"",
    "ins": "Pour the vodka, chocolate liqueur, coffee liqueur, and schnapps into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into a chilled martini glass to serve.",
