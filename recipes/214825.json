    "ins": "Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat.\nSpread one side of each slice of bread with 1 teaspoon butter. Place one slice, butter-side down in the hot skillet. Top with Swiss cheese and ham. Spread the unbuttered side of the second slice of bread with mayonnaise and mustard; place it, butter-side up on top of the sandwich. Cook until the sandwich is golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side.",
