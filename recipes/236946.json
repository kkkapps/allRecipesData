    "des": "\"Making marinara sauce is literally one of my favorite things in the world to do. There is almost no way to go wrong other than adding too much salt or too much sugar. Just blend, simmer, and let the ingredients speak for themselves. For a spicier sauce add more chili flake.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot stockpot until browned, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.\nBlend tomato sauce, tomato, red wine, garlic, onion, Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar, basil, olive oil, thyme, oregano, black pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, and brown sugar together in a blender until desired consistency is reached. Pour mixture over sausage; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until wine has cooked off, at least 30 minutes.",
