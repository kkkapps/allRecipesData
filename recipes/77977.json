    "des": "\"This is an old family recipe.  If you like wild rice, try this with your turkey!  You won't be disappointed!  (This recipe will stuff a 12 lb. bird.  Can be easily doubled for larger bird.  You can stuff it and cook it in the bird, or cook it in a dish as stated below.)\"",
    "ins": "Dissolve 3 cubes bouillon in 1 cup hot water. In a medium saucepan, combine wild rice with bouillon water, then fill with just enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nMix remaining 1 cube bouillon in 1 cup hot water. Heat butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in celery and green pepper; cook until tender. Mix in remaining bouillon water. Pour skillet contents into a large bowl. Stir together cooked rice, croutons, and poultry seasoning.\nStuff turkey loosely, and cook turkey as directed. Or put stuffing into a well greased baking dish, cover, and bake 30 minutes in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F (165 degree C).",
