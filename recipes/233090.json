Transfer mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nCombine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut 7 tablespoons butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles a coarse crumb. Stir milk into crumbles until topping is just moistened. Spoon topping over apricot mixture. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sugar over topping.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.",
