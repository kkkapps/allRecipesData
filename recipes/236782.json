Add roast beef to skillet. Saute over medium-high heat until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.\nTo assemble sandwiches, open each hoagie bun lengthwise and divide roast beef slices among the rolls. Top with vegetables, about 1/4 cup of Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional Sauce, and one slice of provolone cheese. (Heat remainder of sauce for dipping, if desired.)\nPlace hoagies on a baking sheet and bake for about 3 to 5 minutes until cheese is melted. Serve hot and enjoy!",
