Heat to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove saucepan from heat and stir vanilla extract into syrup.\nDrizzle syrup over cereal mixture and toss to coat.\nBake cereal mixture in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; stir and continue baking for 30 minutes more. Spread cereal mixture in 1 layer onto 2 lightly buttered baking sheets, separating any large chunks with 2 forks; allow to cool.",
