    "des": "\"Jalapenos stuffed with marinated shrimp are wrapped in bacon and grilled.  My husband got this recipe from a friend. We were all dubious about my husband attempting any sort of cooking but this recipe is delicious and super easy. Perfect for a night where you want to whip something up quick and great served on a bed of yellow rice.\"",

Thread onto skewers, 5 shrimp per skewer.\nLightly oil the grill grate.  Place skewers on the grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until the bacon has browned and the shrimp are pink.",
