    "des": "\"Pioneers didn't have much, but what they did have they made the best of.  This is a cross between dumplings and noodles, uses only 4 ingredients and is a great comfort food. We have never modified it from the original recipe which has been passed in our family I think forever.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Add the milk and egg, and mix until it forms a dough. Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Roll out to your desired thickness for dumplings or you can roll thinner for noodles. Cut into strips, squares, or any shape you like. Let dry while you prepare broth or soup.\nDrop dumplings into boiling broth, and cook until tender. Time will depend on the thickness of the dumplings and how dry they were.",
