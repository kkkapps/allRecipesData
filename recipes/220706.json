    "des": "\"I made these cupcakes for Easter and they were a great success. They're easy and festive. I separated the mix into 3 bowls and added a different flavor of drink mix to each bowl - about a tablespoon to each bowl. I used grape, cherry, and orange. Frost however you like and decorate with sprinkles, colored sugar, etc.\"",
