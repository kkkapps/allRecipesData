    "des": "\"This meal is great for a quick dinner after work. Veal comes out of oven moist and delicious! I paired with baked yams and broccoli. All ingredients are commonly found in the house and can be put together last minute.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhisk egg, lemon juice, and milk in a small bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl; mix Italian crumbs, pecorino Romano cheese, and adobo seasoning in a third bowl.\nHeat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dredge each veal piece in flour, dip in egg mixture, and press into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides. Pan-fry the breaded veal cutlets in the hot oil until crumbs are lightly browned and coating is set, about 1 minute per side. Transfer veal to a baking dish.\nBake cutlets in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer veal onto 4 serving plates and top each cutlet with 1/4 of the arugula; sprinkle raisins over the arugula. Drizzle a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon olive oil over each serving.",
