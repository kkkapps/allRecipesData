    "des": "\"This is another recipe that my boyfriend and I made up. We decided that the normal combo pizza was getting boring so we spiced it up - A LOT. This recipe may not be for the weak at heart. It has some great ingredients such as German salami, portobello mushrooms, and jerk sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven broiler. Brush the green pepper with 1 teaspoon olive oil, and place on a baking sheet. Broil about 5 minutes on each side, until skin begins to scorch. Remove from heat, and seal in a plastic container for 15 minutes. Cut into strips, remove seeds, pulp, and skin, and dice.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the chicken 10 minutes, until juices run clear. Mix in the roasted green pepper, jerk sauce, garlic, and portobello mushroom. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until heated through.\nPlace the pizza crust on a pizza pan, and spread with pizza sauce. Arrange the salami, then the chicken mixture evenly over the sauce. Top with mozzarella cheese.\nBake pizza 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.",
