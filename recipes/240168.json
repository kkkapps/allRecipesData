    "des": "\"Tasty and quick imitation crabmeat appetizer sure to please a crowd. Prepare with enough time to chill! This tastes best with the addition of Tiger Sauce. If you cannot find it (usually in the ketchup/condiment section) and use cocktail sauce instead, remember cocktail sauce contains horseradish and adjust your ingredients accordingly!\"",
    "ins": "Pulse crabmeat in a food processor several times until minced. Transfer crabmeat to a large bowl. Blend cream cheese in food processor until creamy. Add onion, horseradish, and Worcestershire sauce to cream cheese; blend until smooth.\nStir cream cheese mixture into crab mixture until well-combined. For crab mixture into 2 to 3 balls, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm and chilled, at least 1 hour. Place crab balls on a platter and top with cocktail sauce.",
