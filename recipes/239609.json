    "des": "\"Hale and hearty, this kale salad is a powerhouse of nutrients that is very easy to eat! The salad bursts with the flavor of mandarin oranges, sweet and tart strawberries, and has a pleasant poppy seed dressing. When mangoes are in season, you can substitute them for the mandarin oranges or walnuts and pomegranates, toasted cashews or walnuts, and apples in the fall for different flavors. The possibilities are endless!\"",
