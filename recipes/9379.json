    "des": "\"The richest dessert I've ever tasted! A sort of a caramel pudding. It's so rich you'll probably only want a small serving . . . You can substitute Cool Whip for the real whipped cream if you want to save some calories, fat, and/or money in this recipe. (The way it stands, it costs over $15.00 to make!)\"",
    "ins": "Remove labels from the cans of milk and put them unopened into a large pot of gently boiling water. Boil for about 3 hours. Make sure the water doesn't boil away or the cans will explode (or so I'm told).\nAfter 3 hours, take the cans out and cool in fridge.\nWhen chilled, open the cans and put the results into a bowl.\nBeat the whipping cream, and fold into the \"caramel sauce\" (cooked, cooled condensed milk). Mix in the nuts and cherries.",
