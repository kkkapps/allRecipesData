    "des": "\"A truly unique looking and tasty pie! Requires some effort but is well worth it for that special occasion. If preferred, use one small pumpkin instead of butternut squash.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan, combine sweet potato, squash, and carrots. Pour in enough water to cover vegetables. Cook over low heat until very tender, about 40 minutes. Drain and mash. Allow to cool.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12 inch pie pan.\nTo mashed squash mixture, add 2 eggs, butter or margarine, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, brown sugar, curry powder, cumin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Puree mixture in blender or food processor.\nIn food processor or blender, combine spinach, 2 eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and half and half. Puree until smooth. Stir in 2 tablespoons bread crumbs. If mixture is still liquidy, add more bread crumbs. Pour spinach mixture into pie pan, flattening with a spoon.\nGently pour squash mixture on top of spinach layer. Flatten partially with a spoon, but leave a few waves. Do not spread squash mixture all the way to edges of pan; allow spinach mixture to 'peek' through edges. Using a spoon, gently stir the two mixtures to create a marbled effect. Do not overmix.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until set in center.",
