    "des": "\"This is a very simple solution for the leftover bread and cheese from last night's party. Tossing the bread with olive oil before assembling the dish makes the top crunchy and very tasty--reminiscent of good, homemade croutons, which is exactly what it is.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nHeat olive oil in a cast iron pan, and cook onion and rosemary in oil until onion is soft.\nToss bread cubes with olive oil and onions. Exact measurement of bread is not necessary. Place in a well oiled, deep sided, 9 inch square pan.  Toss with 1/2 cheese, and sprinkle remaining cheese over the top.\nBeat together milk, cream, and eggs. Pour over bread in pan. It is fine that the bread sticks out of the custard.\nBake for 1 hour, or until browned and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean (except for melted cheese).",
