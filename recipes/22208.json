    "ins": "Butter a 9x9 inch dish.\nCombine milk, sugar and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; boil.  Stir in strawberries and lemon juice.  Heat, stirring constantly, to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.\nRemove from heat and quickly spread in prepared pan.  Let cool before cutting and serving.",
