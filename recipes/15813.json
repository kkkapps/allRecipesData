    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium high heat, combine the beans, tomato sauce, chicken stock and onions. Bring to a low boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.\nUsing a potato masher, carefully mash some of the beans in the soup to make it a little thicker, if desired. Add the bacon and serve.",
