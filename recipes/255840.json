    "des": "\"This fried chicken recipe has Haitian roots. It varies from traditional American recipes but is just as good. The longer you leave it to marinate, the better. You may sprinkle freshly squeezed lemon juice on top if you like.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken legs, lemon juice, onion, garlic, seasoned salt, paprika, thyme, pepper, and cloves in a large bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry chicken in batches until golden brown, about 8 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.",
