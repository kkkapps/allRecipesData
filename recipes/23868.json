    "des": "\"After trying the most wonderful potato soup at a local market I tried to come home and duplicate it. It didn't turn out exactly the way I wanted but I found my version better. I got the name Potato Chowder soup because when my husband tried it he thought it tasted like a chowder. Also a can of corn could be added as a quick variation. Very tasty and warms the soul on a dreary damp day.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp.  Remove bacon from pan, leaving drippings.  Cook onion in drippings until tender.  Stir in celery salt, potatoes, carrot and broth.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, 20 minutes.  Stir in milk, seasoning salt, dill and pepper.  Heat through and serve.",
