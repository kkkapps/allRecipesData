    "ins": "Fry bacon in a stockpot over medium heat until it is semi-crispy, about 5 minutes. Stir in potatoes and onion and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in mushrooms, garlic powder, and onion powder; cook and stir until mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes more.\nPour water and milk over mushroom mixture, add thyme and flour, and bring to a boil. Boil until potatoes are very soft, adding water as needed, about 20 minutes. Crush some of the potatoes with a wooden spoon to reach a creamier consistency. Season with salt and pepper.",
