    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, butter and cocoa.  Press onto bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch springform pan.  Set crust aside.\nBeat cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add sweetened condensed milk; beat well. Add vanilla and eggs, and beat on medium speed until smooth. Toss 1/3 of the miniature chocolate chips with the 1 teaspoon flour to coat (this keeps them from sinking to the bottom of the cake).  Mix into cheese mixture. Pour into prepared crust. Sprinkle top with remaining chocolate chips.\nBake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 1 hour. Turn off oven (do not open oven door) and leave the cake in the oven to cool in the oven for another hour.  Remove from oven and cool completely. Refrigerate before removing sides of pan. Keep cake refrigerated until time to serve.",
