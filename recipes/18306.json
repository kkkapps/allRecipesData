    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSlice bacon in half (easiest to slice whole package at once right down the middle). Bundle 6 to 7 green beans together and wrap one slice of bacon around the middle of the bundle. Secure with a toothpick. Arrange bundles in one layer in a baking dish. Pour French dressing over all of the bundles - make sure to drizzle some on each bundle.\nBake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 30 minutes or until the bacon is done.",
