    "des": "\"This recipe originally uses apples, but with peach season in full swing here in the Ozarks, these sweet little tangy fruits made the perfect turnovers. Add a dash of cinnamon and pair with homemade vanilla ice cream and your friends and family will be begging for more.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut peaches into 16 crescent-shaped slices.\nUnroll crescent roll dough on a flat work surface and separate into 16 triangles. Place a peach slice at the base of each triangle and roll up to enclose in the dough. Arrange turnovers in a baking pan.\nMelt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Pour evenly over the turnovers in the baking pan. Pour citrus-flavored soda over the turnovers. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until turnovers are golden brown and liquid is bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.",
