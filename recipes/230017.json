    "des": "\"In my husband's family, we have a tradition of making a variety of appetizers as our meal for Christmas Eve. My sister-in-law brought these one year and they have been one of our favorites ever since. I don't generally use the large stuffing mushrooms, though you can if you're serving this as a first or second course in a formal dinner. Instead I use regular button mushrooms so 15 or so people can have two or three each.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRemove and finely chop stems from mushrooms.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over low heat; brush mushroom caps with melted butter and place onto a baking sheet. Raise heat to medium; cook and stir chopped mushroom stems, green onion, and garlic in the butter remaining in the skillet for 3 minutes. Lightly stir bread crumbs, Cheddar cheese, pecans, salt, and black pepper into the mixture. Generously fill the mushroom caps with stuffing, piling it high.\nBake in the preheated oven until stuffing is hot, the cheese has melted, and mushrooms are cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes.",
