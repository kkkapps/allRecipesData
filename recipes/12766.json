    "des": "\"Being of Portuguese descent and raised in Rhode Island along the Eastern seaboard, this recipe is a wonderful combination of my two heritages. If desired serve with a small cup of melted butter for dipping clams and don't forget a fresh loaf of warm, crusty bread!!! Note: If the clams seem sandy, soak them for a couple of hours or overnight in the refrigerator in salted water with a bit of vinegar, cornmeal, and cayenne pepper.\"",
    "ins": "Wash clams well in a sink of cold water. Discard any clams that are already opened.\nIn a large stock pot with a tight fitting lid, place the cleaned clams. Add the sausage, onion, tomatoes and wine. Cover and set over high heat. Steam until all the clams open up. Be sure to shake the pan often to insure even heat.\nDrizzle olive oil over the cooked clams. Evenly divide all the ingredients into warm soup plates. Divide the broth into side cups for dipping.",
