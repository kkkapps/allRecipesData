    "des": "\"Button mushrooms are battered and fried in oil for an irresistible snack. These are great for watching sports.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and garlic salt. Mix in egg and water until smooth.\nHeat the oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Test to see if oil is hot by frying a drop of batter. If it sizzles and floats to the top, the oil is ready.\nDip mushrooms into the batter and then place in the hot oil. Fry a few at a time so they are not crowded, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.",
