Repeat with the remaining cream until all is moistened.  Form into a ball.   \nRoll the dough to slightly less than 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into rounds with a 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter.  Sprinkle one side of each round with sugar and place on an  ungreased cookie sheet, sugar side up.   \nPrick each round in four  parallel rows with a fork.   \nBake for 8-10 minutes or until the edges just begin to brown.  Remove to a rack and cool completely.   \nMake filling as follows.  Stir together the powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon softened butter,   vanilla, food coloring, and enough of the 1 tablespoon cream to make it spreadable.   \nSpread 1/2 teaspoon of the filling on the flat side of half of the cookies.  Top with the remaining cookies, flat side down.   ",
