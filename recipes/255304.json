    "des": "\"While certainly not light on the calorie counter, this berry fool (from the French 'fouler' meaning 'to mash') is shockingly airy on the palate. It's that contrast between the rich, fluffy cream and the syrupy, tangy fruit that makes this so much greater than the sum of its parts.\u00c2\u00a0Fresh berries are a classic, but this would work with peeled, diced, ripe peaches.\"",
    "ins": "Place raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries in a bowl. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and 1/4 cup sugar. Stir until sugar is mixed with fruit and juices begin to form. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.\nPlace heavy cream and creme fraiche in a cold bowl. Add 1 tablespoon sugar and vanilla extract. Whisk until mixture has soft peaks and sharp lines, 5 to 8 minutes.\nPlace some cookie crumbs in the bottom of each serving dish. Spoon in some of the fruit and a layer of whipped cream. Repeat layers, ending with a sprinkle of cookie crumbs.",
