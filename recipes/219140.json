    "des": "\"A while back I had to make drinks for a Harry Potter Club meeting, but all the recipes I found for firewhiskey involved either hot sauce, alcohol, or both. We were all underage, and carbonated Tabasco doesn't appeal to me, so I created this. We Muggles enjoyed it immensely, and I hope you will too. This goes great with any other Harry Potter-themed food. I made 'Cockroach Clusters,' 'Pumpkin Pasties,' and vegetable wands. Good for cold days as well.\"",
