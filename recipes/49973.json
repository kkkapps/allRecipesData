    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, and cook on each side until browned. Reduce heat to medium, cover skillet, and cook until chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. Remove from skillet, cool slightly, and slice into strips.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the yogurt and garlic. Season with salt to taste. Tear pita breads into pieces, and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place chicken strips in a layer over the bread. Cover with the yogurt mixture. Sprinkle chickpeas and pine nuts over the top. Let stand for about 10 minutes to blend flavors, then serve. No need to heat up.",
