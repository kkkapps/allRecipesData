    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBlend almonds in a blender or food processor to the consistency of bread crumbs. Transfer ground almonds to a shallow dish and add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\nPlace chicken in a resealable plastic bag and pound, using a meat mallet, until about 1-inch thick.\nPress chicken into almond mixture until evenly coated.\nHeat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook chicken until a nice crust forms, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nHeat pasta sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour over cooked chicken and top with remaining Parmesan cheese.\nTurn on oven's broiler. Broil chicken Parmesan until cheese is bubbling and golden, about 3 minutes.",
