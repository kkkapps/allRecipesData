    "des": "\"I was inspired to create this recipe after a major retailer stopped carrying a favorite boxed version of cilantro lime rice mix, leaving a hole in my rotation of meals. My version is budget friendly and has a fresher taste and aroma than the boxed version, and I hope others enjoy it.\"",
