    "des": "\"I first ran across this dish at Ruby Tuesday\u00c2\u00ae. It's a great change from mashed potatoes and can be just as versatile. Cream adds to the richness of the dish. Use any type of cheese you like, or leave it out to reduce calories. Many different types call for a food processor but I found my hand mixer does the job even better. Bon appetit!\"",
    "ins": "Mix cream and chicken bouillon granules together in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium until granules are soft, 20 to 30 seconds; set aside.\nPlace a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until very tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and place in a large bowl.\nMash cauliflower using a hand mixer on low speed, about 1 minute. Add cream mixture and increase speed to high; mix together until creamy, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle in shredded Cheddar cheese, seasoned salt, and garlic powder. Stir by hand until well-mixed and serve.",
