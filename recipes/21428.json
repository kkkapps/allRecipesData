I made it up, being determined not to let my mushrooms get... weird.  The best part is that it worked, and tastes great.  Keeps well in the fridge up to 3 days.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter and saute rosemary and garlic until tender.  Stir in mushrooms and saute until juices run.  Add parsley and stir occasionally to prevent sticking.  When mushrooms are tender, stir in stock and mix well before adding cornstarch.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, then add whiskey and cook for 1 minute more.",
