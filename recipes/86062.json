    "des": "\"Galatoire's Restaurant in New Orleans, La. in the French Quarter shared this recipe. It is the best we have ever tasted and I know you will enjoy it too. Decorate the edge of plate with hard-boiled eggs sliced thin or quartered, and a few green and black olives. Then stand back and let your guests give you applause for serving them such a wonderful treat.\"",
    "ins": "In the container of a food processor, combine the celery, green onions, onion and parsley. Pulse until finely chopped. Add the vinegar, ketchup, tomato puree, mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Process until well blended, stopping to scrape down the sides a couple of times. With the food processor running, drizzle the oil in a steady stream, processing until blended. Stir in paprika. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours, or overnight.\nWhen ready to serve, stir the sauce, then pour over the shrimp and toss to coat. Serve on top of lettuce leaves.",
