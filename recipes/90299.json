    "des": "\"Passed down from my grandparents, this recipe is a great way to use the extra tomato and peppers from the garden! Quick, easy and also very healthy! A nice warm lunch for the veggie lover! Makes its own sauce and can be canned for the winter months. Serve over sliced fresh buttered bread and a few shakes of salt and pepper.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the tomatoes to the water, and boil until the skin begins to split. Remove from the water, cool under cold running water, and peel off the skin.\nPlace tomatoes into a large skillet, and mash with a potato masher. Mix in the bell peppers, onion and garlic. Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes, or until onions and peppers are tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
