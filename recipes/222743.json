    "des": "\"Yes, the notorious dandelion, or taraxacum officinale has long been a nutritious supplement to salads, stir-frys, soups, condiments, and medicinally. Dent-de-Lion or Teeth of the Lion as the French say, is a plant worthy of respect being off the charts in vitamins A,B,C,D, potassium and other minerals. Below is a hearty pesto that will be the talk of the dinner party. So if you are feeling adventurous give it a try, you will not be disappointed. NOTE: Only harvest from organic gardens or untreated lawns.\"",
