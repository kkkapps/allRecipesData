    "des": "\"These pork chops are great! I accidentally left them in the marinade for a day, a night, and the next day, and they were even better! They are very tender and tasty.\"",
    "ins": "Place honey, orange juice, vinegar, wine, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, tarragon, and mustard in a large resealable plastic bag. Slash fatty edge of each chop in about three places without cutting into the meat; this will prevent the meat from curling during cooking. Place chops in the plastic bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat grill for high heat.\nLightly oil grill grate. Place chops on grill, and discard marinade. Cook chops for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once, or to desired doneness.",
