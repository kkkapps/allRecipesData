    "ins": "Butter a small cake pan.\nTo prepare Nougat:  In a frying pan place 1/2 cup of sugar over medium heat and stir.  Sugar will turn into liquid caramel.  When syrup becomes dark brown, pour into cake pan and let harden.\nCrush nougat in a mortar or between waxed paper with a hammer into small pieces.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Separate the egg and add the yolk and water.  Blend thoroughly. Stir in 1/2 cup of sifted flour and the nougat.  Mix well.  Sift in the rest of the flour.\nKnead the dough lightly on a board. Roll the dough into a 1-inch in diameter log.  Slice into 1/2-inch thick cookies. Place on greased cookie sheets 3 inches apart and press down with a fork.\nBake 10 to 12 minutes.",
