    "des": "\"My friend from St. Kitts says to skip the yeast to avoid the carbonated alcohol. He laughs at America's fascination with bubbles in their drinks. For Mel Torme I added the 'tiny bubbles'. Add flavors of your choice (vanilla, almond, bay leaves, cloves, allspice, etc.).\"",

Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy paste, about 5 minutes; stir into ginger mixture. Cover container and let sit for 3 days. Skim foam from top, strain liquid, and pour ginger beer into clean storage containers; chill.",
