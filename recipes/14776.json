    "des": "\"Fragrant with spices and rich with the  interplay of sweetly tart flavors. This simple pork dish is a perfect fall or winter meal. Serve it with a wild rice pilaf and some steamed greens. Complete the experience with a glass of Merlot. For a simple dessert serve some sliced fresh pears, sprinkle them with crumbled gorgonzola and dribble them with maple syrup.\"",
