    "des": "\"Hot Ponderosas are an interesting variation of garlic toast baguettes that work nicely for outdoor grilling and cookouts. We cooked this one up while I was living in the mountains and cooking almost all of our meals outside. Be careful - they will flame FAST, so be quick with the tongs!\"",
