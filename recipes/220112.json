    "des": "\"Boneless chicken breasts are covered in a pecan praline glaze. The Creole seasoning cuts back some of the sweetness. Dark Karo\u00c2\u00ae syrup can be used in place of the maple syrup if that's what you have.\"",

Pan-fry chicken strips until golden brown and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in brown sugar, maple syrup, pecans, and Creole seasoning. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute.\nPlace chicken strips into the prepared casserole dish; pour praline sauce over chicken and toss chicken to coat with sauce.\nBake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.",
