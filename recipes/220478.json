Remove from oven and set aside.\nPlace shrimp bouillon cubes, water, and lime juice in a large saucepan and bring to a boil.\nStir in jasmine rice, cover saucepan, and simmer over low heat until liquid has absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork.\nRemove from heat and stir in coconut milk, roasted edamame, and toasted coconut. Season to taste with salt and black pepper if desired.",
