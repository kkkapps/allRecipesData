    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the green beans, and cook until tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water until the green beans are cool. Place into a bowl along with the broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, tomatoes, and olives; set aside.\nWhisk together the vinegar, salt, pepper, monosodium glutamate, garlic salt, and dill in a bowl. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to whisk to create a dressing. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and stir to combine. Cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.",
