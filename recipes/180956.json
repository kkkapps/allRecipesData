    "des": "\"This Irish whiskey marinade is our favorite for using with flat iron steak. It adds a juicy and delicious flavor to the meat.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the olive oil, whiskey, soy sauce, green onion, garlic, pepper, parsley, thyme, and rosemary in a large, sealable plastic bag; seal and shake to mix. Add the steaks to the marinade. Seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Remove steaks from marinade; discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to come to room temperature before cooking.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCook the steaks until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Cover the meat with two layers of aluminum foil and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before serving.",
