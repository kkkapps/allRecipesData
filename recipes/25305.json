    "des": "\"This is a pasta casserole with sort of a southwestern flavor.  This is also good with canned tomatoes with green chilies, or added red pepper and garlic.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nPlace ground beef, bacon and onion  in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and place in a large saucepan along with tomatoes, soup, milk and 1/2 cup cheese.   Cook, stirring, until it comes to a low boil.\nStir in pasta, reduce heat to medium-low and cook until pasta is tender, stirring often to prevent sticking.\nTransfer to a 9x9 inch baking dish and sprinkle remaining cheese on top.\nBake in preheated oven for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.",
