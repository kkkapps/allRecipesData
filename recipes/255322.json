(Or preheat countertop induction oven on medium heat with grill pan inside.)\nBring balsamic vinegar to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until balsamic is reduced and thickened into a glaze, 10 to 15 minutes.\nPound pork cutlets with a mallet to about 1/2-inch thickness.\nCook and stir sausage, onion, and jalapeno in a skillet over medium heat until onion slightly translucent and sausage is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
