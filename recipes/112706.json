    "des": "\"This sauce began as a dare to top an ex-boyfriend's father's locally famous sauce. Something magical happens when it hits the grill! Don't forget to add to the ribs in the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, or else the high sugar content will scorch. Don't let the strong smell of vinegar scare you while cooking; the flavor of the sauce after cooking does not reflect the scent that fills the kitchen while cooking.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the poblano pepper and onion for 6 to 8 minutes, until the onion is translucent.\nStir in the honey, molasses, brown sugar, tomato paste, vinegar, Marsala wine, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, smoke flavoring, salt and pepper, and whisk until smooth. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-low heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick.\nStore refrigerated.",
