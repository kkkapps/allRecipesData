    "ins": "Heat oil in a small saucepan placed over medium-low heat.  A slice of onion should just sizzle a bit when added to the hot oil.  Add 1/2 of the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are a deep golden brown, about 7-10 minutes.  Remove with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, and salt to taste.  Onions will be soft at first and will crisp as they cool.  Repeat with remaining onions.",
