    "ins": "Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Cool bacon and crumble into pieces.\nWhisk together the mayonnaise, cider vinegar, and sugar in a mixing bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Add the broccoli, raisins, cashews, onion, and crumbled bacon. Stir until evenly coated.  Cover and refrigerate the salad for at least 2 hours. Let stand at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes before serving.",
