    "des": "\"This is the old tried and true, 1950's style tuna noodle casserole we remember as kids.  Uses ingredients most people have on hand, especially those broken chips at the bottom of the bag that nobody wants to eat.  Got to have those chips on top to be real.\"",
    "ins": "Boil pasta in lightly salted water for 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain well. Return the pasta to the pot it was cooked in.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish with cooking spray.\nMix tuna with cream of mushroom soup, cream of celery soup, milk, salt, black pepper, and garlic in a medium saucepan. Place pan over medium low heat, and heat through. Alternatively, place these ingredients in a microwave safe dish, and warm in the microwave.\nMix tuna mixture with pasta. Spread 1/2 of the noodles into the prepared dish.  Arrange the cheese slices over the noodles, then spread the remaining noodle mixture over the cheese. Top with crushed potato chips.\nBake, uncovered, for 20 to 30 minutes; cook until the casserole is hot, and the chips begin to brown. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
