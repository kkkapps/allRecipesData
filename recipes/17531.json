    "des": "\"A great summertime recipe for grilled salmon fillets. An herb and lemon marinade makes for a wonderfully light and flavorful preparation. Grilled onions would be an excellent addition!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat.\nIn a shallow glass dish, mix the olive oil, parsley, thyme, rosemary, and garlic. Place the salmon in the dish, turning coat. Squeeze lemon juice over each fillet. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nLightly oil grill grate. Transfer salmon to the grill, and discard any remaining marinade. Cook salmon on preheated grill over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning once. Fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork.",
