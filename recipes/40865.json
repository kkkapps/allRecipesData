    "ins": "In a medium bowl, whip the cream until stiff. Place a thin layer of whipped cream on the bottom of a 1 quart glass bowl, or baking dish. Dip 1/3 of the ginger biscuits into the reserved juice from the can of oranges one at a time, and place in a single layer over the whipped cream. Place about 1/3 of the mandarin orange segments in a layer over the biscuits. Repeat layers, soaking each biscuit in the juice, and ending with whipped cream on the top. Smooth the top of the dish with a palette knife or large spatula.\nRefrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to let the flavors mingle before serving.",
