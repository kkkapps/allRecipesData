    "des": "\"This is a delicious sandwich which can be served for lunch or dinner. Paired with a green salad and a glass of red wine, it makes a good meal. Any type of flat bread can be used, however I chose one topped with portobello mushrooms and gorgonzola cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Season eggplant slices with salt and pepper; let stand for 2 minutes.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute 1/2 of the eggplant until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining olive oil and eggplant.\nPreheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions.\nLayer eggplant, roasted red pepper, and mozzarella cheese, respectively, onto the bottom piece of each flat bread. Spread 1 tablespoon hummus on the inside of each top piece of flat bread and place over the mozzarella layer, creating a panini.\nGrill each panini on the preheated panini press until cooked through and cheese is melted, about 7 minutes.",
