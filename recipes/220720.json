    "ins": "Place water and butter in a large, deep skillet and bring to a boil; stir in bacon and return to a boil.\nStir cabbage into the bacon mixture; simmer until the thickest pieces of cabbage are fork-tender and the liquid has almost evaporated, about 20 minutes. Drain.\nFill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well.\nLightly toss egg noodles with bacon and cabbage; season to taste with salt and black pepper.",
