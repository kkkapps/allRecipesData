    "des": "\"This recipe came to me when I was doing a Spanish themed party for a Hemingway book. Everyone LOVED the sauce so much I try to make it all the time. However, if you don't like bleu cheese, I wouldn't try it. I also substitute whiskey for the brandy, or any liquor that isn't sweet.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter and heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Season steaks with salt and pepper, and quickly sear on both sides. Reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking steaks 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. Remove from skillet and keep warm.\nPour brandy into the skillet and stir to loosen browned bits from bottom. Stir in cream, and return to a boil. Cook and stir until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Mix cheese into the sauce until melted. Pour over the steaks to serve. Garnish steaks with parsley.",
