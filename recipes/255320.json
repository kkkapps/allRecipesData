    "des": "\"Salmon is marinated in a soy sauce-miso base, baked in a Panasonic CIO, and served alongside pureed purple potatoes and tender green beans for a quick and elegant dinner. This recipe appears on an episode of the Dinner Spinner TV Show on The CW!\"",
    "ins": "Mix soy sauce, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, miso paste, brown sugar, white wine, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl to make marinade.\nPlace salmon fillets in a shallow dish. Add enough marinade to cover, reserving the remaining marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator, about 10 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly oil a cast iron skillet or grill pan and place in the oven while it preheats. (A countertop induction oven can be used in place of the oven. Preheat on the medium-high grill setting.)\nRemove salmon from marinade, reserving the marinade, and place skin-side up on the hot cast iron skillet; cook until bottom of salmon is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip salmon and continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes more. (For the countertop induction oven, add salmon to grill pan, reserving marinade, and cook, skin-side down, for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip salmon and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.)\nPour reserved marinade into a saucepan and heat until boiling; remove from heat.\nPlace potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted cold water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot.\nHeat milk and 2 tablespoons butter together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer. Pour milk mixture over potatoes, a few tablespoons at a time, and mash using a potato masher until potatoes are desired chunkiness.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add green beans and garlic; cook and stir until beans turn bright green and are lightly browned in places, about 5 minutes; stir in 1 teaspoon butter, salt, and pepper.\nServe mashed potatoes and green beans alongside salmon. Drizzle reserved cooked marinade over the top.",
