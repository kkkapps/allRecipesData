    "ins": "In a large stock pot, layer ground beef, green beans, onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes. Finish with a layer of cabbage, then evenly drizzle soy sauce over top. Cover and cook over medium for 1 hour, or until cabbage is tender and meat is well done. Reduce heat as needed to prevent burning.\nMeanwhile, rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer under cold running water until no longer cloudy. Transfer to a medium saucepan and cover with 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes, or until all liquid has evaporated. Serve over rice.",
