    "des": "\"This recipe is so delicious.  It is essentially a sundae served on top of a grilled donut.  I created this after having it at a restaurant. This is also good with strawberry or cinnamon ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Place the cocoa powder and chocolate chips into a medium bowl. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan until simmering hot. Pour over the chocolate chips and let stand for a minute, then add vanilla and stir until smooth. Set aside.\nIn a separate bowl, stir together the confectioners' sugar and salt. Mix in vanilla and enough water to achieve a thin icing. Set aside.\nHeat the oil in a heavy skillet or electric skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Use a small biscuit cutter or knife to cut circles in the centers of the biscuits. Fry the donuts in the hot oil until browned on each side, about 4 minutes total. Drain quickly on paper towels, then transfer to a rack. Pour some of the vanilla glaze over the tops of the donuts, let it set up for about a minute, then turn them over and glaze the other side. Sprinkle the donuts with cinnamon sugar while the glaze is still wet.\nTo serve the Grillswith, place one donut in the center of a plate. Top with a scoop of ice cream. Drizzle with hot chocolate sauce.",
