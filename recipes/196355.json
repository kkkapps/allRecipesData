    "des": "\"This BBQ sauce can be used a variety of ways- we've even put it on potatoes at my house! It's sweet, tangy, and has a small kick to it. The root beer can also be substituted with Dr Pepper\u00c2\u00ae or Coca Cola\u00c2\u00ae.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the root beer, ketchup, orange juice, Worcestershire sauce, and molasses in a saucepan. Season with ginger, paprika, chipotle powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use immediately or store in the refrigerator up to a week.",
