    "des": "\"Every year 18 of us get together for our annual 'Heart Party' in honor of Valentine's Day.  Besides sharing a favorite craft, we bring 18 cookies and share a favorite recipe.  This was mine from last year.  The recipe is written using white chocolate, but you can use dark chocolate instead, or use half white and half dark. I like to decorate mine with candy sprinkles too.\"",
    "ins": "Soak craft sticks for one hour in a bowl of cold water.\nIn small heavy saucepan over very low heat, stir chocolate chips until melted and smooth.  Remove from heat; let cool.\nIn large bowl with electric mixer at medium speed, beat butter, brown sugar and vanilla until fluffy.  Beat egg in well; beat in cooled chocolate.  With mixer at low speed, beat in flour, cocoa powder and salt until smooth. Divide dough in half.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and grease 2 large cookie sheets.\nRoll each half out to 1/8 inch thickness between 2 sheets of wax paper; freeze, in wax paper, 5 minutes.  Peal top sheets of wax paper off dough; cut dough out using 3-inch heart-shaped cutter.  Reroll scraps; freeze again 5 minutes; cut out.  Place half of the hearts 1 inch apart on prepared cookie sheet.\nDrain sticks, pat dry.  Place one stick on each heart to make 2 1/2 inch handle, pressing lightly into dough.  Place remaining hearts on top; press edges gently to seal.  Bake about 12 minutes until firm to touch. Cool on wire racks.\nIn 2-quart heavy saucepan over very low heat, or in top of double boiler set over barely simmering water, stir white or milk chocolate until melted and smooth; if using both chocolates, melt in separate 1-quart pans.  Remove from heat.\nHolding each lollipop by handle, dip into chocolate to coat on both sides; let excess chocolate drip back into pan.  Place each lollipop as it is coated on wax-paper-lined cookie sheet; refrigerate 20 minutes until chocolate is set.\nTo Make Icing:  In large bowl with electric mixer at high speed, beat egg white and confectioners' sugar until very smooth.  If desired, remove small portion of icing to separate bowl; tint with drops of food coloring.  Spoon icing into decorating bag fitted with small writing tip; pipe over lollipops in desired patterns.  Decorate with assorted candies and decors; attaching with dots of icing.",
