    "des": "\"If you want something different and very pretty, try this. Layers of non-sweet cheesecake filled with colorful sliced veggies and served with a flavorful cucumber sauce. I have made this many times over the years and substituted lots of different veggies. They all work well. It's perfect for a brunch buffet, or serve with a big green salad.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nCombine cracker crumbs and butter in a large bowl to make the crust. Press into bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan.\nBeat cream cheese with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add sour cream, flour, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper; beat until blended.\nSpread 1/4 of the cream cheese mixture over crust. Sprinkle shredded carrots on top.
