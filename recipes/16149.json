    "des": "\"A wonderful marinade that makes even the toughest cuts of beef so tender you could cut them with a butter knife. Tastes great on pork chops and chicken, too. Play with the amounts of garlic and ginger to suit your taste. I tend to use more rather than less. Makes enough for four servings.\"",
    "ins": "In a small, nonporous bowl, combine the soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, mustard powder and ginger. Mix well, cover and refrigerate until ready to use on your favorite meat.",
