    "des": "\"This is a family favorite that we often had when company came for dinner. This recipe has gone home with many invited dinner guests. Mom never follows a recipe when she cooks, so this is my best guess of how she makes them! You may have to tweak things a bit, as all values for ingredients she uses are approximate. I still have not been able to replicate hers exactly!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Brown chops, turning once, and transfer to a shallow baking dish. Add water, and cover.\nBake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.\nWhen chops are almost done, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir celery and onions until onions are translucent. Stir in bread crumbs, corn, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, then spoon stuffing over chops and return to the oven. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes more, or until no longer pink in the center.",
