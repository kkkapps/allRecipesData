In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, cornstarch, mustard, cinnamon and Scotch. Brush some of the mixture onto the ham, reserve the rest for basting.\nBake in the preheated oven, basting every 20 minutes, for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let stand for 15 minutes before removing the foil and serving. This ham is delicious served warm, at room temperature or even cold.",
