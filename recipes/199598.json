    "des": "\"Quinoa is the ultimate super food.  Cook it like rice in a rice cooker or on the stove with chicken broth, soy sauce, green onions, ginger, and garlic, and you have a delicious and healthy side dish.  It goes great with chicken, fish, and seafood.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in quinoa and allow to toast for 2 to 3 minutes, then add chicken broth, soy sauce, ginger and garlic. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer  until all liquid has been absorbed, 25 to 30 minutes. Fluff quinoa with fork and top with green onions before serving.",
