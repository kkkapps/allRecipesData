    "des": "\"Tired of plain spinach pie? This recipe uses many different kinds of 'green stuff', mixed with delicious feta cheese, of course! And one little surprise: There is no phyllo dough! The recipe is a little time consuming, but totally worth it. Beware: NO LEFTOVERS! Serve with yoghurt or sour cream on the side.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x9 inch baking dish.\nBeat the eggs in a mixing bowl, then stir in the spinach, leeks, green onions, feta cheese, parsley, dill, spearmint, sugar, milk, and 3/4 cup of olive oil until evenly mixed. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and 1 pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. Stir in 1/4 cup of olive oil and the water until no lumps remain. Pour 2/3 of the batter into the prepared 9x9 inch pan, and spread out evenly. Spoon the spinach filling over the batter, then spoon the remaining batter overtop. Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese, butter pieces, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\nBake in the preheated oven until the bottom crust and top has firmed and nicely browned, about 1 hour.",
