    "ins": "Stir together flour, sugar, salt, mace, and baking powder.    Cut in butter or margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nCombine 1 tablespoon water and lemon extract and sprinkle over the mixture.  Toss gently with a fork.\nRepeat with the remaining cold water, 1 tablespoon at  a time until all is moistened.\nForm into a ball, cover and chill for about  30 minutes or until easy to handle.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F.\nDivide the dough into quarters.  Roll two of the quarters into 12 x 4-inch  rectangles and spread with the preserves.  Roll the remaining two quarters into 12 x 4-inch rectangles and carefully  place over those spread with the preserves.  Trim the edges.\nCut each rectangle into twelve 4 x 1-inch strips.    Twist each strip twice and pinch ends to seal.  Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 15 minutes.\nRemove from oven, brush with milk and sprinkle with   additional sugar.  Return to the oven and bake 5-8 minutes more or until done.  Remove and cool on wire rack.",
