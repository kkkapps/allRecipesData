    "des": "\"This was my mothers recipe, and named by my son because it is so addictive. By replacing the Jell-O\u00c2\u00ae with sugar-free Jello-O\u00c2\u00ae, using no-sugar-added pineapple, and your choice of sugar substitute, this turns into a reduced-carb recipe. If you don't have a grinder, use a blender and water to grind the cranberries, then drain.\"",
    "ins": "Process cranberries and orange in a food processor until finely ground.\nStir boiling water, sugar, and gelatin together in a bowl until gelatin and sugar dissolve. Add cranberry mixture and pineapple with juice; stir. Pour into a 8-inch square serving dish, cover the dish with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes.",
