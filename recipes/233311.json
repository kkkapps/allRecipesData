    "des": "\"This recipe uses my Powerful Flavor Pasta Meat Sauce. The beauty is in the massive amounts of mozzarella. Don't cook the mostaccioli before you add it to the final baking dish. By allowing the pasta to cook in the sauce, as opposed to water, you will see a perfect al-dente pasta infused with the flavor of the sauce.\"",
