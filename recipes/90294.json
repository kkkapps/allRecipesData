    "des": "\"The closest to my favorite satay served at my Thai restaurant. Prep is quick- best if left to marinade for a few hours or more.  Skewer up for the grill or saute on the stove! I buy the chicken tenderloin strips which are already boned, skinned and a nice size piece without slicing to save time.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, stir together the coconut milk, ground coriander, curry powder, fish sauce, and chili oil. Add the chicken breast strips, and stir to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 hours.\nPreheat an indoor or outdoor grill for high heat. Thread the chicken strips onto skewers. Discard marinade.\nGrill chicken for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until no longer pink. Time will depend on how thick your strips are. Transfer to a serving plate, and garnish with cilantro and peanuts. Serve with peanut sauce for dipping.",
