    "ins": "Toss the pork chops with the lime juice in a bowl until evenly covered. Toss with garlic and basil. Season the chops to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside to marinate for 30 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
