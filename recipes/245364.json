Lower heat to medium-low and cook until thickened, about 15 minutes.\nRemove saucepan from heat, pour mixture into a deep 9-inch cake pan, and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Cover pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate until tembleque is chilled, at least 4 hours to overnight.\nRemove tembleque from refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature, about 10 minutes. Dip bottom of pan in a bowl of warm water for 1 minute. Carefully separate tembleque from pan by running a thin knife around the edges. Place a serving dish on top of pan and invert tembleque onto dish; garnish with cinnamon.",
