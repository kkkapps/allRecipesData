    "des": "\"Wonderful use for blood oranges in the winter. Plus, the cake is moist and requires no butter and very little processed sugar. It's delicious with or without the glaze.\"",

Whisk yogurt, agave nectar, eggs, blood orange zest, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until smooth. Pour yogurt mixture into flour mixture; stir to combine. Fold olive oil into batter until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 50 minutes.\nWhisk 1/4 cup blood orange juice and turbinado sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat; simmer until sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over warm cake to absorb juice. Cool cake completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nWhisk confectioners' sugar with 2 tablespoons blood orange juice to make the glaze. Pour over cooled cake.",
