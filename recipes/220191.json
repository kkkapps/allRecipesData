    "des": "\"If you like those cinnamon waffles from the frozen food department of the grocery store, you'll love these! I developed this recipe because I don't care for syrup.  Most waffles need the sweetness of syrup to make them special. These waffles are yummy just as they are; no syrup necessary! Whipped cream and fruit are a great addition if you want to go all out or just add butter and powder sugar to the top. These may brown quicker than standard waffles because of the sugar in them, so test the first one and adjust the time. I have also added 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed; you can't taste a difference. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk flour, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl until no lumps remain.\nPour milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract into the flour mixture; stir until just combined.\nBeat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.\nFold the the beaten egg whites into the batter.\nPreheat a waffle iron and coat with cooking spray.\nPour batter onto waffle iron in batches and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes; repeat until all batter is used.",
