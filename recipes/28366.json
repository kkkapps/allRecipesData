Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 45 minutes.\nPreheat the oven broiler. Lightly grease a baking dish.\nPour marinade from the bag into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Mix in the cornstarch, and cook and stir until thickened.\nPlace chicken in the prepared baking dish. Basting frequently with the reserved 1/3 cup marinade, broil 8 minutes per side, until juices run clear. Place chicken over the cooked rice, and top with boiled marinade to serve.",
