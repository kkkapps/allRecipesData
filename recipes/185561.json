    "des": "\"I made this while camping. It was a break at camp when nobody was there, so I picked up some worms at the trading post and went off to fish down at the lake. I caught 12 bass with the help of my dad, who came down there after he played guitar at the trading post. It was 7:00 when I brought them all back to camp and thought to eat them since everyone already ate dinner while I was gone. So I fried them up in some crushed chips leftover from lunch. Yum, yum, yum.\"",

Whisk eggs and water together in a bowl; set the egg wash aside.\nSprinkle the bass fillets on both sides with Cajun seasoning and lemon pepper. Dredge the fillets in flour, and shake off any excess. Dip the fillets in the egg wash, then dip fillets in the crushed potato chips.\nFry the fish in the preheated skillet until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Serve with lemon wedges.",
