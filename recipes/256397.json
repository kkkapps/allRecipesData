    "ins": "Heat corn oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ham, onion, and green bell pepper; cook and stir until onion and green bell pepper are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in gandules, tomato sauce, sofrito, adobo seasoning, olive brine, green olives, and sazon seasoning until warmed through.\nPour water and rice into the pot; bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Cook, stirring frequently to prevent rice from sticking, until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cover; cook until rice is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove lid and stir rice; cover and cook until rice is very soft, about 30 minutes more.",
