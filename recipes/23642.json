    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nRoll out pizza dough to form a 10x16 inch sheet of dough. Cut the sheet into 3/4 inch parallel strips.  Then cut these strips in half making about 24 pieces. Tie each strip into a knot and place these knotted strips of dough close together in a greased pan.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown. Remove the knots from the oven, place them in a big bowl. While the knots are still hot, drizzle them with olive oil. Sprinkle with garlic, cheese, parsley, red pepper and salt. Toss well and serve.",
