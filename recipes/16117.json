    "des": "\"Marinated top round on French bread with onions and mushrooms, dipped in a Southwestern-style cheese sauce. Excessive and indulgent--but way, way, satisfying! Fun guest or party food.\"",
    "ins": "Place the top round and entire bottle of salad dressing in a resealable plastic bag and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.\nWhen meat is fully marinated and you're ready to prepare sandwiches, preheat oven to broil.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, saute the onions and mushrooms in the butter or margarine for 10 minutes, or until onions are tender. Set aside.\nBroil the meat for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove from oven and slice thinly against the grain. Place slices evenly on the bread and cover with the onion mixture.\nIn a microwave-safe bowl, combine the cheese, salsa and olives. Microwave for 3 to 4 minutes on high, or until the cheese is melted. Stir well and serve with the sandwiches.",
