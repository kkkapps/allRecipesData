    "des": "\"This is a hearty potato soup that tastes like a creamy baked potato. I invented it to please a picky vegetarian daughter who pronounced it 'delicious'. Garnish with chives, shredded cheese or dried dill. Serve with a bread (flour tortillas, pita bread, sourdough or cornbread) and a salad or fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Place the potatoes and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 1 hour, or until potatoes are very soft.\nMix the evaporated milk, heavy cream, sour cream, butter, onion salt, garlic powder, salt and pepper with the potatoes. Simmer 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced by 1/3.\nScoop out and drain 1 to 2 cups of the mixture and thoroughly mash with a potato masher. Return to mixture. Garnish and serve.",
