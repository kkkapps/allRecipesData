    "des": "\"This is a good way to use up some leftover Italian bread -- or any bread for that matter. Fresh mozzarella melted over vine ripe tomatoes and basil, then drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Yummy! A nice glass of red wine and you're in heaven! Enjoy with a nice salad or a cup of soup; makes a lovely lunch or afternoon snack.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Lay the 4 slices of Italian bread out on the prepared baking sheet; top each piece of bread with a tomato slice, a basil leaf, and a slice of mozzarella cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, about 7 minutes. Drizzle each sandwich with 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.",
