    "ins": "Heat milk in a large pot over medium heat until warmed and just under a boil; add parsnips and 1 teaspoon salt, cover with a lid, and cook until parsnips are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain parsnips, reserving the warm milk.\nMash parsnips, 1 cup reserved warm milk, butter, thyme, and pepper together in the pot using a hand mixer or by blending in a blender. Add more milk, salt, or pepper as desired.",
