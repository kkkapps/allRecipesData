Cook until the vegetables have given up their juice; cover and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in beef broth, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, black pepper, and chili powder.\nMix the soy sauce and cornstarch in a bowl until smooth, and pour it into the soup. Stir until the soup thickens, about 1 minute; cover the chili, and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer until the meat is very tender and the flavors have blended, about 2 hours; about 5 minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms and bean sprouts.",
