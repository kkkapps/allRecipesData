    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, heat pineapple and juice over medium heat until boiling.  Add gelatin and stir to dissolve.  Remove from heat and refrigerate until partially set.\nIn a small bowl, blend the pimento into the softened cream cheese.  Mix the gelatin mixture and cream cheese together, and then fold in the whipped cream, nuts and celery.  Pour into a 1 1/2 quart mold and chill until firm.",
