Stir in the milk, then mix in the baking powder and flour until just combined. Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about half full.\nBake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhile muffins are baking, place 1/4 cup of melted margarine in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon. Remove muffins from their cups, dip each muffin in the melted margarine, and roll in the sugar-cinnamon mixture.
