    "des": "\"I have been making this salad for years and recently traveled from NJ to Oklahoma to make a batch for one of my friends.  I have also Overnighted this salad to a friend in Dallas who simply loves it.  Of course, I pack it in dry ice.  It's fast, simple and great for a cocktail party on party rye, on toast or a bagel for breakfast, on rye with lettuce, thinly sliced onions and dill (or sweet)pickles and mayo for lunch or with pea soup and sandwich for dinner.  It's down right Yummy!!!  And make no changes to the ingredients because the salad will not taste the same.\"",
    "ins": "Process the ham in a food processor until finely chopped but not pasty, about 6 or 7 pulses. You may need to do this in batches. Place the finely chopped ham in a large bowl and continue processing the remaining ham.\nAdd the mayonnaise, onions, relish, and mustard to the processed ham. Mix well and, if the mixture is too dry, add more mayonnaise.  Refrigerate until serving. The dried onions absorb some of the moisture from the mayonnaise and relish so you may need to add more mayonnaise before serving.",
