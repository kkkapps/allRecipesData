    "des": "\"This was one of my favorite things to make when I learned to bake.  My mom made this when we were little and it was a real treat to have this as a decadent coffee cake. This is good without any topping, but I have tried a variety of things on the top: melted chocolate frosting, powdered sugar or glaze made from powdered sugar and milk.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Thoroughly grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan. Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder in a bowl until thoroughly combined.\nIn a large bowl, mix the melted margarine, sugar, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract; beat the flour mixture into the margarine mixture with an electric mixer set on Low until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top of the cake forms a crust and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Cool cake in pan on wire rack for 10 to 15 minutes before removing pan, then allow cake to cool completely.",
