    "des": "\"I used to love Toll House\u00c2\u00ae chocolate chip cookies but can no longer eat grains for health reasons. I tried many things and these are surprisingly close to good-old Toll House\u00c2\u00ae cookies, but with no grain and less sugar! These are much better than typical gluten-free cookies as they do not have the sandy texture that so often plagues gluten-free baking. If you have to be grain- or gluten-free, give these a try for an occasional naughty treat that you remember!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBeat butter and brown sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer or in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Mix eggs and vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture. Add almond flour, coconut flour, salt, and baking soda to creamed butter mixture and stir until dough is well mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Drop dough by the rounded teaspoon onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges of cookies are browned, 8 to 12 minutes.",
