    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir bacon until crispy, about 10 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMix wine, chicken, mushrooms, and bay leaf together in a large pot over medium-high heat.\nTransfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Once mixture is drained, transfer to to chicken mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and sauce is slightly thickened, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl; add butter and mix until coated.\nStir cream into chicken mixture until evenly combined. Serve chicken mixture over buttered egg noodles.",
