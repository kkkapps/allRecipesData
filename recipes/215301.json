    "des": "\"This is a sauce I created and have used for a long time. It is commonly known around here as 'My-Oh-Yeah Sauce.' It goes great with pork or beef. It works especially well poured over spare ribs and slow cooked in a slow cooker until the meat is falling off the bones. Best to par-boil or pre-bake the ribs a bit, or the fat from the ribs turns the barbecue sauce into a delicious but very thin soup. This is the first time I have actually written down this recipe. I believe the amounts to be accurate, but I do like my sauce sweet. I always say it is better to start small. You can always add easier than you can take away.\"",
