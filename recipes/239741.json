Dip eggplant into egg, allowing excess egg to drip off the eggplant; press into bread crumbs until eggplant slices are evenly coated on both sides.\nArrange coated eggplant on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.\nMix remaining 1 teaspoon salt with ricotta cheese in a bowl. Spoon ricotta cheese mixture onto each eggplant.\nBake eggplant in the oven until cheese is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.\nPlace 1 eggplant slice onto each pita chip; top with a cherry tomato and basil leaf.",
