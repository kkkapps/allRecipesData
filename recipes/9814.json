    "des": "\"No artificial ingredients. Cream cheese pastry filled with raisins, nuts and cinnamon. Naturally sweet.\"",
    "ins": "Cream together the margarine and cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer. Blend in the vanilla. Mix in the flour. Chill the dough.\nTo make the Filling: Mix together the chopped raisins, chopped walnuts, and cinnamon. If you have a food processor, place the whole walnuts and raisins into the bowl, sprinkle with the cinnamon, and chop them together by processing in short pulses.\nDivide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll out each portion into a 10 - 12 inch circle 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured board or between two sheets of waxed paper.\nSpread a light layer of preserves (approximately 2 tablespoons) onto each dough circle.  Sprinkle each circle with approximately 1/4 cup of the chopped nut-raisin-cinnamon mixture.\nCut each circle into 16 wedges using a pastry cutter or a pizza cutter. Roll each wedge from base to point. Place point down on a lightly greased or parchment lined baking sheets.\nBake for 15-17 minutes at 375 degrees F (or until golden). Remove to racks to cool.",
