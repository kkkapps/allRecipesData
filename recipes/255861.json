    "des": "\"Buckwheat is a healthy side dish containing all 9 of the essential amino acids. It's very popular in Europe. Buckwheat is gluten free, as it's not a grain. This recipe is not as quick as a plain basic way to cook buckwheat, but it's so worth it and smells and tastes so good. Serve hot with a small piece of butter on top.\"",
    "ins": "Rinse buckwheat with cold water in a colander; drain.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir buckwheat until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.\nHeat olive oil in the skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and carrot until onion is golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir for 5 minutes more.\nMelt butter in a pot over medium heat; add buckwheat and stir to coat. Add onion mixture, water, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.",
