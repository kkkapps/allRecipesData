    "des": "\"Wonderful way to blend the tastes of avocado and bacon in a warm, hearty soup. Besides the bacon bits, this soup works with a dollop of sour cream and some lime zest. Eat with plenty of crusty bread.\"",
    "ins": "In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until evenly brown. Drain, reserving 1 tablespoon grease in the skillet, chop, and set aside. Place onion and celery in the skillet, and cook until tender.\nTransfer the onion and celery to a blender or food processor. Pour in 1/2 the chicken stock, add avocados, and blend until smooth.\nTransfer blender mixture to a large pot over medium heat. Whisk in remaining stock, wine, lime juice, and heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until heated through, but do not boil. Garnish with chopped bacon to serve.",
