    "des": "\"I didn't get the char I wanted on the calamari, but I still enjoyed a flavorful, healthy lunch. The good news, however, was that I ate the leftovers cold, tossed with the same salad ingredients, and it was actually better. So, if you are planning on doing the same recipe as shown, I would suggest serving it chilled instead.\"",
    "ins": "Cut calamari tubes into 1/4-inch rings. Cut larger tentacle pieces in half. Place calamari in a bowl. Add oil, red pepper flakes, chipotle powder, cayenne pepper, brown sugar, jalapeno slices, and salt. Mix together thoroughly.\nPlace arugula and beans in separate bowl. Toss with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Divide among 4 servings bowls.\nHeat cast iron skillet over high heat until smoking. Add calamari to skillet; cook and stir until calamari loses its translucency, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat immediately.\nSpoon calamari over arugula and beans. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice. Season with a pinch of pepper flakes.",
