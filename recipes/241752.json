    "des": "\"Experimenting with shortbread cookie recipes, I found a way to create a cookie the not only gives you a melt-in-your-mouth texture, but also retains its shape and doesn't crumble when you pick it up. I ended up making these for Easter weekend to give out as gifts. So far the cookies haven't made it past the 2 hour mark after being opened and left up on a table for consumption. Hope you love these as much as my friends and family do! Enjoy!\"",
