    "des": "\"This is recipe that I modified several years ago to lower the calories and fat. Also, by using 3 medium loaf pans instead of one regular loaf pan, the bread is eaten before it dries out. I freeze the other two loaves.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 7 1/2 x 3 1/2-inch loaf pans.\nIn a large mixing bowl combine the flour, soda, salt, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. Stir well. Add applesauce, eggs, pumpkin, and water. Mix batter until well combined. Stir in nuts. Pour batter into prepared pans.\nBake until tester inserted in the center of each loaf comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.",
