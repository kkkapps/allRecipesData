    "des": "\"This is a super fast and easy recipe. One of my favorites. Even my kids love it. Though sometimes I use 1 1/2 pounds of noodles. Fettuccine can also be used. Tastes even better with fresh baked rolls or French bread and a garden salad. For the special occasion have a nice glass of red wine with it.\"",
