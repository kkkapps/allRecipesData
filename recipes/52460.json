    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine eggs, flour, salt, 1 tablespoon oil, and 1/2 cup water. Mix until smooth, then let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1/4 cup oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion slices until golden brown; set aside. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place 1/3 of the dough into a spaetzle maker or coarse sieve or collander with holes about 4 millimeters in diameter. Let dough drop into boiling water. Boil until spaetzle rises to the top, then transfer to a 9 inch casserole dish with a slotted spoon. Cover with 1/3 of the cheese. Repeat layers with remaining spaetzle and cheese. Spoon fried onions over top.\nBake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese is thoroughly melted. Before serving, sprinkle with 1 or 2 tablespoons vinegar, and sprinkle with chopped parsley.",
