    "des": "\"Do not marinate the shrimp longer than the indicated time. If you are using bamboo skewers, be sure to soak them in cold water for at least 30 minutes. I serve these with an orzo salad and grilled zucchini and squash.\"",
    "ins": "Combine mint leaves, sugar, and shallot in a bowl; pound with a spoon to crush coarsely. Whisk rum and 1/4 cup lime juice into mint mixture to make a marinade. Stir lime zest into the marinade; season with salt and black pepper.\nPour marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add the shrimp, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove shrimp from marinade and thread onto 6 bamboo or metal skewers, all facing the same way. Discard marinade.\nCook the skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently until nicely browned on all sides, and the meat is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Drizzle 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice over the skewers to serve.",
