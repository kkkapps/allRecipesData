    "des": "\"If desired serve with rice or noodles, pouring sauce from chicken over each serving. You can also cut down on calories by not dredging the chicken but just browning it in a roast pan (using cooking spray) on top of the stove, then adding the remaining ingredients as directed and roasting in the oven. It's good either way!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).\nDredge chicken wings in flour and brown slowly in butter or margarine over medium heat. Place browned chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nAdd the onion, orange juice, ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, ground ginger and garlic powder/salt to the frying pan. Bring to a boil. Pour mixture over chicken and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn chicken and continue baking for 30 additional minutes or until very tender.",
