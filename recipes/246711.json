    "des": "\"Bhindi Subzi is okra cooked with onions and tomatoes. Simple to cook but often misunderstood. \nMy husband was not a big fan of okra but devoured and raved about this dish! Mission accomplished! Serve with roti, naan, or a wrap.\"",
    "ins": "Heat mustard oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add okra, garlic, and cumin seeds; cook and stir until okra is no longer sticky, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onions and ginger; cook until onions soften slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in turmeric powder; cook for about 30 seconds. Stir in garam masala; cook for about 30 seconds.\nStir tomatoes and amchoor powder into the skillet. Cook until tomatoes start to soften, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and cover. Let rest until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and garnish with cilantro.",
