    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nHeat non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add roast beef hash, onions, and chili garlic sauce; cook and stir to break up the hash and until onions soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in 5 beaten eggs and cook, stirring constantly, until eggs just begin to set but are still very loose. Remove skillet from heat. Stir in cilantro and tomatoes.\nLightly flour a work surface. Roll out each empanada wrapper into a 6-inch circle. Scoop 1/3 cup hash filling onto center of each wrapper. Fold each wrapper in half to enclose the filling; crimp edges with times of a fork to seal. Cut 2 half-inch slits on top of each empanada. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.\nWhisk 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons water to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over the tops of the empanadas.\nBake in preheated oven on middle rack until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve with picante sauce for dipping.",
