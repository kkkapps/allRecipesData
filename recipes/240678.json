I opted for a simplified version that tasted a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch and was strong enough to slightly inebriate something larger than a house elf. Great for Harry Potter-themed parties or Halloween. Served super-chilled in a frosted mug, it can magically warm up even the coldest wizards.\"",
    "ins": "Stir rum and butterscotch schnapps together in a frosted 14-ounce mug.\nPour butter flavoring into the cream soda, then turn cream soda over to pour quickly into the chilled mug. Gently drop the ice cream into the soda mixture.",
