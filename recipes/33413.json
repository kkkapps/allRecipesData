    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nArrange the tomato slices on the prepared baking sheet. Top each slice with ricotta cheese; sprinkle the Italian seasoning over the ricotta cheese; place under the preheated broiler until the cheese begins to brown, about 5 minutes.\nSpread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise on each of 2 slices of toasted multigrain bread. Top the remaining two pieces of toast with the slices of provolone cheese. Then arrange the broiled tomatoes on the provolone cheese. Complete the sandwich by placing the bread with the mayonnaise atop the tomatoes.",
