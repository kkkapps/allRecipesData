    "des": "\"This Fuzzy Beach Balls recipe was dreamed up prior to our annual beach trip in August 2015. We wanted something fun and unique. The alcohol-infused melon balls (aka Spiked Balls) adds a fun kick and is the signature ingredient of this drink. Everyone loved it, some a bit too much! We're including both the batch and individual recipes below. Release your inner beach! Enjoy and share with friends.\"",
    "ins": "Place cantaloupe balls in a small bowl. Pour in enough grain alcohol to cover them halfway. Let infuse, turning occasionally, 4 hours to overnight.\nFill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add pineapple juice, orange juice, raspberry vodka, and coconut rum. Cover and shake until outside of the shaker is frosted. Strain into a glass. Add spiked cantaloupe balls and grenadine syrup.",
