    "des": "\"A great autumn recipe! Pork loin is roasted over a bed of seasoned sauerkraut. I serve this with baked potato and  butternut squash. Other seasonings can be added to the kraut mixture, such as thyme or caraway seed.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season pork roast with salt and black pepper. Brown the pork in the hot oil, about 5 minutes per side.\nMix sauerkraut, cream of mushroom soup, onion, apple, cranberries, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Spoon the mixture into a baking dish and place the pork roast on top of the sauerkraut mixture.\nRoast in the preheated oven until the meat juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour. Remove roast and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving with sauerkraut.",
