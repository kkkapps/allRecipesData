    "des": "\"I created this dessert because I still had tons of rhubarb hanging around in my freezer and I was sick of the go-to strawberry/rhubarb combination. It turned out amazingly! The tart taste of rhubarb is, not surprisingly, complemented by blueberry. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nWhisk brown sugar, white sugar, 1/4 cup oats, 1 teaspoon flour, and a pinch of cinnamon together in a bowl. Add rhubarb and blueberries; stir to coat. Pour mixture into a small baking dish.\nStir 1/2 cup flour, 1/3 cup oats, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl; add enough butter to create a crumbly topping, about 1/2 of the butter. Sprinkle crumbly topping over rhubarb mixture, and drizzle remaining butter over the top.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
