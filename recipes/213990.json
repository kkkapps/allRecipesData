Strain the mixture and set aside.\nCombine the agar-agar powder and water in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until the powder is completely dissolved. Whisk the sugar into the mixture until dissolved, but do not bring to a boil. Stir the custard into the mixture allow to cook for about 2 minutes. Pour the mixture into 1-cup molds.
