    "des": "\"A chocolate-painted baked pie crust prevents this pie from getting soggy and adds a wonderful flavor complementing the strawberries! Serve with whipped cream. I am adding blueberries just around the inner edge of the pie crust after the filling has been added to create a nice red, white, and blue theme for our 4th of July celebration!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Press pie crust pastry into a 1/2-inch deep dish pie plate. Prick bottom and sides of pastry with fork.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.\nMelt chocolate chips in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, 1 to 3 minutes. Paint melted chocolate in the bottom and inside of cooled pie crust. Place chocolate-painted crust in freezer to harden the chocolate, about 30 minutes.\nPlace the prettiest strawberry, cut-side down, in the center of the chocolate crust. Arrange as many attractive strawberries as possible around the center strawberry, so they appear as circles around the center.\nMash the remaining strawberries in a bowl; transfer to a saucepan. Add sugar and lemon juice; bring to a boil, stirring frequently.\nWhisk ginger ale and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; gradually stir into boiling strawberry mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for about 5 minutes.\nSpoon strawberry sauce over strawberries in pie shell. Chill in refrigerator until pie is set, at least 8 hours.",
