    "des": "\"This is my own little recipe for fried chicken. With it's double-batter crunch and the blend of seasonings, this chicken is delish. Fried in cast iron with peanut oil, this is sure to be a family dinner fave.\"",
    "ins": "Heat peanut oil in a deep, heavy skillet over medium heat or a deep-fryer.\nMix flour, onion powder, and paprika together in shallow bowl. Whisk milk and egg together in a separate shallow bowl.\nDip chicken pieces in flour mixture until evenly coated, shaking off excess. Dip coated chicken in the milk mixture, allowing excess to drip back into bowl; roll again in the flour mixture until coated.\nWorking in batches, place chicken in the hot oil and cover skillet; cook until chicken is browned and no longer pink and the center, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
