    "des": "\"This is an easy and authentic version of Korean tofu stew. I used to eat this every day at a very popular restaurant. I befriended a woman who worked there and she gave me the recipe. It's very versatile. Small pieces of meat or seafood can be added. It's thick and great in the winter and can be made very mild or very spicy. I've seen some recipes on the internet for this dish that are the American version. They may be good too but this one is authentic.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the Korean chile powder and ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Stir in the soy bean paste, coating the beef. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Gently drop tofu into the soup and continue cooking until the tofu is heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and quickly add the egg into the soup, stirring gently to break it up. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onion.",
