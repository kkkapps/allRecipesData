    "des": "\"This tangy and flavorful dressing has a smooth 'zip' to it because of nutritional yeast and garlic powder. It's a great dressing for salads of any kind. It works great as a dipping sauce as well. Anyone who is looking for something different will definitely enjoy this dressing. The best part is that it takes only minutes to make. Vegetarians will love it for its protein packed, light, clean taste.\"",
