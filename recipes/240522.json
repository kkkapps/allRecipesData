    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).\nBeat butter and garlic together in a bowl. Poke several holes in roast with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over roast and season meat with salt and black pepper. Place roast, fat-side up, in a roasting pan.\nRoast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue cooking until roast is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
