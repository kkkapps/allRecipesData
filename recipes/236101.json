Third rule of beer batter: You DO NOT need to sift the flour and don't over-whisk it. A few lumps actually makes for a better texture. Fourth and most important rule of beer batter: It is important to choose the correct beer according to what you are going to cook. As any ingredient ranges in texture and taste, so does beer.\"",
