    "des": "\"Vegetarian red wine sauce. You can use your own homemade veggie broth or canned broth. Be aware of the salt content of packaged broth, however, if you need to keep your salt consumption low. For more of a cream sauce, you can use soy or almond milk instead of veggie broth. You can substitute 1 large onion for the shallots, if desired. You can use butter in place of coconut oil, if desired. You can substitute cornstarch in place of flour, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Melt coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute shallots in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat, cool slightly, and stir in flour until no lumps remain.\nReturn shallot mixture to medium-high heat; slowly whisk in red wine and vegetable stock. Cook, stirring constantly, until liquid thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in balsamic vinegar and mustard. Season with thyme leaves, salt, and black pepper.",
