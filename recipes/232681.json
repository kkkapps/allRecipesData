    "des": "\"Char siu literally means fork burn/roast-'Char' being fork (both noun and verb) and siu being burn/roast-after the traditional cooking method for the dish: long strips of seasoned boneless pork are skewered with long forks and placed in a covered oven or over a fire. This is best cooked over charcoal, but importantly to cook with indirect heat.\"",
    "ins": "Cut pork with the grain into strips 1 1/2- to 2-inches long; put into a large resealable plastic bag.\nStir soy sauce, honey, ketchup, brown sugar, rice wine, hoisin sauce, red food coloring, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until just combined and slightly warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the marinade into the bag with the pork, squeeze air from the bag, and seal. Turn bag a few times to coat all pork pieces in marinade.\nMarinate pork in refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove pork from marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade.\nCook pork on preheated grill for 20 minutes. Put a small container of water onto the grill and continue cooking, turning the pork regularly, until cooked through, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
