    "des": "\"Brining pork chops is like upgrading to premium cable; once you do it, you can't go back to basic. Dissolve salt and molasses in water, toss in the chops, and wait. What do you get from such little effort? A pork chop that's seasoned from the inside out, with a firm, but very moist texture.\"",
    "ins": "Combine salt, molasses, cloves, and boiling water in a large container. Stir until molasses and salt are dissolved; let cool to room temperature.\nPour cold water into molasses mixture; stir to combine.\nCompletely submerge pork chops in molasses mixture. Cover container and refrigerate for 6 hours.\nRemove pork chops from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Lightly oil each chop.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nPlace pork chops on the hottest part of the grill; cook each side until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium-high area of the grill and cook pork until it is slightly pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
