    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease cookie sheets.\nUsing a pastry blender or food processor, cut butter into cream cheese.\nIn a small bowl, sift dry ingredients together except for confectioners' sugar.\nWork dry ingredients into butter/cream cheese mixture until you have an even, mealy texture.\nKnead to form a stiff dough. If the dough gets too soft, refrigerate for about five minutes before continuing.\nRoll dough to 1/4-inch thickness.\nUsing a cookie cutter or glass, cut into about 3 inch diameter cookies.  Keep re-rolling dough until you have used it all.  Use your thumb to make a depression in each cookie. Place a 1/2 teaspoon of filling in the depression.\nBake for about 20 minutes (until lightly golden).   Let cool on a cookie rack.  Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar.  Store in an airtight container",
