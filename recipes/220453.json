    "des": "\"A recipe handed down by my grandmother Anna Marie McNamara (nee Player). This is a great recipe for a light tea dessert bread. Delicious with light butter hot out of the oven. You can use any type of milk. I usually make this bread when my milk is about to go sour. I like to use raw crystallized sugar in place of the white granulated sugar. My father likes to use buttermilk.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGrease an 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pan.\nMix flour, baking powder, baking soda, 9 tablespoons sugar, and salt in the mixing bowl of a large stand mixer on low speed until combined.\nMix in butter until thoroughly combined.\nBeat in milk, then eggs, then raisins, incorporating each ingredient well before adding the next.\nTransfer dough to the prepared loaf pan and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar.\nBake in the preheated oven until bread has risen and the top is golden brown, about 45 minutes. A toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center should come out clean.\nCool for about 10 minutes before slicing. Best served warm.",
