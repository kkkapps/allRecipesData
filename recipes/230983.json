    "des": "\"Delicious variation of this favorite deli salad. Honey is absorbed more slowly than cane sugar, so this may be better tolerated by those who are more sensitive to 'sugar highs.'  Also, for those who find white or red onions just too strong of a flavor, I've used green onion for a milder yet still 'onion-y' layer.\"",
    "ins": "Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on a plate lined with paper towel.\nToss broccoli, cranberries, and green onion together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, honey, and vinegar together in a small bowl. Add bacon to broccoli mixture and toss. Drizzle dressing over the salad; toss to coat.\nRefrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.",
