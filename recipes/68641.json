    "ins": "Place sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly until evenly browned. Drain grease, and set aside.\nSpread bread pieces in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle melted butter over the bread pieces, then sprinkle in the cooked sausage. Cover with shredded cheese. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, white wine, Dijon mustard, and green onions. Season with black and red pepper. Pour the egg mixture over everything in the baking dish. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.\nRemove the dish from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to baking to allow it to come to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nCover the dish with aluminum foil, and bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Then uncover, and bake for an additional 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, and spread sour cream over the top. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Return to the oven for an additional 10 minutes, or until cheese is starting to brown slightly.",
