    "ins": "In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. In the drippings, saute onion and garlic until tender Stir in the chicken, potatoes and oil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the potatoes and chicken are tender, stirring once. Stir in peas, corn, parsley, salt and pepper. Make four wells in the hash; bread an egg into each well.
