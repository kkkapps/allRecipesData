    "des": "\"Broiling the tomatillos gives this salsa a subtly smoky taste. If you are sensitive to spicy food, remove the seeds from the peppers. This salsa is perfect as both a dip for taco chips and to top enchiladas suizas.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Place tomatillos cut side down on a baking sheet.\nBroil in preheated oven until slightly charred, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer tomatillos to a food processor with cilantro, onion, jalapeno pepper, serrano pepper, lime juice, and sugar; pulse until well mixed.",
