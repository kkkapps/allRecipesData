    "des": "\"These are great for crepes. My family loves them with Nutella\u00c2\u00ae and strawberries. \nThese are also great to pour into shapes: shark, bear, snowman, etc. I like to double this recipe and use the batter for a couple days.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk almond milk, vinegar, and lemon juice together in a bowl; set aside for 10 minutes.\nMix rice flour, potato starch, arrowroot flour, tapioca flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt together in a bowl. Stir coconut oil into flour mixture using a fork until evenly combined. Stir eggs into flour mixture.\nWhisk milk mixture into flour mixture until batter is thoroughly mixed.\nHeat a lightly oiled skillet or large pan over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet and immediately rotate the skillet until the batter evenly coats the bottom in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen; flip crepe and cook until the other side has turned light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
