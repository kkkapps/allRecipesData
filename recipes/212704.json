    "des": "\"This is a wonderful semi-homemade stuffing with lots of flavor and textures.  I made this for Thanksgiving and I got a lot of compliments and it was all gone within minutes. Use 2 boxes of chicken broth if you like it moist, 1 box if you like it dry.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nHeat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, yellow onion, celery, green onion, and pear. Cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Place the stuffing mix into a large mixing bowl; stir in the vegetable mixture, parsley, and chicken broth. Stir until the chicken broth has been absorbed by the stuffing mix; spoon into the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.",
