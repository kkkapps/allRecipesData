    "des": "\"This hummus recipe was handed down to me by my Syrian grandmother. I took it and tweaked it just a touch, adding roasted garlic, making it my most-requested recipe. I finally made it for my grandma a few months ago and she said it was incredible. That was my Oscar moment :) Even people who don't like hummus love this recipe. And I'm modest too!\"",

Drizzle cloves with 1 tablespoon of olive oil; wrap in foil.  Roast in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from the oven, and allow to cool. When slightly cooled, squeeze roasted garlic out of peels.\nCombine roasted garlic, garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, salt, and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the work bowl of a food processor.
