    "ins": "Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add eggs, and cook for 3 minutes. The yolks need to be runny. While the eggs cook, crush the crackers into two coffee mugs with the butter. When the eggs are done, remove from the water, and peel. Place one soft-boiled egg into each cup. Mix into the crackers, and season with salt and pepper.",
