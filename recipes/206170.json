I recommend freezing these in ice trays, then storing in freezer bags and frozen to have on hand. You can double, triple or quadruple, etc as needed. This recipe lasts me about 2 months.\"",
    "ins": "Place the garlic, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, green chile peppers, and onions into a food processor, and process to a coarse puree. Spoon the sofrito into ice cube trays and freeze. Once the cubes are solidly frozen, transfer them to a resealable freezer bag. Keep frozen for use as needed.",
