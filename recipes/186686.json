    "ins": "Bring the rice and 3 1/2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cover; simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.\nWhile the rice is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Once the oil is hot, stir in the chicken, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the onions, and cook until the onions have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes more. Pour in the chicken stock, dried apricots, and apricot preserves.\nBring the mixture to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of water, and stir into the simmering chicken mixture. Cook until the sauce has thickened and cleared, about 1 minute. Serve the apricot chicken over rice.",
