    "ins": "Beat egg whites. Add sifted powdered sugar and beaten egg yolks.  Beat for 15 minutes (!)\nSift cake flour with baking powder and  salt.\nWhen you roll them out, use just enough flour to roll easily.  Roll lightly to 1/4 or 1/2 inch thickness and press design into dough with a well-floured 'Springerle' rolling pin - but don't go all the way through the dough.  (The rolling pin has designs cut into it. They sell them in specialty stores.)\nButter a cookie sheet and then sprinkle it with anise seed.   Cut each section apart carefully and transfer the cookies to the sheet.\nLet stand overnight to set the design.  Otherwise, they sort of melt into themselves.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).\nBake for 15 minutes.  Do not brown.  Springerles are hard at first, but if you store them in a bread box they become tender.",
