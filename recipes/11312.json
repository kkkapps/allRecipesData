Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the oats, white chocolate, and macadamia nuts until evenly distributed. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are toasted. For crisper cookies, bake longer.
