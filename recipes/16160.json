    "des": "\"This is the recipe that my friends and family still beg me to make when the grill is brought out. It's so easy and versatile, and can be tried on several different meats. I like it with scalloped potatoes, baked potatoes or rice pilaf. Try it with cilantro or oregano instead of parsley. Save leftovers for salad the next day.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.\nDip chicken in lemon juice, and sprinkle with the onion powder, ground black pepper, seasoning salt and parsley. Discard any remaining lemon juice.\nCook on the prepared grill 10 to 15 minutes per side, or until no longer pink and juices run clear.",
