    "des": "\"This marinade is great for grilled salmon. It works well with any cut of salmon. However, I typically use salmon fillets. I like king salmon best, but it works well on any type of fresh salmon. This marinade is enough for 3 pounds of salmon.\"",
    "ins": "Make a shallow pan from a double layer of aluminum foil. Place foil pan in a large baking sheet.\nArrange salmon fillets in the prepared foil pan, skin-side down. Stir basil, honey, lemon, oil, soy sauce, shallot, Worcestershire sauce, and ginger together in a bowl; pour over salmon. Let salmon marinate for 30 minutes to 2 hours.\nPreheat grill for medium-low heat.\nSlide salmon in the foil pan off the baking sheet onto the preheated grill. Cover grill.\nCook until salmon is easily flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes.",
