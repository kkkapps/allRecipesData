    "des": "\"Super easy recipe that everyone can enjoy including vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, kids, and everyone else! The tapioca helps bind everything together and makes for a wholesome nutritious snack that tastes great! These are incredibly nutritious with the only oil coming from the pan and whatever might be in the seeds. They go great with dips or a strong base for appetizers.\"",
