    "des": "\"A moist bread with different spices than standard zucchini bread recipes. This is the best one I've tried, thanks to my stepmom-in-law. I like to freeze the shredded zucchini, and make this in the fall and winter. It's wonderful to serve at the Thanksgiving table.\"",

Add grated zucchini.\nIn a separate bowl sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ground ginger, and ground cloves.\nBlend dry ingredients into zucchini mixture. Pour into two 8x5 loaf pans coated with cooking spray.\nBake in a 325 degree F (165 degrees C) oven for one hour. Cool for 10 minutes and remove from pans. Cool on a wire rack.",
