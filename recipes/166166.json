    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 30 minutes. Drain and allow cool, then peel and dice. Place the diced potatoes into a large mixing bowl and refrigerate until cold. Once cold, fold in the mayonnaise, celery, eggs, chicken, mustard, olives, salt, and pickles. Refrigerate 2 hours before serving.",
