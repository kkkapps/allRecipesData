    "des": "\"Australia's famous Lamingtons are squares of sponge cake that are first dipped in chocolate glaze and then in coconut.  This cookie version's inside is denser and loaded with toasted almonds.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease 10 X 15 inch jelly roll pan. Place a 22 inch length of waxed paper lengthwise in pan.  Smooth paper so it conforms to pan, allowing excess to hang over ends of pan.  Butter the waxed paper.\nIn a medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt, set aside.\nIn a large mixing bowl, beat butter, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.\nStir in flour mixture 1/2 cup at a time, blending well after each addition.  Stir in chopped nuts.  Spread evenly in prepared pan.\nBake 10 - 15 minutes, or just until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Holding ends of waxed paper, lift cookie base out of pan and place on rack. Cool.\nTo prepare Glaze: In a large bowl, whisk together powered sugar and cocoa until no lumps remain.  Add vanilla and 4 tablespoons milk. Add enough of the remaining milk to make a smooth, creamy glaze of medium consistency.\nLine a large baking sheet with waxed paper.  Place coconut on a large plate.  Cut cookie base in 48 (1 1/4 X 2 1/2 inch) strips.\nUse a fork to spear cookie rectangles; dip into chocolate glaze, allowing excess to drip back into bowl.  Place  chocolate dipped cookie on plate of coconut; use 2 forks to turn cookie so that all sides are coated.  Place on prepared baking sheet and refrigerate until glaze is set.  Store in airtight container at room temperature one week; freeze for longer storage.",
