    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch pie dish with butter.\nPress one pie crust into the prepared pie dish.\nMix sugar, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, cardamom, and allspice together in a bowl. Slowly stir butter into the sugar mixture until fully incorporated.\nToss peaches and rum together in a separate bowl; add sugar mixture to peaches. Gently toss to coat peaches. Pour peach mixture into pie crust. Top with remaining pie crust; seal the two crust edges together. Cut 4 to 5 slits in the top crust for ventilation. Brush with milk.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake until top is golden brown, about 30 more minutes. Turn off the oven and let the pie rest in the oven as it cools, at least 1 hour.",
