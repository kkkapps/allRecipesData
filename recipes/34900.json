    "des": "\"My mom bugged grandpa for this recipe but he told her he didn't have one.  So, when he made the bread one day she captured each ingredient in a bowl and measured it and put it in the bowl he planned to mix it in!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cast iron skillet.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda and sugar. Toss the raisins with the flour mixture until coated. Make a well in the center and add the egg, buttermilk, and melted margarine. Stir until all of the dry ingredients are absorbed. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for a few quick turns just to even out the dough. Handle the dough as little as possible. Pat into a flat circle, and place into the prepared pan.\nBake the bread for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are golden.",
