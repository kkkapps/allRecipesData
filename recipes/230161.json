    "des": "\"If you don't cook fish often, or don't like fish, this broiled red snapper recipe may be just what the doctor ordered. Normally we don't want to cover up the delicate flavors of the seafood, but in this case, we have no choice. It's not like you can't tell you're eating fish, but close enough.\"",
    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly coat with cooking spray.\nCombine mayonnaise, lemon juice, and barbeque sauce in a bowl.\nPlace red snapper fillets on the prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Spread half the mayonnaise mixture over the top of each fillet and sprinkle with cayenne pepper.\nCook under the preheated broil until top is browned and bubbling and fish flakes easily with a fork, rotating the baking sheet if necessary, about 7 minutes.",
