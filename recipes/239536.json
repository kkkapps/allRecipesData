    "des": "\"A wonderful side dish to ramp up plain buttered egg noodles. We love it with Salisbury steak, chicken, or pork.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and return noodles to pot.\nWhile the noodles boil, melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in melted butter until lightly browned and soft, about 8 minutes. Stir baby spinach into the onion mixture; saute until the spinach is just barely wilted, about 2 minutes.\nStir spinach mixture into the noodles; season with salt and pepper.",
