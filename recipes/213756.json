    "ins": "Place the avocados and melted butter in a mixing bowl.  Blend with an immersion blender until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape the mixture into a saucepan and stir over low heat.\nPour in the Irish cream and stir. Add the cocoa powder and stir until completely incorporated.  Stir in the confectioners' sugar 1 cup at a time, making sure the sugar is completely incorporated and the mixture is smooth before adding the next cup.\nMelt the semi-sweet chocolate and white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).  Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Pour the melted chocolate into the sauce pan and mix thoroughly. Remove from the heat.\nLine a 9X11-inch pan with wax paper or foil sprayed with cooking spray.  Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared pan.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.",
