    "ins": "Put bread crumbs into a shallow dish.\nGently press tilapia fillets into bread crumbs to coat. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded tilapia onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.\nCook tilapia in hot oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer cooked fillets to a plate.\nTop each fillet with salsa; cook in microwave to get the salsa hot, about 15 seconds.",
