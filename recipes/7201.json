    "des": "\"This is a yummy variation of Amish Friendship Bread.  It's one of my family's favorites! It's versatile enough to make muffins, too. Just add 3 tablespoons of the batter into greased muffin tins and reduce the baking time to 23-25 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "In a large mixing bowl blend together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, poppy seeds, and lemon pudding mix. Make a well in the center of the bowl.\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the Amish starter, eggs, milk, applesauce, vanilla, and vegetable oil. Add to dry ingredients and blend until just combined. Pour batter into 2 greased loaf pans.\nBake in a preheated 325 degree F(165 degrees C) oven for one hour. Cool for 10 minutes on  a wire rack. Remove bread from pan.",
