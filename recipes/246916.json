    "des": "\"This is a stew-like Japanese-style curry that don't use a curry or roux block. \nSince my relative grows a huge amount of summer veggies every year, I came up with this recipe!\n My husband and his co-workers really adore this curry so much that he hates roux-based curry now.\n You only need one nonstick pot to make this, so clean-up is easy! To serve Japanese-style, serve in a deep plate next to a scoop of rice. You can also this with pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large nonstick pot over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add ground chicken; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes.\nStir flour and curry powder into the pot, mixing until well-blended with the chicken. Add pumpkin, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and carrot. Stir in water, chicken broth powder, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce; mix until curry is well-combined.\nCover pot. Reduce heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry is thick and stew-like, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.",
