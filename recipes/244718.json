    "des": "\"I had this idea for a sweet breakfast pizza topped with fruit and yogurt, but I really wanted to do something more 'cool' with the idea. I incorporated zucchini into the sweet crust and it tastes exactly like zucchini bread only in a different form! With the sweet toppings, this pizza is the perfect alternative to your morning slice of quick bread!\"",

Add zucchini, egg, 1 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup, and vanilla extract and mix well. Spread zucchini mixture into the form of a pizza crust on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until zucchini \"crust\" is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Cool \"crust\".\nSpread yogurt onto zucchini \"crust\" and top with strawberries, grapes, banana, orange zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.",
