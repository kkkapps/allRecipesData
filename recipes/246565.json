    "des": "\"Red lentils and brown rice make for a thick vegetarian soup that's full of fiber, filling you up quickly. I came up with this when I only had a few ingredients to work with while in the mood for lentil soup. Top with Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in broth, diced tomatoes, red lentils, brown rice, Italian seasoning, celery flakes, white pepper, and marjoram. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until lentils break down and rice is tender, about 55 minutes.\nStir balsamic vinegar into the soup just before serving.",
