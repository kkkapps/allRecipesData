Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour to overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCook the steaks until they are browned on the outside and red in the center, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Slice the steak thinly across the grain before serving.",
