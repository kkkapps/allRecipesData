    "des": "\"This cookie gets its name from the West Coast Trail on Vancouver Island. It's my adaptation of the perfect nut-free trail cookie that's been our family's favorite chewy oatmeal cookie for 10 years. Loaded with choco-chips and dried cranberries. The flax seed meal and pumpkin seeds give them a nutty taste, without the nuts. Perfect for school kids or those with allergies.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nWhisk together all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, flax seed meal, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.\nBeat together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl until smooth and creamy; Stir in eggs and vanilla. Stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until dough is just combined. Fold oats, chocolate chips, cranberries, coconut, and pumpkin seeds into dough just until evenly combined.\nShape dough into 1 1/2-inch balls or drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets about 2 inches apart; press to flatten slightly.\nBake cookies in the preheated oven until lightly golden at the edges, about 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
