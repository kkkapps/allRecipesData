Place in a roasting pan.\nRoast for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. In a small bowl, mix together the maple syrup, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard and mustard powder.\nWhen the 30 minutes are up, brush 1/3 of the glaze over the ham. Bake 20 minutes, and repeat twice with remaining glaze. Let the ham stand for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.",
