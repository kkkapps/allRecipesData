    "des": "\"Savory, salty, and tangy, this cornbread is great for breakfast, lunch, or a snack. The recipe is a mashup of Bulgarian banitsa and Bosnian razljevak. Serve warm, topped with plain yogurt or eat it by its lonesome self. If you love sweet cornbread, this probably isn't your cup of tea.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter 9x13-inch baking pan; sprinkle 2 tablespoons cornmeal on bottom.\nSift all-purpose flour, semolina flour, 1/2 cup cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk spinach, buttermilk, feta cheese, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a separate large bowl. Stir flour mixture into spinach mixture just until pourable batter forms. Pour batter into prepared baking pan.\nBake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.",
