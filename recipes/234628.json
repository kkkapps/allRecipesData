    "des": "\"A skillet version of classic fruit crisp, healthy enough for breakfast! We love to eat this for breakfast in the summer and fall when fruit is abundant. It is a nice alternative to oatmeal if you want to avoid milk. You can substitute butter for coconut oil use different types of fruit: apples, peaches, plums, or nectarines, peeled or unpeeled. Add apple juice if oats are not yet complete and mixture begins to dry out.\"",
    "ins": "Stir oats, almonds, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Mix 1/2 cup coconut oil into oat mixture until crumbly.\nHeat remaining 2 tablespoons coconut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir apples in hot oil until crisp and tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Mix honey and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon into apples.\nPour oat mixture into skillet with apple mixture, lower heat to medium, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until oats are cooked and tender, 10 to 15 minutes.",
