    "des": "\"Browning the butter really adds a depth of flavor, not to mention it smells extra amazing when in the oven. This is my go-to recipe when I have ripe bananas, and has taken me a while to get it right. Enjoy it hot, fresh from the oven.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a low simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until butter is browned, fragrant, and foamy, with brown bits in it, 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Measure 1/3 cup of browned butter; reserve remaining browned butter for another use.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.\nMash bananas in a large bowl; stir in brown sugar, white sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and 1/3 cup brown butter.\nWhisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Fold flour mixture into banana mixture just until all ingredients are moistened; pour into prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.",
