    "des": "\"Moist and delicious, I came up with this recipe for my young vegetarian daughter because it is high in protein, fiber, vitamins, and good fats. It has been a hit with everybody who's tried it. Makes a great breakfast, after-school snack, or addition to a kids lunch. These muffins will be moist in the middle.\"",

Line 24 muffin cups with paper muffin liners.\nSpread quinoa onto a baking sheet and toast in preheating oven until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\nPour toasted quinoa into a blender and pulse until the quinoa has the consistency of cornmeal.\nStir ground quinoa, pumpkin puree, milk, water, whole wheat flour, flaxseed meal, egg, honey, coconut oil, walnut oil, chia seeds, cinnamon, baking powder, ground ginger, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until smooth.
