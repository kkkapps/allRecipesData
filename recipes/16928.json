    "des": "\"I was inspired to create this recipe after sampling the most delicious rib-eye steak at a local Mexican restaurant. My family is crazy for this dish! You can also bake this in the oven on low heat or even in a slow cooker.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Sear the steaks on both sides and set aside. In the same skillet over medium heat, saute the red bell pepper, green bell pepper, onion and garlic for 5 minutes, or to desired tenderness.\nSprinkle the steaks with the fajita seasoning and place them back in the skillet. Squeeze the lime juice over the steaks and bell peppers, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning steaks over occasionally. (Note: The longer it simmers, the more tender the meat gets.)",
