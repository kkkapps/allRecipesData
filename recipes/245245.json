    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-inch square baking dish with Reynolds Wrap\u00c2\u00ae Aluminum Foil. Grease the foil and set aside.\nHeat the olive oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the sweet potatoes and Italian sausage. Stir to coat. Cook for a few minutes until starting to brown and then move everything around. Repeat until the sweet potatoes and sausage both have golden brown exteriors.\nIn a bowl, combine the sweet potato and sausage mixture with the kale. Transfer to the lined baking dish.\nBring a 1/2 cup milk to a low boil and then lower the heat to simmer. Whisk in the flour and remaining 1/4 cup milk to form a thick paste. Add the broth, whisking to keep the sauce smooth. Add 1/4 cup Gruyere and stir until melted.\nPour the sauce over the sweet potatoes, kale and sausage in the baking dish. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese and bake for 10 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted.",
