    "des": "\"This Root beer is bound to be a hit at any gathering.  It is very easy, ice cold and yummy.  Use a large insulated drink cooler to brew it in, and everyone can help themselves using the spigot.  This is best to do outdoors or place the cooler in the kitchen sink as it brews. Dry ice can be dangerous. Be sure to use gloves when handling. Do not allow children to handle the dry ice.\"",
    "ins": "In a large cooler, mix together the sugar and water, stirring to dissolve sugar completely. Stir in the root beer extract. Carefully place the dry ice into the cooler, and cover loosely with the lid. Do not secure the lid, as pressure may build up.\nLet the mixture brew for about an hour before serving. Leftover root beer can be stored in one gallon milk jugs.",
