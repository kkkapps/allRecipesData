Arrange a layer of veal chops atop the cheese layer. Top each chop with 2 to 3 slices butter, 1/3 of the mushrooms, and 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/4 of the provolone cheese, and 1/4 of the white Cheddar cheese. Continue layering with the remaining ingredients.\nPour enough water into the casserole dish to just cover the bottom; cover dish with aluminum foil and an oven-safe lid.\nBake in the preheated oven until veal is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.",
