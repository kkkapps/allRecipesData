Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to potatoes to steam dry for a minute or two.\nStir the reserved pears, evaporated milk, vanilla, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the sweet potatoes and mash until smooth.
