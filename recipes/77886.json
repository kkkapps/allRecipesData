    "ins": "Place the sweet potatoes into a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain water, and place potatoes in a large casserole dish.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, stir together the butter, brown sugar, red hot candies, and water. Pour over the sweet potatoes in the dish.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until sweet potatoes are soft, and the candies are melted. After this, you may top with marshmallows, and return the dish to the oven for 10 minutes to toast them.",
