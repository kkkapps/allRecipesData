    "ins": "Soak cod in a large bowl of water in the refrigerator for 24 hours, changing soaking water 4 to 5 times to remove the salt.\nRinse the cod under running water; drain. Remove skin and bones.\nTransfer cod to a saucepan and cover with water. Heat over low heat until it is soft and flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes. Drain cod and let cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes. Shred finely and transfer to a large saucepan.\nPlace saucepan over low heat. Pour in olive oil in a slow, steady stream, beating vigorously, until mixture thickens to the consistency of mayonnaise, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, parsley, salt, and white pepper. Let cool before serving, about 15 minutes.",
