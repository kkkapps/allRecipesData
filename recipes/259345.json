    "des": "\"I spotted a box of fusilli pasta in my pantry and immediately decided to make an Italian dish with green vegetables and a pesto! My Italian vegetable fusilli with basil mint pesto was amazing, if I can say so myself.\"",
    "ins": "Place pine nuts in a skillet over medium heat. Toast until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and let cool.\nCombine pine nuts, basil, parsley, mint, and garlic in a food processor or mini chopper; pulse until finely chopped. Add 1 cup olive oil and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; pulse to incorporate. Season pesto with salt and pepper.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water. Wipe out pot.\nHeat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in the pot over high heat. Add asparagus; season with salt and pepper. Cook until crisp-tender and browned in spots, about 4 minutes. Stir in spinach and cook just until wilted, 3 minutes. Add pesto and fusilli; toss well to coat. Stir in reserved cooking water if pesto looks dry.",
