    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour the ice cream into a large bowl; fold the flour into the ice cream until the dough just begins to come together. Using your hands, gently knead the dough into a ball, adding flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 9x13 inch rectangle. Cut the dough into 12 circles, 3 inches in diameter, and place on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.",
