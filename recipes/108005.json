    "des": "\"Roasted stuffed tomatoes work best with the firm, dry Italian plum (often called Roma) tomato. Salt the tomato shells, then let sit upside down for 30 minutes to drain off excess liquid before stuffing.\"",
    "ins": "Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and turn, cut side down, to drain for 30 minutes on a wire rack set over a cookie sheet with a rim. Meanwhile, warm a small skillet over low heat. Add pinenuts; saute, stirring constantly until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.\nAdjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Mix feta, cream cheese, olives, pinenuts and oregano in a medium bowl. Turn tomatoes cut side up and fill with about 2 Tbs. of the feta mixture.\nBake until tomatoes are soft but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with oil. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.",
