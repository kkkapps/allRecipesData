    "des": "\"Looking for something quick one evening, I had leftover rice and shrimp. The rest is history and my family loves these. For best results, refrigerate the cooked tomatoes overnight. They get better upon rewarming on the second day.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.\nRemove the tops from tomatoes; scoop out the insides. Chop the tomato meat and set aside for later use. Liberally season the insides of tomatoes with salt and black pepper.\nMelt butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and green onion until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add green pepper, ham, rice, and thyme; cook until warmed, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nFill each tomato with the rice mixture, 2 to 3 shrimp, and reserved tomato meat. Pour about 1 tablespoon chicken broth into each tomato. Place tomatoes in the prepared baking dish. Spoon any leftover rice mixture and tomato meat around the stuffed tomatoes in the baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle tomatoes with Parmesan cheese and bake until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 more minutes.",
