    "des": "\"A yummy soup that even picky kids will love! Red beans and black beans are mildly seasoned and simmered in vegetable broth. With these ingredients this is a healthy vegetarian soup with a complete protein. If you add the chili powder, leave out the maple syrup. It totally changes the taste. Garnish with sour cream, green onions and tortilla chips for a festive meal. This is great served with cornbread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrots and garlic; cook and stir for a few minutes to release the flavors. Season with maple syrup, cumin, chili powder, and black pepper. Pour in the vegetable broth, black beans, 1 can of red beans, and corn. Bring to a boil.\nMeanwhile, combine the remaining can of red beans and crushed tomatoes in the container of a large food processor or blender. Process until smooth. Pour into the soup pot, and stir to blend. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes.",
