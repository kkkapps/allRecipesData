    "des": "\"If you love cilantro, you will love this hummus! I usually adjust the cilantro and lemon juice for flavor after mixing. Be sure to wear gloves while preparing the jalapeno; the oil will stay on your skin for a long time and will burn your eyes if you wear contacts. (I found out the hard way!) The hummus can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated. Return to room temperature before serving with crackers or pita bread.\"",
    "ins": "Puree the garbanzo beans, cilantro, lemon juice, tahini, jalapeno pepper, garlic, cumin, and salt in a blender or food processor using long pulses until the mixture is fairly smooth and slightly fluffy. Make sure to scrape the mixture off the sides of the food processor or blender in between pulses.\nTransfer hummus to a serving bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.",
