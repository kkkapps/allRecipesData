One of his specialties was his Bloody Mary, and no matter how many pitchers he prepared for company, they always wanted more. My only modification has been to add a bit of horseradish. This is a great brunch beverage, but various friends always ask if I'll please make 'Al's Bloodys' when they come for dinner.\"",
