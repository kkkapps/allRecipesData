    "ins": "Immerse dried cherries in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and set in a small bowl with the cherry liqueur to soak, the longer, the better. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, cream the butter with the brown sugar and white sugar. Stir in the egg, vanilla, and almond extract. Sift together the flour, and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture. Gently fold in the cherries, with the liqueur, white chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate and macadamia nuts. Batter should be soft and creamy.\nDrop cookie dough by tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheet. Leave 2 to 3 inches of space between cookies. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, cookies should be lightly browned. Remove from baking sheet to cool on wire racks.",
