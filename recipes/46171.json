    "des": "\"This is an old English recipe that is especially good on meats.  Instead of parsley you may substitute mint, rosemary, sage, tarragon, or thyme. If you can only find dried parsley, use 1/4 cup.\"",
    "ins": "Make a strong infusion by pouring the boiling water over the parsley. Let stand for 15 minutes. Strain out bits of parsley, and reserve liquid in a glass or stainless steel saucepan.\nStir the honey and vinegar into the parsley water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the pectin, and continue to boil, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from heat, and skim off any foam from the top. Transfer to sterile jars, and seal in a hot water bath.",
