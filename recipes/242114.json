    "des": "\"A light yet flavorful quinoa dish that goes great with fish or chicken! I invented it on-the-fly one day when I couldn't find quite what I was looking for. For a stronger flavor, add extra lemon juice and herbs. For a more al dente quinoa, remove the lid half way through the cooking time and continue to cook uncovered until most of the water is absorbed.\"",
    "ins": "Stir water, quinoa, lemon juice, lemon zest, parsley, basil, garlic, and seasoning blend together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Let rest, covered, for 5 minutes; fluff with a fork.",
