    "ins": "Place the bouillon cubes, onion, potatoes, and cabbage into a large soup pot. Pour in enough water to cover the vegetables by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes. Add the sausage, and cook for an additional 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and stir in cheese and evaporated milk. Cook just until heated through and cheese is melted - do not allow the soup to boil. Remove from heat, and serve immediately.",
