Stir in the tomato paste, chili powder, ancho chile powder, ground cumin, ground ginger, vanilla, and sugar.  Cook, stirring, until blended, about 2 minutes.

Stir the pineapple juice,  kidney beans, black beans, tomatoes, and chipotle salsa into the ingredients in the slow cooker and set the heat to High.  Allow the chili to cook on High until it begins to bubble, about 20 minutes.  Turn the slow cooker to Low and cook for 1 additional hour.\nStir the reserved pineapple into the chili and continue to cook until the pineapple is warm, about 15 minutes.   Salt and pepper the chili to taste and serve piping hot.",
