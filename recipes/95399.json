    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease a  9x13 inch baking dish.\nBreak spaghetti into 2-inch pieces.  Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nCombine onion, pimiento, and green pepper with cooked spaghetti, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, turkey meat, mushroom soup, chicken broth, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.  Mix lightly and spread the mixture in the baking dish and top with 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese.\nBake, uncovered, in oven for 45 minutes until the casserole is bubbling and cheese topping is melted and browned.",
