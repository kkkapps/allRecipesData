    "des": "\"A moist, flourless treat that comes together in minutes. A delicious way to incorporate healthy omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and fiber into your diet! The pumpkin is subtle, lends a touch of sweetness, and replaces oil in the recipe. Toasted with butter makes a winning breakfast! \nFeel free to make this savory by replacing the pumpkin with 1/4 cup oil, omitting the honey, and adding rosemary, garlic, sun dried tomatoes, parmesan cheese etc.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nWhisk flax seed and baking powder together in a large bowl; add eggs and beat until smooth. Beat pumpkin, water, honey, salt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon into flax mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 20 minutes.",
