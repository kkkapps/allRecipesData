    "des": "\"This recipe lets you use up left-over sweet potato. The cake is very moist, so you don't really need icing. Better yet, if you have left-over sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving, freeze them, and make this cake for Christmas. The whipped sweet potatoes I use already have some butter and sugar, so I only use 1 3/4 cups of sugar in the batter, but adjust the sugar amount to your liking.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking dish.\nStir together the sugar and vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and sweet potatoes. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a separate bowl; stir into the batter 1 cup at a time, alternating with the beer just until everything comes together. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.\nBake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool completely before frosting or serving.",
