In a separate bowl, mix together the panko crumbs, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.\nCut jalapenos in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds. Stuff each jalapeno half with equal portions of the blue cheese. Place the halves back together and secure with toothpicks. Dip each stuffed jalapeno in the egg mixture and then coat with the panko mixture. Arrange the breaded peppers on a baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
