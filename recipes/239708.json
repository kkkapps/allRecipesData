    "des": "\"Gluten-free version of everybody's favorite. The method and ingredient ratios were suggested to me by members of this site, then tweaked by me. I have tested this a few times and these ingredients are optimal for a simple batter which allow the flavor of the vegetables and chicken to shine through. My whole family enjoyed it, even those who aren't gluten-intolerant.\"",
    "ins": "Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dry sliced bell pepper, onion, and zucchini on a paper towel.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl; add beer and sparkling water. Stir until batter just combined.\nWorking in batches, dip bell pepper, onion, and zucchini slices into batter, draining excess; fry in preheated oil until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer vegetables to a plate lined with paper towels.\nDip chicken breasts into remaining batter and fry in oil until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain excess oil on paper towels.",
