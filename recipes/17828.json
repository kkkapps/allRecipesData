    "des": "\"Here's an easy, thick potato soup. Potatoes are boiled with celery and onion and then reduced to a rich, creamy texture. I use one per cent milk, but any milk should work fine.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over high heat, combine the potatoes, celery and onion with the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.\nDrain the water, reserving 2 cups of water in the pot. Add the milk, butter and potato flakes. Stir all together well until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
