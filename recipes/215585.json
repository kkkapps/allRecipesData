Drain any excess liquid from the skillet.\nReduce the heat to medium. Add the carrot and celery to the pork mixture; cook and stir until the carrot and celery begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the soy sauce and green onions into the mixture; remove the skillet from the heat and add the hoisin sauce and pine nuts. Stir the mixture until evenly mixed. Fold the watermelon into the mixture.\nSpoon the pork mixture into the middle of the lettuce leaves; wrap the lettuce around the filling to serve.",
