    "des": "\"It must have been the subliminal beer and liquor advertising that got me, because I wasn't even thinking about Cinco de Mayo when I decided to make this milk-braised pork carnitas recipe.\u00c2\u00a0The milk braising beforehand seems to give the meat a little extra succulence.\u00c2\u00a0The subtle sweetness from the orange is also very nice.\"",
    "ins": "Season pork with pepper and salt.\nHeat oil in large pot over high heat. Working in batches, cook pork in the hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Return all cooked pork and accumulated juice to pot.\nSeason pork with bay leaves, cumin, dried oregano, and cayenne pepper. Stir in fresh orange juice, orange zest, and milk. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is fork tender but not falling apart, about 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nRemove pork from liquid. Skim some fat from the pot to grease a baking dish. Transfer the pieces of pork to the baking dish. Drizzle about 2 more tablespoons of the floating fat over the meat. Season with more salt, if needed.\nBake in preheated oven until pork is browned, about 15 minutes. Stir pork.\nTurn on oven's broiler. Cook pork under broiler until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.",
