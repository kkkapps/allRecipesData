    "ins": "Beat milk, egg, applesauce, ground ginger, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk baking mix into the milk mixture until just combined into a loose batter.\nPrepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat.\nLadle about 1/4 cup batter into the prepared skillet; cook until bubbles begin to form on the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the pancake and continue cooking until the other side of the pancake is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes more. Transfer pancake to a plate and cover with a lid to keep warm. Repeat until batter is completely used.",
