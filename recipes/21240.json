Pour into prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.\nMeanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and saute onion, celery, green pepper and garlic.  When onions are tender stir in thyme, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, cayenne and broth.  Bring to a boil and then remove from heat.\nCrumble the cornbread and stir into broth mixture; mix well.  Add more broth or more bread, as necessary, to achieve desired consistency.",
