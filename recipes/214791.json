    "des": "\"Puffy oven-baked buttery pancake. It's SO easy! You may never make traditional pancakes again. Pour your favorite syrup over it, or just dust powdered sugar on top. There's not much need to add more butter because it's already baked onto the top and forms a delicious salty and buttery crust.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nWhisk the eggs, flour, milk, salt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside.\nPut the butter in a 9x11-inch baking dish. Melt the butter in the preheated oven, making sure it doesn't burn, about 5 minutes. Pour the batter into the baking dish with the melted butter.\nReturn to the oven and bake until the pancake is puffed and no longer moist in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.",
