    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat on the \"Combo 3\" setting).\nCook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces.\nToss potatoes with vegetable oil to coat; season with salt and pepper. Spread potatoes on a baking sheet.\nBake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes in the conventional oven and 20 minutes in the countertop induction oven. Cool potatoes until easily handled, about 5 minutes.\nSlice off the top 1/4 of each potato lengthwise. Scoop flesh into a bowl using a melon baller or small spoon, leaving about 1/8 inch of flesh on the skin.\nMash melted butter and mascarpone cheese into the potato flesh in the bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until fluffy, about 30 seconds. Stir in bacon, green onions, and Cheddar cheese. Fill potato skins with potato mixture; return to the baking sheet.\nBake filled potatoes in the preheated oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Turn on the oven's broiler; broil potatoes until cheese is bubbly and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oven.\nSeason shrimp with Creole seasoning; transfer to a grill pan.\nGrill shrimp over high heat until opaque, about 3 minutes. (If using a countertop induction oven, cook shrimp on the \"Grill setting\" until opaque, about 3 minutes.) Top each potato with 1 shrimp.",
