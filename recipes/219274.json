    "des": "\"Affectionately referred to as 'flat chicken' by my family, this recipe is a favorite! My mom would make it once a week and now my kids and I carry on the tradition. It is flavorful, easy and goes well with rice or pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Beat eggs and black pepper together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate, shallow bowl.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip each piece of chicken breast into the beaten eggs, and then press into the bread crumbs. Brush loose bread crumbs off the chicken, and place into the hot oil. Pan fry until golden brown on each side, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Remove chicken from heat.\nArrange chicken pieces on serving platter, and drizzle a small amount of the caper juice over the chicken. Top with the capers, and serve with lemon wedges.",
