    "ins": "Place the pears into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until fruit is soft, about 30 minutes. Drain and transfer the pears to a blender. Puree the pears and return them to the pot.\nStir the sugar, sweetener, orange zest, nutmeg and orange juice into the pot and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring frequently until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the gelatin until completely dissolved. Ladle into hot sterile jars and seal with lids and rings, or fill freezer containers and freeze if you prefer.",
