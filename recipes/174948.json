Top four of the patties with even portions of the cheese mixture. Top each with one of the remaining patties. Pinch the edges together to seal.\nBake the patties in the preheated oven until cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes, turning once.\nHeat the olive oil in a skillet over low heat. Cook and stir the red onion in the hot oil until browned; remove the onion and discard. Stir the flour into the oil and cook until deep brown in color. Remove the pan from the heat and add the chicken broth, red wine, parsley, minced onion, bay leaf, and thyme. Return the pan to heat and bring to a boil while stirring; season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the patties to serve.",
