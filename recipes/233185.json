Place half the veggie mix in center of sheet of foil.  Spoon half the butter mixture over veggies.\nBring up sides of  Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil over veggies; fold down two times.  Double fold both ends of foil to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside.  Repeat to make second packet.  Place packets on baking sheet with 1-inch sides.\nBake 15 to 20 minutes or until veggies are desired crispness.  Open packets carefully by cutting along top folds with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape.  Stir to coat evenly.",
