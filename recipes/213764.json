    "des": "\"I've made this recipe for years as a quick after work dinner.  Inexpensive and delicious.  I pack up leftovers for lunch for no waste.  Use with boneless or bone-in chops.  Try them.  You'll make this one a repeat.\"",
    "ins": "Season the pork chops with seasoned salt on both sides. Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and grease with cooking spray. Cook the pork chops until golden brown on both sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.\nStir the cream of celery soup, cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and sage together in the skillet until combined. Stir in the green beans and O'Brien potatoes, then place the pork chops on top of the vegetables. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the pork chops are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.",
