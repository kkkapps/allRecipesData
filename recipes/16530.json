    "des": "\"You can use any kind of chili pepper you like - I like poblano or chipotle the best. Buy them dried and put them in your blender to make powder!  Serve warm with a dollop of sour cream if desired. You can substitute taco sauce for enchilada sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium mixing bowl, combine mashed potatoes, 3/4 cup cheese, chili powder, cumin, garlic, salt and pepper. Spoon evenly into tortillas, and roll up. Place rolled tortillas side by side in a 8x8 inch baking pan. Spread enchilada sauce evenly over the top, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.",
