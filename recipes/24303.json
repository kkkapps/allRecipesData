    "des": "\"Baking with this mix is all fun and no fuss. Give it in a big jar, with the recipe, baking sheets, parchment paper, a metal rack and oven mitts as a special gift, at Christmas, Easter, housewarming or any time.  Especially effective when young students are just moving away from home for the first time.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl combine oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  With a pastry blender cut in shortening until crumbly.  Stir in raisins, coconut, chocolate chips and pecans.\nRefrigerate in an airtight container for up to 10 weeks.\nAttach a tag that reads:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease a baking sheet, or line with parchment paper.  Measure 4 cups of the mix into a large bowl.  Whisk together 1 egg, 2 tablespoons milk and 2 teaspoons vanilla; stir into the mix.  Roll into 1 1/2 inch balls and place on prepared baking sheet.  Flatten with a fork dipped in sugar.  Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden.  Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
