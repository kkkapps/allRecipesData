    "des": "\"Easy and yummy! Banana pancakes from scratch, with the perfect coconut syrup. My family absolutely loves them! I usually have to triple the recipe! It took me forever to find a good banana pancake recipe I like. It took me even longer to find coconut syrup I liked. This syrup is great because it doesn't have any of the coconut shavings in it. So kids will like it!\"",

Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until incorporated.\nBeat banana in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; mix creamed banana into batter. Stir melted butter into batter. Refrigerate batter for 10 minutes.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into the hot oil, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.\nCombine 1 cup white sugar, buttermilk, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil for 1 minute; reduce heat and mix coconut extract and baking soda into the syrup. Simmer until baking soda is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes.",
