    "des": "\"I like my fillings, aside from the cheese, mixed in the egg part of the omelet rather than sliding about, so this uses that technique. The result is more of a folded frittata than a classic omelet, but it's very tasty. This variation on fillings is hearty and flavorful.\"",
    "ins": "Lightly whisk the eggs with the milk in a bowl to break the yolks and integrate the milk; season with 4 pinches black pepper and 2 pinches garlic salt.\nHeat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and onion in hot oil until the onion softens, about 5 minutes.\nSpread the mushrooms and onion into the bottom of the skillet so it forms an even layer.\nSprinkle spinach evenly across the top of the mushroom and onion layer.\nPour egg mixture over the vegetables.\nCook until the top of the egg is set, 3 to 5 minutes.\nSprinkle Stilton cheese and mozzarella cheese over the cooked egg; cook until the mozzarella begins to melt, fold the omelet in half around the filling to make a half-moon.",
