    "des": "\"Yummy! This soup is great! I make this soup when I make an Italian dinner for guests and everyone wants the recipe. It's also great on those cold winter days where suppers call for a hot and delicious soup. A combination of sausage and vegetable in a beefy broth. This may be made a day in advance. Tastes even better the second day. Enjoy!\"",

Cook and stir until onion is soft, 7 to 10 minutes.\nPour water, garbanzo beans with liquid, beef bouillon cubes, and sage into sausage mixture. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until carrots are tender, about 10 minutes. Skim and discard any accumulated fat.
