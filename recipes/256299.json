    "des": "\"This Mexican-inspired shakshuka is a tomato-y one-skillet poached eggs dish that's full of all the flavors you expect from Mexican recipes. Diced tomatoes, onions, and smoked peppers, plus cumin, chili powders and Spanish paprika. And together, they make this one hearty meal to feed a crowd from one skillet. Serve with warmed corn or flour tortillas and butter-fried hominy.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Saute onions until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add chopped roasted pepper and garlic; saute until garlic releases its fragrance, 1 or 2 minutes longer. Stir in tomato paste, chili powder and ancho chili powder, cumin, and paprika. Saute for another minute or so until well combined.\nStir in Hunt's(R) Diced Tomatoes and water. Season with salt and pepper. Raise heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to medium and cook about 5 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Make a well for each egg and pour 1 egg into each well. Cover; poach until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 5 minutes.",
