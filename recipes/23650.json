    "des": "\"This is for all the people who don't like pumpkin pie. I don't like pumpkin pie either, but this one's different. It's so spicy!! It has become a much anticipated family custom. It's best to make your own pie shell instead of using the ready made kind because they aren't deep enough. This recipe is easily doubled.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C.)\nIn a large bowl, combine pumpkin puree, milk, cream, brown sugar and white sugar. Mix in the cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Beat in the flour and eggs. Pour filling into pie shell.\nBake for 10 minutes at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) then reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for 50 minutes, or until filling has set.",
