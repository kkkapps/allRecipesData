    "ins": "Whisk the soy sauce, lime juice, sunflower oil, jalapeno pepper, garlic, ginger, coriander, brown sugar, and lime zest together in a bowl until the sugar dissolves. Place the chicken into a resealable plastic bag, and pour the marinade overtop. Mix to coat chicken, then seal bag, and refrigerate at least 2 hours.\nHeat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Place into skillet, skin-side down, and cook until the skin crisps, about 4 minutes. Turn chicken over, and continue cooking on the other side until no longer pink in the center. Once done, remove the chicken and keep warm. Pour the remaining marinade into a skillet. Dissolve cornstarch in water, and stir into the sauce until thickened and clear. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes. Serve chicken with sauce.",
