    "des": "\"No-carb paleo cloud rounds. Fresh out of the oven, they are fluffy and light. Storing them overnight in a plastic bag adds some elasticity to them so they become more bread-like.\n\nThe rounds will rise and fall a bit during the bake, but they don't run and flatten only slightly depending on how long you whipped the whites.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPlace cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl and warm in the microwave at 10-second intervals until softened, about 30 seconds. Cool to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Mix in egg yolks until smooth.\nPlace egg whites and baking powder in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl; beat together until stiff peaks form.\nFold yolk mixture gently into egg whites until batter is just combined and light yellow in color.\nScoop batter into 4-inch rounds on baking sheet, flattening peaks with the back of the spoon.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes.",
