Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in almond extract. Fold in flour until just blended. Spread batter into prepared pan. With the tip of a knife, mark squares in the batter. Spoon equal portions of pie filling in the center of each square.\nBake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
