    "des": "\"I make the dough on Saturday night, and shape the rolls on Sunday morning.  The rolls rise while I am at church, and are ready to pop into the oven for Sunday dinner.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir yeast, 1/4 cup warm water, and a pinch of sugar.\nIn another bowl, beat eggs in 1 cup warm water; add oil and salt.  Mix egg mixture into yeast, and add sugar.  Gradually add flour. Cover with a damp cloth, and allow to stand at room temperature for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator and allow to rise overnight. This dough is rather sticky, and will raise to at least twice it's size.\nDivide the dough into 4 equal parts.  Roll each section out into a circle on a floured board or wax paper.  Cut into pizza slice shapes, and roll slices large end to small end.  Place on greased flat baking pans, and allow to rise for 2 hours.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 minutes.",
