    "des": "\"This is my favorite, very simple, recipe for savory scones.  They are wonderful served hot, spread with a little butter, and eaten alongside a steamy hot soup. It's important not to over handle these scones, as they will be heavy and tough.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nIn a large bowl, sift together flour and salt. Rub in butter lightly with finger tips until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Stir in cheese and garlic. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the milk, reserving 1 teaspoon for a glazing the scones. Gently mix, just until combined.\nTurn out onto a lightly floured board and knead briefly and lightly. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Press out dough to form a 1 inch thick round. Cut into 8 wedges. Place on prepared tray and brush with reserved milk.\nBake in preheated oven for 10 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Serve hot or let cool on a wire rack.",
