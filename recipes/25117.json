Stir in the water and baking mix. Mix in the chocolate chips. Roll into walnut sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with the tines of a fork.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
