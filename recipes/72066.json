Refrigerate until ready to use.\nHeat olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Whisk eggs and milk together in a shallow dish. Place bread crumbs in a large resealable plastic bag. Dip the abalone steaks in egg, then place in the bag with the crumbs and shake to coat.\nFry coated abalone for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Place on a platter, and garnish with lime slices and parsley. Serve with the cocktail sauce for dipping.",
