    "des": "\"This is my take on a Louisiana classic.  No shortcuts!  Put everything into the slow cooker in the morning and you will have your meal ready in the late afternoon or evening, whenever you are ready.  This recipe will feed a lot of people.\"",
    "ins": "Place the beans and water into a slow cooker. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the sausage in the skillet; remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon and transfer to the slow cooker. Reserve drippings. Add onion, green pepper, jalapeno pepper and garlic to the drippings; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer everything from the skillet to the slow cooker.\nSeason the mixture with pepper and Creole seasoning. Add the fresh basil leaves and ham hock. Cover and cook on low for about 8 hours, or until beans are tender. If the bean mixture seems too watery, take the lid off the slow cooker and set heat to High to cook until they reach a creamy texture.",
