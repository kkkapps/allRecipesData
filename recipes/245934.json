    "des": "\"My Bananas Foster French Toast Bake travels well after baking, plus it is great to serve on Christmas morning. It's simple to make, and most of the work is done the day before baking. Who doesn't love French toast and bananas Foster? Two great tastes combine for this must-make holiday favorite in my home.\"",
