Place bread cubes in the bottom of the casserole dish and pour pineapple mixture on top.\nBake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown and set throughout.  If the top browns too fast, before the center is set, cover the dish with aluminum foil until it sets.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.",
