    "des": "\"This is an easy recipe similar to chili-mac but made with spaghetti. My son loved it and thought it was a neat concept. He even wanted it for breakfast the next day!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir spaghetti into the beef mixture; add kidney beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, mushrooms, water, chili seasoning mix, and Parmesan cheese. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until hot, about 10 minutes. Top with Cheddar cheese.",
