    "des": "\"Yummy, healthy, comfort food. This simple dish of beans and rice is tasty and helps cleanse the body and heal digestion for all body types. I also love this dish for an easy, healthy, pantry meal I can throw together when I have nothing else in the house. Top with ghee, salt, liquid aminos, or whatever you like. I like lemon pepper, sriracha sauce, and feta cheese.\"",
