    "des": "\"This recipe is a unique take on all the classic vegetable dips.  While it looks like a mustard dip,  it's really turmeric that gives it the vibrant yellow color.  It's easy for kids to make, plus it's easy to remember the proportions since they're all about the same.  This is sure to be a party pleaser!!\"",
