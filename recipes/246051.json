    "des": "\"This is a great alternative to any potato side dish. Cauliflower has half the calories of potatoes and one-tenth the simple carbohydrates - so you can get your calories where you want to, from the cheese and butter! This recipe is so savory you just might prefer it to potatoes - my family certainly does. Have it with a salad and a nice steak. Like most of my recipes, this one feels a little tedious and plods along the first time you make it. However, it really is quite simple and so packed with flavor that you can't go wrong!\"",
    "ins": "Cut cauliflower florets from the stems. Separate florets into their smallest subsections. Slice and halve stems into small pieces.\nWhisk half-and-half, 3 teaspoons black pepper, garlic powder, and salt together in a small bowl.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nScatter 1/3 of the butter cubes and 1/3 of the garlic slices on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 of the cauliflower on top. Scatter another 1/3 of the butter cubes and garlic slices on top. Cover with 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the half-and-half mixture. Repeat layering remaining butter cubes, garlic slices, cauliflower, and Cheddar cheese. Pour in remaining half-and-half mixture.\nSprinkle remaining 1 teaspoon of black pepper on top of the baking dish. Arrange the mozzarella cheese slices across the top, covering the layers underneath.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle Romano cheese and paprika on top.\nReturn to the oven and continue baking until cheese crust is golden-brown, about 15 minutes.",
