    "des": "\"My husband is a 'lover' of crab meat. Since crab can be costly and he also 'loves' fish I arranged this 'sweetheart' of a dish. The intermingling of fish and crab with the flavor of mushrooms and onion baked in wine accompanied by the creamy taste of cheese sets the table for romance. Set your table with candles and flowers and enjoy!\"",
