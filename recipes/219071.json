    "ins": "Whisk together the flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, black pepper, nutmeg, dried parsley, and chili powder in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Transfer half the flour mixture into another bowl. Beat eggs in a third bowl.\nHeat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDredge chicken pieces into flour mixture in the first bowl, then dip into beaten egg; finally dip each piece in flour mixture from the second bowl. Place 3 or 4 breaded chicken pieces at a time into the hot oil, and deep-fry until the chicken is golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken piece should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).\nStir the hot sauce with soy sauce in a saucepan over low heat; slowly stir the honey into the sauce, mixing until well combined. Stir butter into the sauce. Place the deep-fried chicken into a bowl, and toss with the sauce to serve.",
