Pour yeast mixture into flour mixture and knead dough using the dough hook attachment until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.\nPlace dough in a container and cover container with a towel or plastic wrap; let stand until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nDivide dough into 2-ounce portions and roll into 7-inch long sticks. Arrange sticks on the prepared baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap and let stand until dough doubles in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
