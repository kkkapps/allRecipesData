    "des": "\"With just a few ingredients and little effort, this recipe makes a great summer breakfast. I created it while on holidays in Maui while making french toast for breakfast. I noticed the drink mix sitting on the counter from the night before and inspiration struck. Top with sliced bananas and maple syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the eggs, milk, and pina colada mix in a bowl. Heat a skillet over medium heat; melt butter in the skillet until the foam disappears. Soak the bread slices in the egg mixture, turning the slices over a couple of times.\nGently lay the soaked bread slices into the hot skillet 2 at a time and pan-fry until the french toast is golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer cooked french toast slices to a warmed platter while you finish cooking. Top each 2-slice serving with several slices of banana to serve.",
