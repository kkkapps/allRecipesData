    "des": "\"My grandma always made Hoppin' John on New Year's Day when I was growing up in Virginia. I now live in New Mexico and decided to put a hot Southwestern spin on the recipe this year, hence the name. It's simple and tasty, and has some heat. I only added two jalapenos, but you could add more if you like it hotter. If you don't like hot food, you might want to eliminate the jalapenos completely. My husband and I both loved it.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, jalapeno peppers, and garlic in hot butter until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir cooked rice, black-eyed peas, diced tomatoes with habanero peppers, bacon, salt, and black pepper into vegetables. Cook for 10 minutes to blend flavors, stirring frequently.",
