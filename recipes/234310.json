    "des": "\"Using fresh figs and strawberry Jell-O, this is a very easy preserve recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Heat figs, sugar, and strawberry gelatin together in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a rolling boil. Cook fig mixture, stirring frequently, for 4 minutes; remove from heat.\nSterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pour hot fig mixture into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/2 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.",
