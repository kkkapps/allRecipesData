    "ins": "Soak mushrooms 20 to 30 minutes in cold water to rehydrate. Dry, and coarsely chop.\nHeat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms, garlic, and red pepper. Cook until browned. Stir in clams and white wine. As clams open, remove to a medium bowl, discarding those that remain closed.\nMix tomatoes, clam juice, and parsley into the mushroom mixture. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nReturn clams to the broth mixture and cook until heated through. Thoroughly mix in cooked linguine just before serving.",
