    "des": "\"A moist and delicious treat with a great mix of flavors. Perfect for those unused cranberries from Thanksgiving. You can use a variety of pans depending on what you have. Baking times will vary based on the pan. Two loaf pans take about an hour.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch fluted-tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).\nWhisk eggs, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.\nSift flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture. This is a very thick mixture so use a solid spoon to mix together. Fold in apples, cranberries, and pecans until evenly incorporated. Pour batter in the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes.",
