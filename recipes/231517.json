Measurements aren't listed perfectly, so you can also wing it. For best results, get all ingredients from Trader Joe's\u00c2\u00ae.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orecchietta pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to a casserole dish.\nHeat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus in the melted butter until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Spread asparagus over pasta layer.\nPour cream over asparagus and pasta; season with salt and black pepper. Arrange Brie cheese chunks in the pasta mixture; sprinkle top with bread crumbs.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread crumbs are lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.",
