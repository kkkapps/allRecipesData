    "ins": "To Make Crust: In a 10 inch skillet over medium heat, melt butter or margarine. Stir in dessert bar crust mix and almonds. Cook 4 minutes, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to brown and crumble.\nReserve 2 tablespoons of crust mixture for topping. Use the back of a fork to press remaining crust mixture into an ungreased 9 inch deep dish pie plate. Cool completely.\nTo Make Filling: Pour cold water into a 2 quart non-aluminum saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin over water and allow to soften 5 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir dessert bar filling mix into gelatin, mixing until smooth. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir for 1 minute, then remove from heat.\nPlace egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk 1/4 cup of hot lemon mixture into egg yolks. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into rest of lemon filling. Return mixture to heat. Boil and stir 1 minute. Remove from heat. Cover and refrigerate.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, combine cream cheese and 1/4 cup of lemon filling (may be slightly warm), beating until smooth. Gradually beat in remaining filling mixture until smooth. Mix in food coloring if desired.\nPour filling into crust. Cover and chill at least 4 hours before serving.
