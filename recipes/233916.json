    "des": "\"It was too rainy to grill so I prepared a baked version using boneless center-cut pork chops. I breaded the chops and added a baked apple garnish for flair. We were very pleased by the outcome. I used the fat line as marker for making the cuts for the stuffing. We like our pork well done so cooking time may vary according to your tastes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine Gouda cheese, bacon, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl.\nCut each pork chop from one side through the middle horizontally to within 1/2 inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book. Stuff cheese mixture into each pocket and close; secure with a wooden toothpick. Coat each stuffed pork chop with olive oil.\nWhisk egg in a bowl. Mix bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper to taste together in a separate bowl. Carefully dip each stuffed pork chop in the egg; press chop into bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Place breaded pork chops in a 9x13-inch casserole dish.\nBake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Garnish pork chops with cored apple, green onion, and red grapes.",
