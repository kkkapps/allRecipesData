    "ins": "Place the pears in a bowl with the lemon-lime soda. Set aside; this will keep them from turning brown.\nPlace the baby spinach in a serving bowl, and add the shallot, feta cheese and pine nuts. Drain the pears, and discard the soda. Add pears to the salad, and toss to blend. Serve with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.",
