    "des": "\"Wonderful cheesy flavor with a slight kick from the jalapenos. The pimiento and jalapenos add a nice color contrast to the pale orange sauce. Use your discretion with the amount of jalapenos. You can also sub 1/8 to 1/4 cup chopped hot mixed peppers. It's best to use a waxy-type potato so they will keep their shape.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil; cook the potatoes in the boiling water until just tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Drain and allow to cool to the touch before peeling and slicing thin. Place the sliced potatoes in a large bowl.\nPour the milk into a saucepan over medium heat; gradually whisk the flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder into the warming milk until smooth. Continue heating and stirring until the liquid is boiling and thickened. Add the Cheddar cheese and jalapeno peppers; cook and stir until the cheese is completely melted. Pour the sauce over the potatoes. Scatter the pimentos over the mixture; pour into the prepared dish.\nBake until the potatoes are completely tender, about 30 minutes.",
