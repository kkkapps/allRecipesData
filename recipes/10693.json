    "des": "\"Butter cookies topped with an almond.\"",
    "ins": "Sift flour, sugar, salt and baking powder together in a large bowl.  Using pastry blender or knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.\nBeat the egg together with 2 tablespoons of the water and the almond extract.  Add this to the flour mixture and mix with a fork until dough leaves the sides of the bowl.\nOn a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until it is smooth. Wrap it in foil or cling-wrap and refrigerate for one hour.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nForm dough into 1 inch balls and place them 3 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Flatten each cookie to about 1/4 inch thick and press an almond into the center of each.  Beat egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water and brush on cookies.\nBake 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack to cool.",
