    "ins": "Whisk 1 cup cream and egg yolks together in a bowl until smooth.\nCombine half-and-half, 1 cup cream, and red hot candies in a large saucepan over medium-low; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until candies dissolve, 5 to 10 minutes.\nPour 1 cup red hot candies mixture into the cream-egg mixture; whisk until mixture is evenly combined. Pour cream-egg mixture into red hot candies mixture in the saucepan. Cook and stir until a film forms on the back of a spoon when dipped into the mixture, keeping just under a boil, about 5 minutes.\nPour red hot candies mixture through a sieve into a bowl to collect any undissolved candies. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.\nPour red hot candies mixture into an ice cream maker and process according to manufacturers' instructions.",
