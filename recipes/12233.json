    "ins": "Soak the beans in the water overnight. The next morning, take the hull off beans. Place beans in a saucepan and add water to cover. Do not add seasoning. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook until beans are very tender, about 1 hour. Drain; when they have cooled slightly, mash beans.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine sugar, flour, butter, vanilla, eggs, and salt. Mix well. Stir in mashed beans; add cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cream.\nPour into a pie shell. Bake until a knife inserted near the center of the pie comes out clean, 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool completely before serving. Store pie in refrigerator.",
