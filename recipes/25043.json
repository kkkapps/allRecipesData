Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the quick oats and chocolate chips. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Place balls 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet and press to flatten slightly using a fork.\nBake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are golden brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.",
