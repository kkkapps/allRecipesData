    "ins": "Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour, dip in the beaten egg, and then coat with the bread crumbs, assuring each piece is evenly coated.\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink inside, 3 to 5 minutes per side.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour half of the pasta sauce into a glass baking dish. Lay the chicken into the sauce; pour the remaining pasta sauce on top of the chicken pieces. Spread one tablespoon of Caesar dressing on each piece of chicken.  Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses over the chicken.\nBake in the preheated oven until heated through and the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.",
