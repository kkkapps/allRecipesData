    "des": "\"This is a quick and delicious recipe that goes well with white rice by itself, or with white rice and lentils. Its filling and doesn't require too much salt or oil. A drier version can be eaten with flat bread, naan, or pita. Reduce chili powder for a kid-friendly meal. Fast-cooking vegetables such as beans, peas and corn can be added for extra crunch and color. You can use white onion instead of the more pungent red if you prefer. If you find the vegetables catching bottom without being fully cooked, add half a cup of water and replace lid. Once cooked, remove lid and cook on very low till the water evaporates.\"",

Add chili powder, turmeric, and salt; stir to coat vegetables.\nCover skillet and cook vegetables over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower and potatoes are softened, about 20 minutes.
