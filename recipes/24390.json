Saute leeks in butter until translucent.  Remove from heat.\nScrape the flesh from each artichoke leaf and place in the pan with the leeks.  Scrape the prickly choke away from the heart of the artichokes, chop the hearts and add to the leek mixture.  Return to medium heat and stir to combine.  Pour in broth and heat through.
