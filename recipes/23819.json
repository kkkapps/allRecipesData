Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add milk all at once to dry ingredients and stir with a fork until a soft dough is formed.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 8 to 10 times.  Roll out to a 12 inch square.\nGently spread butter over dough.  Combine brown sugar, cinnamon and raisins.  Sprinkle evenly on top of dough.  Roll up dough lightly like a jelly-roll.  Seal edge.  Cut into twelve 1 inch thick pieces.  Place in prepared muffin tins.\nBake in preheated oven for 14 to 18 minutes, until golden. Remove from heat immediately. Serve warm.",
