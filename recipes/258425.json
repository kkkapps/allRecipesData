Please try it, I promise you won't be disappointed. I'd love to hear some comments. Please be easy on me, this is my first post, but I'm sure you'll be happy making these babies! They rock!\"",

Repeat with remaining shrimp.\nPour flour onto a shallow plate. Whisk eggs and water together in a small bowl to make egg wash.\nPlace saltine crackers in a large resealable bag. Crush into fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Pour crumbs onto a plate.\nCoat each shrimp with flour. Dip in egg wash; roll in cracker crumbs on both sides. Transfer to a large plate. Refrigerate shrimp for 2 hours.\nHeat 1 inch vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook shrimp until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate.",
