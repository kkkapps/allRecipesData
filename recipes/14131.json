    "des": "\"Vegetarian sausage links can be bought at many supermarkets, experiment with the different brands and choose your favorite for this delicious gravy. If you would like a thicker gravy dissolve 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in 1 tablespoon warm water and mix into the gravy just before bringing it to a boil.\"",
