    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine the chicken, ham, and egg in a large bowl until well blended. Gradually add bread crumbs until the mixture loses its stickiness and can be easily formed into balls.\nForm the chicken mixture around the cheese cubes, forming 2 inch balls. Place on a plate.\nHeat 1 1/2 inches of oil in a deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the balls until the outsides are golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels, and place in baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is soft, about 20 minutes. Cool briefly before serving.",
