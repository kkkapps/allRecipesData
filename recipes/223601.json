    "des": "\"My entire family absolutely loves these buns with sloppy joes. They hold their shape and don't fall apart when combined with the 'juiciness' of the sloppy joes. I'm not going to buy sandwich buns again. They couldn't compare to these.\"",
    "ins": "Combine milk, sugar, butter, and salt in small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until butter melts. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.\nCombine 1 cup bread flour, egg, yeast, and milk mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook; beat at lowest speed for 1 minute. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Add 2 3/4 cups bread flour; mix at next-to-lowest speed until dough cleans sides of bowl and sticks to dough hook, about 2 minutes.\nPlace in lightly greased bowl, cover, and let raise in warm place until doubled (about 1 hour).\nTurn dough out onto lightly floured surface, punch down to get out air bubbles, and shape into rolls, placing rolls onto 2 lightly greased baking sheets. Cover with waxed paper and let rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour.\nBrush tops of buns with melted butter. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.",
