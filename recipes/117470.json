    "des": "\"Our family has an annual fish fry that centers around my mom's recipe. I think she makes the finest fried fish around. it's flaky and flavorful with a golden cracker-crumb coating, and her homemade tartar sauce is a fitting complement.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs and cracker crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dip fillets into eggs, then coat with crumbs. Let stand for 5 minutes.\nIn an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F. Fry fillets, a few at a time, for 2 minutes on each side or until fish is golden brown and flakes easily with a fork. Drain on paper towels. In a small bowl, combine the tartar sauce ingredients. Serve with fish.",
