    "des": "\"A dear friend gave me a similar recipe, which I have tweaked it a little bit. This is a great alternative to the heavy, marshmallowy, and extra-sweet dish that most of us love. The citrus flavor is always a surprise. It has become one of my most requested recipes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sweet potatoes on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until a fork can easily puncture a sweet potato, about 1 hour. Remove baking sheet from oven and cool sweet potatoes until easily handled, about 15 minutes.\nRemove skins from sweet potatoes and transfer sweet potatoes to a large bowl. Beat potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth. Add brown sugar and butter to sweet potatoes while they are still warm; beat until butter is melted and brown sugar is dissolved.\nMix orange zest, orange juice, ginger, lemon zest, and salt into sweet potatoes; transfer to 9x9-inch baking dish. Heat sweet potatoes in oven if desired.",
