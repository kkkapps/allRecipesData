    "des": "\"Yummy sour roast with delicious cream gravy to top on dumplings or mashed potatoes.  This has been in my family for over 60 years.\"",
    "ins": "In a large glass bowl or dish, stir together the vinegar, allspice berries, and water with some salt and pepper. Cover and marinate the meat in the mixture overnight in the refrigerator.\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the meat in a roasting pan with the marinating liquid, bay leaves and onion.\nCover, and roast for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, or until the roast is fork tender.\nLet the roast sit, and remove 1/3 cup of the meat juices to a saucepan. Stir together the cornstarch and heavy cream, and stir into the meat juices. Add 1 cup of water, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently until thickened. Do not allow the mixture to boil. This will be your gravy to put over dumplings, potatoes or meat.",
