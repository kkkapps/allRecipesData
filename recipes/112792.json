    "ins": "Fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until almost crisp. Remove bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels. Drain off grease from the skillet, leaving a thin coating on the bottom.\nUsing the same skillet, add the onions; cook and stir over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken livers, quickly browning them on the outside. Pour in the wine, adding more if needed to cover the chicken livers. Stir in the olives. Cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the bacon.",
