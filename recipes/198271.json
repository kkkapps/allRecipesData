Mix the egg yolks, cinnamon, and lemon zest into the almonds. Fold the egg whites into the mixture.\nLine a dish with parchment paper. Pour the mixture onto the parchment paper and smooth to a 1/2-inch layer. Place a sheet of parchment paper atop the mixture and then place a cutting board over the paper; place a few items on top of the cutting board to give it some weight.\nAllow the turron to dry for 3 days. Cut into 1-inch squares to serve.",
