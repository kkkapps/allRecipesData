My first batch was good, but since then I've experimented with more or less spice, other veggies like mushrooms, and meat. It's different every time I make it now. Serve over basmati rice with naan bread.\"",

Cook and stir 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, and raisins. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low, and simmer at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.",
