    "des": "\"If you like cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower, you're sure to like Romanesco too! It has a slightly sweet, nutty taste. The fact that it looks so beautiful is a bonus. In this recipe it is simply blanched in boiling water, then pan-fried in butter and flavored with garlic and parsley.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add Romanesco cauliflower florets and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cauliflower florets; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle parsley over the florets; cook and stir until flavors combine, 2 or 3 minutes more.",
