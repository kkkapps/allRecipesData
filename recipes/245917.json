Continue to cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Mix in the flour then add the broth, Worcestershire sauce and salt. Cook until mixture is thick and bubbly, 5 - 6 minutes.\nTurn off heat and work quickly to place the cold pie crust over the pan and fold the excess dough inward. Cut a steam vent in the center of the pie. Brush with the beaten egg and bake for 10 - 12 min until crust is golden brown.",
