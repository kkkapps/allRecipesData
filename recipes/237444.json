    "des": "\"This was a favorite among our guests at the bed and breakfast where I cooked for many years. If you wish, add saut\u00c3\u00a9ed onions or diced tomatoes to the mix. I sometimes serve this dish with pinto or black beans and a warmed flour tortilla. This dish also lends itself well to be served with a side of chorizo sausage or any other breakfast meat of your liking.\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tortilla strips and green chile peppers until strips are softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add eggs and Cheddar cheese; cook and stir until eggs are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.",
