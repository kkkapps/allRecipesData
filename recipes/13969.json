    "des": "\"This is a wonderful vegetarian recipe from the Cornucopia Restaurant which was in South Bend, IN.  It makes a very large pot of chili.  Freeze leftovers for a future meal, or cut ingredients in half for a normal pot of chili.\"",
    "ins": "Place beans in a large saucepan, and cover with water.  Soak overnight in the refrigerator.  Drain, and return to pan.  Add 9 cups water; cook for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender.\nMeanwhile, mix textured vegetable protein and boiling water together in a large bowl.  Set aside.\nIn a large saute pan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onions; cook and stir until soft and translucent.\nIn a large stock pot, combine beans, textured vegetable protein, onions, spices, salt, honey, molasses, chili sauce, tomato puree, and diced tomatoes.  Stir to mix well.  Simmer, stirring often for at least 1 hour.",
