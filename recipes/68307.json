Typically served for breakfast with butter or margarine.  Not a sweet waffle.  Best in a standard waffle iron (not Belgian).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat waffle iron.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the eggs, milk and oil. Combine the flour, salt and baking powder; stir into the milk mixture until it makes a smooth batter. Stir in corned beef.\nSpoon batter onto your waffle iron, close the lid, and cook until the waffle iron stops steaming and waffles are golden. Serve hot with butter.",
