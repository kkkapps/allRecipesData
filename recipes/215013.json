    "des": "\"A delicious fruity salsa topping to serve over fish or chicken, from a friend in Florida.  I always use whatever that I have left in a mixed greens salad the next day. Use any kind of fish -- I use tilapia or salmon. The fish may also be grilled, which is what I prefer. If I can't find a good fresh pineapple, I will use canned pineapple tidbits.\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, toss together the pineapple, strawberries, kiwifruit, mango, tomatoes, cilantro, and balsamic vinegar.\nSpray a skillet with cooking spray, and heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle tilapia fillets with seasoned pepper blend, and pan-fry until fish turns white and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve fish topped with salsa.",
