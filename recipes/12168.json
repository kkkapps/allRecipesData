    "ins": "To Make Dough:  Cream the confectioners' sugar and 3 eggs together in a large bowl.  Stir in the orange flower water. Add the butter or margarine, and mix well.  Slowly add the cake flour, blending only to combine. Scrape onto a piece of plastic, and wrap.  Chill for at least 1 hour.  Roll dough out on a floured surface, and fit into a 11 inch tart pan.  Make sure there are no holes in the dough.\nPlace the cherries into the tart shell.  Fit as many as you can in in one layer.\nTo Make Filling:  Using a mixer, cream together the 3 eggs, 1/4 cup flour, kirsch, cream, and white sugar until smooth.  Pour over the cherries.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 40 minutes, or until the filling is just set.  Allow to cool.  Serve warm or at room temperature.",
