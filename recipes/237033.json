    "ins": "Chill a metal bowl in the freezer.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add hot sauce and sugar to garlic; cook and stir until mixture is reduced and bubbling, about 5 minutes.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook wings in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nRemove wings from hot oil using a slotted spoon and transfer to the chilled bowl. Add garlic-hot sauce to wings and toss to coat. Transfer coated wings to a serving platter and garnish with green onion.",
