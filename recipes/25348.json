    "des": "\"These are great-tasting wheat rolls made with olive oil, regular bread flour, and whole wheat flour.  This recipe happened one night when I was making white Italian rolls, and I ran out of flour.  All I had left was wheat flour, and luckily for me, it worked out well.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, combine olive oil, white sugar and salt. Add boiling water and stir to dissolve sugar; let cool to lukewarm.\nIn a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.\nWhen sugar and water mixture has cooled, add yeast mixture, eggs, whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.\nDivide the dough into twenty four equal size pieces and form into rounds. Place the rounds on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.",
