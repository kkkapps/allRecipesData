    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch pan.\nCombine the self-rising flour, white sugar, brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  Stir in the pumpkin, then beat in the eggs, one at a time, until blended.\nPour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Immediately turn cake out onto a damp cotton towel.  Starting from a long side, roll cake with the towel jelly-roll fashion. Cool cake roll, seam side down, on wire rack until completely cool, about 1 hour.  Gently unroll to fill.\nTo make the cream cheese filling:  Cream together the butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy.  Beat in the confectioners' sugar, mixing until smooth.",
