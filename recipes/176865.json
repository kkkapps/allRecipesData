    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source.\nSlice the top and bottom off the pineapple. Cut into quarters and remove the core from each piece. Lay each section skin side down and, using a sharp knife, separate the fruit along the skin, allowing the fruit to rest on the skin for presentation. Cut the fruit into slices for easy eating. Place on a baking sheet and sprinkle each section with 2 tablespoons each of brown sugar and coconut.\nBroil until the coconut is toasted, about 5 minutes.",
