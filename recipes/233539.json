Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 2 hours.\nPreheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 14-inch pizza pans with 1 teaspoon oil; lightly dust each pan with cornmeal.\nDivide dough in half and roll out into 2 thin rounds. Transfer each round to a prepared pizza pan.\nSpread pizza sauce over dough; top with mushrooms, peppers, onions, olives, and oregano. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nBake pizzas in the preheated oven until crust is golden and sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Garnish with crushed red pepper.",
