Add the brown sugar, butter, condensed milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt to the mashed potato; beat with a wire whisk until fluffy. Crack the eggs into the bowl and continue whisking until the mixture is light in color; pour into the prepared dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 90 minutes.",
