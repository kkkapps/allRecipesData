    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium heat melt the butter or margarine, add the flour and stir well forming a paste, or roux. Add the salt and pepper. Slowly add the milk or half-and-half, stirring constantly until thickened. (Note: This may take a little while, but keep close as it can scorch quickly.)\nAdd cheese and continue to stir well until all cheese melts and mixture is smooth. Add the hot pepper sauce and the crab and allow to heat through. Ladle into individual bowls and sprinkle with chives just before serving.",
