    "ins": "Place potatoes in a medium saucepan with water to cover.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes, until potatoes are soft.  Drain and mash.\nIn a large bowl, combine 1 cup mashed potatoes, salt and vanilla until smooth.  Sift confectioners' sugar over potato mixture a cup at a time.  Stir into potatoes.   Mixture will liquefy at first when sugar is added, then gradually begin to thicken.  When it becomes the consistency of stiff dough, knead it, adding more sugar if necessary, or not using the whole amount if mixture is very stiff.  Cover with a damp cloth and chill until mixture holds its shape when formed into a small  (1/2 inch) ball.\nForm potato mixture into 1/2 inch balls.\nMelt confectioners' coating in a double boiler or in a small saucepan over low heat.  Dip balls in melted chocolate, then roll in coconut.  Let cool completely.  Store in an airtight container.",
