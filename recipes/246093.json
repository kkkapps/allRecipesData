I had never heard of it before but learned it is good for cooking and tea. Little did I know this little herb has some amazing detox and medicinal benefits. I love lemon but hate what the acid does to my teeth. With lemon verbena you get the flavor of lemon without the acid.\"",
    "ins": "Pour boiling water over verbena and mint sprigs; steep until desired flavor is reached, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in honey.",
