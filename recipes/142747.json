    "des": "\"Mango Jam can be made with any variety of mangoes. Semi-ripe mangoes work best, but either raw or ripe mangoes may be used.\"",
    "ins": "Boil, steam, or microwave the whole mangoes until soft. Cool, then remove the peel and inner seed; place the mango pulp in a large bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to mash the pulp well.\nPlace the sugar and water in a large saucepan over low heat, stir mixture, and bring to a boil. When mixture begins boiling, increase heat to medium-high. Continue boiling until fine, soft threads form, 270 degrees F (135 degrees C). Stir in the mango pulp, add the saffron threads, if desired, and boil until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.\nPour cooked jam into sterilized jars and seal according to canning directions.",
