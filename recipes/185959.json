    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nBeat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat until medium peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites should curl over slightly. Fold in cayenne pepper and salt. Add the pecans and stir until coated. Spread the mixture evenly on the parchment-lined baking sheet.\nBake 10 minutes, then turn the pecan pieces. Bake another 10 minutes until toasted. Remove from oven and let cool about 15 minutes.\nMound two cups of salad greens on each plate. Sprinkle each serving with 1/4 cup Gorgonzola cheese, then drizzle with a teaspoon of hazelnut oil. Top each salad with a cup of toasted pecans.",
