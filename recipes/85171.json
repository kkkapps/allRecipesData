Remove from heat, and let cool.\nPlace lentils in a food processor. Pour in olive oil and truffle oil, and pulse until almost smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add additional truffle oil if desired. Pulse to preferred thickness and consistency. If too thick, pour in a few teaspoons of water or broth to thin.",
