    "ins": "Melt the margarine in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and leeks, and cook until softened. Stir frequently. When the leeks and onions are soft, stir in the breadcrumbs, nuts, sage, oats, and egg until well blended. Remove from heat immediately, and allow to cool.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Shape the mixture into 6 large fat sausages. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the sausages until browned on all sides. Remove them from the skillet, and place them on a baking sheet. Brush the sausages with oil.\nRoast the sausages in the oven for 25 minutes, or until browned. Serve hot.",
