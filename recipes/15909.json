    "des": "\"Rolled breaded chicken breasts stuffed with Jarlsberg cheese, smothered in a light brown gravy and baked. Hearty and filling. Serve with mashed potatoes or broccoli and a salad. Manga!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPound the chicken breasts to about 1/8 inch thickness. In a shallow plate or bowl, mix together the bread crumbs and parsley. Place a slice of cheese on each breast, roll up tightly, then dip into the egg and then the bread crumb mixture. (Note: Hold roll closed; after dipping, you will see that it begins to stay together).\nIn a large skillet, saute garlic in olive oil. Add roll ups and brown quickly, just enough for the chicken to have a crisp outer coating. Remove roll ups from skillet and drain on paper towels.\nPour 1/2 of the chicken broth into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add all four roll ups. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, basting once with the remaining broth.",
