    "des": "\"Mom's original recipe is great, but I wanted something I could a) feel a bit better about feeding my 2-year-old, and b) feel better about eating half a loaf of every day. This is my spin. The best thing about it: take out the zucchini and add something you like instead.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4-inch loaf pans.\nMix flour, wheat bran, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer using the whisk attachment. Beat brown sugar, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; fold in zucchini. Pour zucchini mixture into flour mixture and mix well; pour into prepared loaf pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool bread in pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes; remove bread from pans and completely cool.",
