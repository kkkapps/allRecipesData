    "des": "\"Sections of corn are pickled on the cob. A great recipe for preserving fresh corn from the summer to enjoy later in the year. Be sure to use the freshest corn possible.\"",
    "ins": "Rinse the corn, and place in a large bowl with the salt and enough water to cover. Refrigerate until needed. Sterilize two 1quart jars in simmering water for 5 minutes.\nIn a large stock pot, stir together the vinegar, sugar and pickling spice. Add the bay leaves and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to be sure the sugar has dissolved.\nDrain and rinse the corn under cold water. Add to the pot with the pickling mixture. Return to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove corn with a slotted spoon, and fill the sterile jars. Remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaves from the liquid, and discard. Fill the jars of corn with the vinegar mixture to within 1/2 inch of the top. The corn should be completely covered. Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth. Seal with lids and rings.\nProcess the jars in a hot water bath for the time recommended by your local extension in your area. Most areas require about 10 minutes in a water bath of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Refrigerate after opening.",
