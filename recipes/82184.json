It is the type of everyday dish served to the family.  White kidney beans are slowly cooked in a tomato based sauce.  Serve it over plain white rice.\"",
    "ins": "In a slow cooker combine the beans, tomato paste, pimento sauce, garlic, onions,  cumin, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper. Mix until the beans are coated. Pour in beef broth, and top off with enough water to completely cover the beans.\nCover, and cook on High for 6 hours, or until the beans are tender and the liquid is thickened. It should not be soupy.",
