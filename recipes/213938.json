    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nPoke holes all over the orange with a fork, and insert the orange into the cavity of the chicken. Place the chicken into a deep roasting pan or Dutch oven, and coat well with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the potatoes, garlic cloves, carrots, and onions all around the chicken, and drizzle 1 more tablespoon of oil on the vegetables. Dissolve the chicken bouillon in the water, and pour into the pan with the beer. Cover the pan.\nBake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; uncover the pan, and baste the chicken with the juices in the pan. Return the pan to the oven, uncovered, and cook for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, basting with juices every 15 minutes.\nRaise the oven heat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and bake the chicken until the skin is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, and remove the vegetables from around the chicken. Drain off the juices to make gravy, if desired, and cover the chicken with the pan lid. Allow the chicken to stand about 10 minutes before serving with the vegetables.",
