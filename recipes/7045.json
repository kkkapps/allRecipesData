    "ins": "In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water, and let stand for 3 minutes.  Add cake mix, 1 cup flour, eggs, oil, and salt; beat well.  Stir in remaining flour until a soft dough forms.\nKnead on well floured surface for about 5 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, and turn to coat the dough surface.  Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPunch down, and divide into two equal parts.  Roll out each section on a lightly floured surface.  Spread each with softened butter and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.\nRoll up like jelly rolls and cut buns 1 1/2 inches thick with a piece of dental floss or a dull knife.  Place in greased baking pans, and allow to rise until doubled.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown.\nMeanwhile, combine confectioners sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, vanilla, and milk. Remove baked buns from oven and drizzle with frosting.",
