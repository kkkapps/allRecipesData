Pat shrimp dry with paper towels.\nCombine flour, lemon pepper seasoning, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne together in a bowl. Whisk eggs and milk together in a second bowl.\nDip each shrimp in the egg mixture, then the flour mixture to evenly coat. Transfer prepared shrimp to a baking sheet until ready to fry. Sprinkle additional flour as needed to fully cover.\nCook 8 to 10 shrimp at a time in the hot oil until golden brown on the outside and cooked through on the inside, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining shrimp.\nToss shrimp together with hot sauce in a large bowl until each piece is coated.",
