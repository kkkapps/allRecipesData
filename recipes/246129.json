Add chicken, cover, and cook just until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes.\nStir red pepper, green pepper, onion, fish sauce, sugar, garlic, and basil into the curry mixture. Replace cover; cook until vegetables are just cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Stir in flour to thicken to desired consistency.",
