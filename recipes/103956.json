    "des": "\"I had a friend that had brought me some orange roughy fish one time. Hence the name, I decided to prepare this fish in a citrus marinade. Turned out tender and flaky. Very delectable. Can also be grilled.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, stir together the orange juice concentrate, lemon juice, lime juice, garlic, onion and herb seasoning and lemon-herb seasoning. Pour into a resealable bag and add fish fillets. Seal and marinate the fish for a couple of hours or overnight in the refrigerator.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange the fish fillets in a single layer in a shallow baking dish. Pour the marinade in with them and cover tightly with aluminum foil.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is cooked through.",
