Chop pineapple, asparagus, and halloumi cheese into bite-size pieces and place in a bowl. Add black beans, red bell pepper, and red onion and toss until salad is mixed.\nPlace corn cob in a large bowl and holding the top, slice halfway down to remove kernels from cob. Go all the way around the cob and turn upside down to cut the remaining kernels. Repeat with remaining cobs. Add corn to the salad.\nRemove the stem and charred skin from jalapeno pepper and place jalapeno in a blender. Add tomatoes, lemon juice, lime juice, olive oil, honey, garlic, and salt; blend until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over salad; toss and refrigerate until flavors blend, about 1 hour.",
