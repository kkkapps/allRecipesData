    "des": "\"Slow cooked shredded ham in a brown sugar and mustard sauce. This is the sort of thing you prepare a day or so in advance so that when you serve it you don't really have to do much of anything at all. Great for times when people will be in and out, eating irregularly all day.\"",
    "ins": "Place the ham in a large pot or slow cooker, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 8 to 10 hours. Remove the meat from the water, and allow to cool. If it has cooked long enough, it will fall into pieces as you pick it up.\nPull the ham apart into shreds once it is cool enough to handle. It doesn't have to be tiny shreds. Place the shredded ham into a slow cooker. Stir in the mustard and brown sugar, cover, and set to Low. Cook just until heated. Serve on dinner rolls. We don't use any other sandwich toppings with it, but that is a personal choice.",
