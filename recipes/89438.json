    "des": "\"This dish was created out of boredom with plain, average green beans! It's sweet, tangy and savory...and my kids absolutely love it! Hope you enjoy it as much as we do! I use leftover sliced deli ham since it is already sliced thin and makes perfect tiny pieces, but leftover dinner ham would be delicious also!\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and ham; cook and stir until brown bits start to show up on the bottom of your pan, 5 to 10 minutes.\nMix the red wine vinegar into the pan, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. The vinegar will evaporate quickly - don't panic. Mix in the mustard, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the green beans and stir to coat. Cook just until tender but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Season with kosher salt and serve.",
