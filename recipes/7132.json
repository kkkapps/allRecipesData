    "ins": "In a small saucepan, heat sour cream until very hot. Add salt, sugar, and melted butter. Cool until lukewarm.\nIn a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Mix in sour cream mixture, eggs, flour, and chives. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets or line them with parchment paper.\nDivide dough into 4 parts; shape each piece into a ball. Cover dough rounds with plastic wrap when not working with them.\nRoll a ball into a 10-inch circle. Let dough rest while you roll out another circle. Cut first circle into 12 thin pie-shaped pieces. Starting at the wide end, roll up each triangle, ending with the point. Curl the edges in toward the point. Place point-side down on prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Allow crescent rolls to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.",
