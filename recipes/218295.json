    "des": "\"My family is from Chicago. This is one of my grandma's best recipes that's been handed down. Kids love it because of the cheese cubes! It's a great potluck dish because it has a lot of color! I use salad macaroni because of its small size.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the salad macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, and rinse with cold water until chilled. Drain again to remove excess water.\nPlace macaroni, broccoli, Cheddar cheese, green pepper, pickle relish, dill pickle, celery, black olives, green olives, green onion, carrot, and pimento in a salad bowl, and toss lightly to combine. In a bowl, whisk together the light mayonnaise, mustard, salt, sugar, and black pepper to make a smooth dressing; pour the dressing over the salad, and lightly mix to coat all ingredients with dressing. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to blend flavors before serving.",
