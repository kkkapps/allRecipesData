    "des": "\"These are moist and delicious despite the fact that there is no liquid other than the berry juice.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, combine the strawberries and 1/2 cup sugar. Set aside for 1 hour. Drain, reserving liquid and berries separately.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin tin, or line with paper liners.\nIn a medium bowl, cream together the butter and 1/4 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the juice from the berries. Gently stir in the berries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.\nBake for 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops spring back when lightly touched. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.",
