    "des": "\"I discovered Ham and Pea Soup at a renaissance fair and proceeded home. This recipe is the closest that I came to.  Even my brother, who hates onions and celery, loved this.  Because it makes so much, we tend to cook it only on the holidays. It takes a while to cook, but it is delicious and simple.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into pieces when cool.\nReduce heat to medium-low and add bacon grease to the pot. Add celery and onion; cook and stir until starting to brown. Slowly pour in water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook until vegetables are soft, about 1 hour.\nReturn bacon pieces to the pot. Sprinkle in thyme, sage, onion powder, parsley, and white pepper; stir to combine. Add cubed ham; simmer soup for flavors to combine, about 30 minutes.\nStir peas into the soup; cook until very tender and they start to disintegrate into the soup, about 30 minutes.",
