    "des": "\"This cake has been passed down from generation to generation of the Lucas family. My grandfather gave it to me where he got it from his mother Helen, who got it from her sister Janet and so on. In this recipe there are caraway seeds that make it so unique.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round pans. Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Set aside.\nBeat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the caraway seeds; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter evenly into the 2 pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
