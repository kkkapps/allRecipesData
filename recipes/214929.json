    "des": "\"These parsnips are a winning recipe whether you've liked parsnips in the past or not. I experimented with this recipe to try to make parsnips more enjoyable for folks who previously didn't enjoy them. This one is good for a sodium restricted diet. It tastes like you're cheating that diet but you won't be. Enjoy.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the turkey bacon in the hot oil until almost crisp. Add the parsnips, onion, and chopped pecans. Cook and stir until the parsnips are almost tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar and vinegar; continue to cook until the parsnips are tender, 3 to 4 minutes more.",
