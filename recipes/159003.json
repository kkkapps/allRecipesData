    "des": "\"No need for a bun with these crispy flakes.  The dogs are rolled in ketchup and mustard, then rolled in cornflake crumbs and baked. This is easy and delicious - kids love them! I grew up with these as my mother was diabetic and needed to cut down on bread (buns) so she made us kids these instead. For something different, try adding some Parmesan cheese to corn flake crumb mixture.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a sheet of aluminum foil.\nStir together ketchup and mustard on a plate until mixed. Place the cornflake crumbs in a shallow bowl. Roll each hot dog in the ketchup mixture, then roll in the cornflake crumbs to coat. Place onto prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until the hot dogs are hot on the inside, and crispy on the outside, 15 to 20 minutes.",
