    "des": "\"What a tasty way to eat your greens! Baby kale is saut\u00c3\u00a9ed with caramelized onions, toasted pine nuts and golden raisins for a quick, healthy side dish. I often eat this over rice for a main meal. Baby spinach is an easy substitute.\"",
    "ins": "Place pine nuts in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until toasted and fragrant, about 2 minutes.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook, stirring often, until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir, about 1 minute. Stir in baby kale a few handfuls at a time until it starts to wilt. Cover and cook until kale is completely wilted and hot, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nRemove from heat and stir in pine nuts and golden raisins. Cool briefly before serving, about 5 minutes.",
