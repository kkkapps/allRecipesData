    "ins": "Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats.\nWhisk eggs whites and lemon juice together in a bowl until thick, white, and foamy. Add sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking constantly, until meringue is shiny, thick, and holds its shape.\nTransfer meringue to a piping bag. Pipe 12 bone shapes onto a prepared baking sheet. Pipe 12 puffs to resemble ghosts onto the remaining baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until dried and firm, about 1 hour. Turn off the oven, close the door, and cool until completely dried, about 1 hour more.\nDip the tip of a toothpick into melted chocolate and dot chocolate \"eyes\" on each of the ghosts.",
