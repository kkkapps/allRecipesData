    "des": "\"Hearty and tasty, this recipe is simple and the stew tastes great heated up a second (or third) time. The onion can be omitted for those allergic to such things. Boneless lamb shoulder can be cut into cubes if your butcher doesn't have lamb cut for stew.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium heat, mix the beef broth, lamb, parsley, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and cook 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nStir potatoes, carrots, and onion into the lamb mixture. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook 90 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender.\nIn a small bowl, mix the flour and oil until smooth. Stir into the stew mixture, and cook 5 minutes, until thickened.",
