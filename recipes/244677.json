    "des": "\"This creamy dip is great for all things potato (fries and chips especially) and also makes a great steak dip. It's even good spread on a roast beef sandwich!  Everyone loves it, and no one can guess what's in it. The combination of the two ingredients is surprisingly different than either alone. I strongly encourage using Kikkoman\u00c2\u00ae soy sauce, as other brands I have tried tasted very different and not nearly as good.\"",
