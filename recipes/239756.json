    "des": "\"I am not a vegan or vegetarian but still really enjoy this recipe. It is similar to one I found on a vegetarian website, however, I made my own additions and now it is amazing! These are an awesome side dish or main dish! They can be served with Parmesan cheese, red or green hot sauce, or olive tapenade, but these are also great by themselves!\"",
