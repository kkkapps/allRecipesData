    "des": "\"My husband came up with this creation for Easter dinner, as Tilapia is indigenous to the sea of Galilee.  It remains the best fish I have ever put in my mouth, absolutely beyond restaurant quality.\"",
    "ins": "Beat the eggs with the lemon pepper and garlic pepper until blended; set aside. Stir together ground almonds with 1 cup of Parmesan cheese in a shallow dish until combined; set aside. Dust the tilapia fillets with flour, and shake off excess. Dip the tilapia in egg, then press into the almond mixture.\nMelt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia in melted butter until golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium, and season fillets with salt if desired. Sprinkle the tilapia with the remaining Parmesan cheese, cover, and continue cooking until the Parmesan cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer the tilapia to a serving dish, and garnish with parsley springs and lemon wedges to serve.",
