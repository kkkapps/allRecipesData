Drain on paper towels; chop into smaller pieces.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nArrange potato chips in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle bacon and cheese curds evenly on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese curds start to melt and chips start to brown around the edges, about 4 minutes. Top with pepperoncini peppers and black pepper. Let cool. Transfer to a serving bowl.",
