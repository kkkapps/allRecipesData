    "des": "\"I threw this together one afternoon, as we needed to use up the venison we had in our freezer. We don't like the 'gamey' taste of some meats, and this marinade did the trick! I find it best to have the meat marinate overnight so it really takes in the flavors.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, onion, red pepper flakes, dry mustard, salt, thyme, black pepper, garlic, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add venison steaks, coat with the marinade, squeeze to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove venison from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.\nCook the steaks until they are firm, hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).",
