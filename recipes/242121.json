    "des": "\"I am trying to lose weight and start a healthier lifestyle, but honestly don't like health food; I like comfort foods. So, the goal here was to develop a comfort food using quinoa and a few simple ingredients for a quick dinner that has more nutrients than the average mac-n-cheese. I'm happy with my results on this one. It may not be the creme de la creme of yummy health foods, but it is easy. And when I say easy, I mean it.  As a career woman with a hungry husband, I need to keep things as basic and quick as possible, while catering to a picky husband-kid. Cut with spatula and serve in squares. Enjoy!\"",

Pour the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish; top with layers of mozzarella cheese and Cheddar cheese, respectively.\nCook in preheated oven until cheese is completely melted, about 15 minutes.",
