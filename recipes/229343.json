    "des": "\"This one-dish meal doesn't have anything to do with Chinese food. Originating more than a century ago in Canada, it came from Chinese immigrants making do with ingredients from their new environment. This is a wonderful comfort food dish that is a family favorite. Kids love this dish! Serve with a green salad and some nice crusty rolls.\"",
