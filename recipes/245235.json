    "ins": "In a food processor, combine the shallots, vinegar, lemon juice, maple syrup, olive oil, salt and pepper and blend until smooth. Set aside.\nLine a small baking sheet with Reynolds Wrap\u00c2\u00ae Aluminum Foil. Set aside.\nIn a non-stick pan over medium heat, combine the hazelnuts, sugar and cayenne. Stir with a silicone spatula until the sugar has melted and sticks to the nuts, about 5 minutes; turn down the heat to prevent burning if needed. Spread the sticky nuts out on the foil-lined sheet to cool. When the nuts are cool enough to handle, break them up by hand.\nStem the kale and chop well. Using a mandoline, shred the Brussels sprouts, discarding the tough ends. Combine both in a large salad bowl. Add the hazelnuts, quinoa, pomegranate seeds, green onions and cheese. Dress to your liking and serve immediately.",
