    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSeason pork chops with garlic powder and seasoned salt.\nBeat eggs in a bowl until smooth. Pour flour into a separate shallow bowl and bread crumbs into a third bowl.\nGently press seasoned pork chops into the flour to coat and shake to remove excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded chops onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.\nCook pork chops in hot oil until the bread crumb coating is well browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a baking dish. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.\nBake chops in preheated oven for 1 hour. Whisk cream of chicken soup, milk, and pesto together in a bowl; pour over the pork chops. Replace foil and continue baking another 30 minutes.",
