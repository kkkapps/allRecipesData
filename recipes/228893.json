    "des": "\"I invented this while goofing around in the kitchen. It ended up being a hit with my family! If the veggies are steamed tender-crisp before being thrown in the pan, it cuts the cooking time in half and makes it a quick healthy lunch! Serve warm, topped with toasted sesame seeds.\"",

Set aside.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; add onion. Cook and stir until onion is softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.\nStir cooked broccoli, cauliflower, edamame, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, and garlic into the pan; cook and stir until vegetables are cooked through, about 5 minutes.\nStir in reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce and agave nectar; cook 5 more minutes.",
