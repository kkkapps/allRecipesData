    "des": "\"These vegetarian balls can be served as a main dish or appetizer.  As a main dish, serve with white or brown rice.  As an appetizer, they are delicious dipped in tomato-ey sauce of any kind (ketchup, barbeque, salsa).  In the rare event that there are leftovers, the balls take on a great texture when reheated in marinara sauce and are good served with pasta.\"",
    "ins": "Pick through the split peas removing rocks, then rinse.  Soak, covered by 2-inches of water until soft enough to be broken with your fingernail, 3 hours to overnight.\nWhen soft, drain peas, then puree in 1 cup batches in a food processor or blender until smooth along with the garlic, curry powder, salt, and serrano pepper.  Add water as needed to make a thick paste.  Sift baking powder and 1/2 cup of flour into a large bowl then stir in the pea puree , adding additional flour to make a stiff batter.\nHeat 2 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or deep, heavy skillet over medium-high heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nDrop batter by the teaspoonful into the hot oil in batches of about 10.  Turn balls when they float and their bottoms turn brown, and continue cooking to brown the other side, about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with additional salt if desired.",
