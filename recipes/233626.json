    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCombine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and melted butter in a mixing bowl; mix until evenly moistened and press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the crust is lightly browned and smells toasted, about 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool.\nSoak gelatin in cold water for 3 minutes. Heat the water and gelatin in the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, stirring frequently, until gelatin is completely dissolved.\nBeat whipping cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form.\nStir strawberries and 1/3 cup sugar together in a bowl. Pour gelatin mixture over strawberries. Gently fold in whipped cream until incorporated. Pour filling into baked pie shell and chill in the refrigerator until set, at least 2 hours.",
