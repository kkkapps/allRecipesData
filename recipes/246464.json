    "des": "\"In this classic Italian dessert, sweet, juicy fruit is enveloped in a rich but impossibly light custard.\"",
    "ins": "Gently stir the strawberries and sugar together in a bowl. Cover and let sit at room temperature until juices release, about 1 hour.\nDivide fruit between 2 small, clear serving bowls or stemmed cocktail glasses.\nPlace egg yolks, sugar, and marsala into metal mixing bowl. Set over burner on low heat. Hold rim of bowl with a potholder. Whisk until mixture forms loose peaks, 7 or 8 minutes. Mixture should feel warm to the touch.\nSpoon custard over the strawberries. Serve while custard is still warm.",
