    "des": "\"This simple topping turns an average salad into something above and beyond! I pair these with my sweet sour salad dressing and they make an amazing salad!\n I like to make up a big batch of these and keep them on-hand in an airtight container to use as a salad topper. I like to toast my almonds to a nice medium-brown, they take on a bolder flavor and really mix well in any salad.\"",
    "ins": "Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.\nCook and stir almonds and sugar in a skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar melts and almonds turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer almonds to the prepared baking sheet to cool completely.",
