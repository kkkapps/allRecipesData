    "ins": "Whisk together the raspberry vinaigrette, maple syrup, and soy sauce in a large bowl. Stir in the venison until well coated, and set aside.\nBring the butter, olive oil, water, onions, and garlic to a boil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until the onions have caramelized to a deep, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Once the onions have turned dark golden brown, stir in the sugar, and cook 2 to 3 minutes more.\nStir in the venison along with the marinade. Cook and stir until the venison is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.",
