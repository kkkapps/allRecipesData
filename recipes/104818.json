    "des": "\"This sauce adds a very nice flavor to mashed potatoes, and the combination goes very well along with steak. To reduce the amount of fat in the sauce I like to use evaporated milk. You can use cream instead, but I think the lower-fat-version is just as tasty!\"",
    "ins": "Warm the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir in the onion, and cook until nearly tender.  Stir in the garlic, and cook for a few seconds, until fragrant.  Pour in peas, and stir to thaw.  Pour in the vegetable stock and evaporated milk.  Turn heat to low, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.  Once the peas have cooked, pour them into a blender and puree until smooth.\nPour the pureed sauce back into the skillet, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Simmer over low heat until the sauce reaches desired consistency.",
