    "des": "\"Turkey loaf is a mainstay of our budget meals.  I make it once a week, changing the ingredients often to tweak the family's appetites!  This is the latest version, well received.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 7 1/2 by 3 3/4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.\nWith a fork, break the turkey meat into chunks in a bowl. Add egg, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, celery, red onion, bread crumbs, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, seasoned salt, and black pepper; mix thoroughly with hands. Gently pat the mixture into the prepared loaf pan, leaving a small space between the meat mixture and the sides of the pan. Spread chili sauce over the meat loaf.\nBake in the preheated oven until the juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads 160 degrees F/70 degrees C, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.",
