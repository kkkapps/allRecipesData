    "ins": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\nWhisk together the hoisin sauce, sherry, tangerine zest, and ground ginger in a small bowl.\nHeat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat.  Add one half of the beef slices to the pan; cook, stirring constantly, until the meat is nicely browned, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove meat to a platter with a slotted spoon.  Repeat with the remaining beef.\nHeat the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil in the pan.  Stir in the butternut squash, mushrooms, and onion.  Cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are crisp-tender and slightly brown on the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.  Add the cabbage, and cook and stir until slightly wilted, about 2 additional minutes.\nReduce the heat to medium.  Stir the cooked beef, tangerine sections, and hoisin mixture into the vegetables.  Cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve over Chinese noodles.",
