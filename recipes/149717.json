    "des": "\"These are inspired by a dim sum item I had from a fancy Asian-fusion restaurant in Manhattan. They're delicious served with a simple broth and have a silky, savory edamame filling inside. They are time consuming, but relatively easy to make. You can make them ahead of time and freeze them for future use. The dumplings are meant to be steamed or boiled but taste great deep fried as well. Garnish with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and sliced green onion.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add edamame and boil for 10 minutes; drain. Rinse with cold water.\nPlace edamame in a food processor; turn processor on to low. Drizzle in 1/4 cup water and olive oil while continuing to process until combined. Turn off the food processor and add the sour cream, salt, pepper, green onion, garlic, lemon juice, and hot sauce. Process until mixture is smooth.\nPlace 1 teaspoon of the mixture in the center of each won ton wrapper. Bring 2 opposite corners of the wrapper together to form a triangle; pinch the edges closed. Bring farthest corners of the triangle together and overlap one another. Use a little bit of water on the corners and pinch them together to ensure they stay together.\nStir together 6 cups water and the bouillon cubes in a large, deep skillet over medium heat; bring to a gentle boil. Lay the wontons in the water, assuring they don't touch one another; cook until tender, about 5 minutes; plate. Ladle broth from skillet over won tons to serve.",
