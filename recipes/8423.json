Add egg yolks and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Beat well. Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt. Add to butter mixture alternately with milk. Pour into two 8 inch round cake pans.\nWash and dry beaters and bowl thoroughly. In a large, bowl beat egg whites, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and the rum extract until soft peaks form.

About 1 to 2 hours before serving, make the filling: Combine whipping cream, confectioners sugar, and the remaining vanilla. Beat until soft peaks form.
