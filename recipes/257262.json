Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nCombine cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, heavy cream, and strawberry jam in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy.\nSlice off the sides of 8 strawberries to remove seeds.

Fill each gap with a spoonful of the cream cheese frosting.\nTop each cupcake with a swirl of whipped cream. Place 1 strawberry slice in the center of each cupcake.",
