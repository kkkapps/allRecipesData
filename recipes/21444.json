    "des": "\"This is a full-flavored, pungent, yet subtle special occasion dish.   We served the meal with diced, spiced new potatoes with chopped onions baked in foil for 40 minutes, and a Caesar salad.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nTo make the apple stuffing: In a saute pan or skillet on medium heat, melt the butter and saute thyme, chopped apples, salt and pepper together until the apples are completely softened; about 15 to 20 minutes.\nPlace the apple mixture in a bowl and mix in 1/4 cup Gorgonzola cheese.  The cheese should liquefy into the stuffing within a couple of minutes.\nTo prepare the pork chops: Butterfly the pork chops by slicing them parallel to the plane of the chop from the fat side to the bone.  Stuff each one with about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the apple mixture.\nBake the chops for about 1 hour.  Place the chops on a rack with the two stuffing sides pressed together to hold the stuffing inside the chops.\nTo make the sauce: Heat the oil in a saute pan or skillet on medium heat, then saute the garlic until transparent, and the cheese until slightly melting.  Immediately add the sherry, let cook for a minute until combined, then add the cream and 1/4 cup of the chicken stock, salt and pepper.  Stir until well blended.  Stir occasionally and reduce the liquid on medium high heat until the sauce begins to toast/caramelize and turn darker brown.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup chicken stock, reincorporate the cheese and continue reducing until there is just 1/4 to 1/2 cup of thick liquid remaining.",
