    "des": "\"Give your Thanksgiving dinner a twist this year.  You will be pleasantly surprised at the indescribable flavor of this turkey.  Well, WOW comes to mind. I got the general recipe from a German friend of mine with an added twist of my own.  I have had so many raves about my turkey that everyone now comes to my house on Thanksgiving.  Definitely a crowd pleaser, there has never been left over turkey at my house. Thanks Evelyn :)\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRinse the turkey, pat dry and place in a large roasting pan. Insert the onion, carrot, and celery into the cavity of the bird.  Poke holes in the apple and orange so they will release their juices, and stuff them into the bird. You may have to cut some things in half to get them all inside. Spread oil all over the outside of the bird, and season with salt, pepper and soul food seasoning.\nPlace the turkey into an oven bag, and set back into the pan with the breast facing up. Lay strips of bacon over the entire top. Close the bag.\nRoast the turkey for about 4 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) when taken in the thickest part of the thigh. Let the turkey rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving, and use the drippings in your favorite gravy recipe.",
