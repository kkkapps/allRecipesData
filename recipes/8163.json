Fold into other mixture. Pour into prepared cake pans.\nBake approximately 30 minutes or until top springs back when lightly touched. Cool and frost.\nTo make frosting: mix 4 egg yolks until they are broken up and smooth, add 1/2 cup evaporated milk and mix together until the eggs yolks are mixed well with milk. Add rest of evaporated milk, 2 cups sugar, and 1/2 cup butter. Cook until thick and remove from heat. Stir in 2 cups nuts, 2 cups raisins, and 2 cups coconut.
