    "des": "\"The coconut oil gave it it great light taste! My husband said it was the best fish! You can use tilapia too, just cut down the cooking time as it's a much smaller fillet. The swai fillets was much bigger and 2 fed us both quite well! Serve with lemon.\"",
    "ins": "Place stuffing mix in a blender and pulse until crumbly; mix with pecans and Parmesan cheese on a plate.\nCombine cornstarch and flour on a separate plate, mixing with a fork. Beat egg in a shallow bowl.\nPreheat an electric skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) or over medium-high heat; add coconut oil.\nPat swai fish dry with a paper towel. Press fillets, 1 at a time, in the flour mixture, shaking off excess. Dip each fillet in the egg, allowing excess to drip back onto plate; press into stuffing mixture until evenly coated.\nCook fillets in the hot coconut oil until lightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.",
