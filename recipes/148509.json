    "des": "\"This is an easy vegan falafel using dried garbanzo beans and ingredients you already have in your cupboard. No eggs or bread crumbs either as filler--just tasty falafel! Serve with tzatziki and typical falafel fare such as lettuce, tomato, and cucumber. It's not much more work than using canned beans, but the taste is phenomenal and authentic.\"",
    "ins": "Rinse the garbanzo beans under cold water and discard any bad ones. Place in a large pot, and cover with water. Let soak 24 hours, and rinse again.\nPlace the garbanzo beans, onion, and potato in the bowl of a food processor. Cover, and process until finely chopped. Leaving about 1 cup of the garbanzo bean mixture in the food processor bowl, pour the rest into a mixing bowl. Add the garlic, cilantro, coriander, cumin, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to the garbanzo bean mixture in the food processor bowl; process on low to blend thoroughly. Return the reserved garbanzo bean mixture to the food processor bowl, and add the lemon juice, olive oil, and flour; process on low into a coarse meal. Cover, and refrigerate 2 hours.\nStir the baking soda into the garbanzo bean mixture until evenly blended. Using damp hands, form the mixture into 1 1/2  inch diameter balls.\nPour the canola oil into a wok 1 to 2 inches deep, and heat over medium-high heat. Cook the falafel balls, turning so all sides are evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove falafel from oil, and drain on paper towels. Repeat to cook remaining falafel balls.",
