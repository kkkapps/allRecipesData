    "ins": "Stir sugar and vinegar in a large microwave-safe bowl until sugar has dissolved; mix in salt, mustard seed, celery seed, and turmeric. Stir cucumbers and onion into the pickling mixture.\nMicrowave on high, stirring twice, until cucumber slices are tender and onion is translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Chill before serving.",
