    "des": "\"This is a great potato casserole for the grill.  Clean up can't get any easier than just tossing the foil!  These can also be baked in a 350 degree oven if space on the grill is at a premium.  Don't be tempted to skip the celery seed, it's what makes these unique.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.\nMelt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the flour, salt, seasoned pepper, and celery seed; cook and stir for 1 minute. Gradually whisk the milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick and bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes.\nStir in the potatoes, onion, and green bell pepper. Pour the potato mixture onto a large sheet of heavy duty foil. Sprinkle with paprika. Fold the foil loosely around the potato mixture and seal tightly. Grill on covered grill, turning the packets every 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender, about 45 to 50 minutes.",
