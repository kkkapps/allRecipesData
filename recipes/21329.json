    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.  Meanwhile, place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 2 to 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.\nMash the potatoes with milk and salt.  Brush a deep 9 inch pie dish with olive oil and press the potatoes in.  Brush with remaining olive oil.    Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until lightly browned.\nArrange onions, broccoli and cheese in the potato crust.  Whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Pour over broccoli and cheese.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until slightly puffed and cooked throughout.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
