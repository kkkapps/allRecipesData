    "des": "\"I use this recipe quite often on a spiced pound cake it compliments quite well. My grandparents love it; I make it with cake every time I visit them. This is a basic buttercream recipe with rum extract and a few extra spices added to it. I prefer a stronger rum flavor, so you should adjust the amount of rum extract to your liking.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk butter in a large bowl until fluffy. Gradually add 1 cup of the sifted confectioners' sugar, beating well. Slowly beat in the salt and cream. Gradually beat in the remaining 2 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar. Continue to beat until the frosting begins to thicken; whisk in the vanilla and rum extracts, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. Allow to sit for 15 minutes before using.",
