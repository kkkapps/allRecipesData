    "des": "\"This lamb shank recipe was initially given to me as a family favorite from a work buddy.  I've prepared it in a slow cooker and made it as easy as possible to prepare.  It has a fantastic flavour and the meat just falls off the bone.  I have made this in the oven as well and doubled the quantities for 4 people and it tasted just as good, only everybody went in for seconds and there were no leftovers.\"",
    "ins": "Stir the sour cream and all-purpose flour together in a small bowl until smooth and set aside. In a separate small bowl, mix together the cornstarch and water to make a paste.\nCombine the chili powder, coriander, ginger, bouillon cubes, cardamom, tomatoes, water, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Slowly add the cornstarch paste to the tomato mixture, stirring constantly; simmer for 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and slowly stir in the sour cream and flour mixture.\nArrange the onions across the bottom of a slow cooker, lay the shanks on top of the onions and pour the prepared tomato mixture over the meat. Place the carrots, potatoes and mushrooms on top of the sauce.\nCover and cook in the slow cooker on High for 8 hours.",
