    "des": "\"A realistic shocker of a cookie. These look like cat poop and are served in a tidy litter box setting. Mix and match the additions of chocolate or butterscotch chips, ramen noodles (roundworms), coconut (tapeworms), corn or peanuts depending on what effects you want to achieve.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, heat honey in the microwave until bubbly, about 1 minute. Stir in the butter until melted. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the wheat flour and cocoa; stir into the batter until well blended. Cover dough and chill in the freezer for 1 hour or several hours in the refrigerator.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough into small logs of random length and shape like poops. Roll the poops in the nugget cereal and place them 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of nugget cereal, with a cat litter scoop. I hear you get lovely effects by decorating the box and scoop with melted chocolate or pudding",
