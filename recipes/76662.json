Rice and/or tortillas plus salad greens, sliced avocado, and chopped tomatoes round out a simple but special meal.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and cook the onion until tender. Mix in cocoa powder, cumin, cilantro, and garlic. Stir in the tomato soup and green chile peppers. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 10 minutes. Transfer to a gravy boat or pour directly over food to serve.",
