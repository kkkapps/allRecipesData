    "des": "\"Now that the peach season is here, this recipe is really good for using those fresh peaches. When the season is over, just use canned peaches for the same delicious bread. This was a big hit at our Tennis Round Robin Day. I like using a mixture of walnuts and hazelnuts.\"",

Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.
