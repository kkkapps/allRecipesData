    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tomatoes and cook uncovered until peels start to break, about 10 seconds. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain and slip skins off each tomato.\nCombine tomatoes, celery, and olives in a bowl; pour in enough vodka to completely cover. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight. Strain and sprinkle celery salt over tomato mixture.",
