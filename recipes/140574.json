    "des": "\"Hoe cake is a Southern bread that is cooked in an iron skillet, like cornbread.  This recipe stems back to my great-great grandmother.  My father has made this recipe for years, and it is always requested from his grandchildren.  A slice of hoe cake will warm your insides -- slathered with some homemade apple butter alongside of some butter beans, freshly sliced tomatoes and a good tall glass of sweet tea.  I promise your family will love this truly Southern recipe!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a well-seasoned cast iron skillet with the shortening, and place it in the oven as it heats.\nWhisk together the flour and milk in a bowl, to make a thick but still runny batter.\nRemove the hot greased skillet from the preheated oven, and quickly sprinkle a pinch of garlic salt over the bottom of the skillet. Immediately pour in the batter, and sprinkle the top with a pinch of garlic salt.\nReturn the skillet to the oven, and bake in the preheated oven until the cake has risen and the top is golden brown, about 20 minutes.",
