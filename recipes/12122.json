Stir in salt, corn syrup and melted butter mixture. Add coffee powder mixed with 1 teaspoon water, if desired. Stir in the chopped pecans.\nSpread chocolate chips evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.  Pour pecan mixture over the crust.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes, or until set.  Cover and let stand at room temperature about 8 hours before serving.  Pie will be soft.\nCombine cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla in a small mixing bowl.  Whip until stiff.  Garnish pie.",
