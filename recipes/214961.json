    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nCombine chevre cheese, milk, and honey in a small bowl.\nGrill the peaches cut sides down until peaches begin to caramelize and show grill marks, 5 to 7 minutes. Fill each peach half with 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture. Garnish with a mint leaf, and serve warm.",
