Bake in preheated 350 degree F oven (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes.\nVariation for a White Cake: Prepare as for the basic cake except use 3 egg whites for the 2 whole eggs. Whites may be beaten separately and added for a lighter cake.\nVariation for a Chocolate Cake: Add 1/4 cup cocoa powder to the basic cake mix prior to adding the milk.\nVariation for a Spice Cake: Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice to the basic cake mix.\nVariation for a Pineapple Upside Down Cake: Melt 1/2 cup butter in the bottom of a 9x13 pan.
