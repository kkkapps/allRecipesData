    "des": "\"I found a recipe here that I ended up changing so much it hardly resembled what I started out with, and my family LOVED them. I thought it would be a nice addition. These pancakes are a blend of good and not-so-good-for-you ingredients, hence the name.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.\nPour milk and vanilla extract into the well; add beaten eggs. Mix wet and dry ingredients together until smooth.\nGrease a skillet with oil and heat over medium heat.\nPour 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into the hot skillet; cook until bottom is golden brown and there are many small pinholes in the top of the pancake, about 2 minutes. Flip pancake and continue cooking until golden brown and the middle of the pancake is set, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing skillet with oil between pancakes as needed.",
