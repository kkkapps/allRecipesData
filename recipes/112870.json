    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees.\nPut yogurt in a small bowl, and set aside.  In a shallow pie plate, combine coconut, panko and pecans.\nDip chicken strips in yogurt to cover, then roll in panko mixture.  Place strips on an oil-sprayed baking sheet.  Spray top of chicken.  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350, and bake 15 more minutes.  Check that coating browns but does not burn.  If desired, broil 2 minutes for an even crunchier top.",
