    "des": "\"This is a family favorite and easy to prepare in the slow cooker. The chicken has a bite to it but one can control the heat by limiting the amount of hot pepper sauce used. Even if you don't like very hot food, include a few drops for flavor. (For the ham, I get the deli to slice about a one inch section of Virginia Ham).\"",
