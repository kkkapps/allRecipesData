    "des": "\"These wontons make a good snack or an appetizer. If you can't handle a regular jalapeno popper but still like jalapenos this is a good substitute. You can make them as spicy as you want. You can even make them ahead of time and stick them in the freezer!\"",

Mix well.\nWhisk egg and water together in a small bowl.\nPlace 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture on a wonton wrapper. Brush the edges of the wonton wrappers with the egg mixture using a small pastry brush. Fold wonton into a triangle; pinch shut. Repeat with the rest of the wonton wrappers.\nPlace wontons carefully in the oil, working in batches. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 6 minutes.",
