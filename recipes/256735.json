    "des": "\"Whether you are following an AIP diet, you're intolerant to grains, or you simply want to switch up the taste of your breakfast porridge with a great and creamy texture, this healthy grain-free recipe is perfect for you! \n\nThis vanilla-maca tapioca porridge with a rhubarb and raspberry sauce is definitely one of my favorite grain-free porridge alternatives. As you probably saw on my Facebook and Instagram, I make it very often! What I love about this recipe is that is suitable pretty for anybody as I worked very hard to make it compliant to basically every allergy in the world.\"",
    "ins": "Grease a saucepan with coconut oil and place over medium heat; add rhubarb. Cook until rhubarb starts to soften, adding water if needed, about 10 minutes. Stir raspberries and 1 packet stevia powder into rhubarb; cook until sauce is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.\nFill a pot halfway with water and bring to a boil; add tapioca. Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until tapioca is completely translucent, 5 to 8 minutes.\nBlend coconut milk, dates, maca powder, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth.\nStrain tapioca porridge through a fine-mesh strainer and transfer back to the pot over low heat. Stir coconut mixture and 1 packet stevia powder into porridge. Simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more.\nPour porridge into 3 wine glasses and top with raspberry-rhubarb sauce.",
