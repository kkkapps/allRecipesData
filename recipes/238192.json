    "des": "\"A shortbread I created for strawberry shortcake or even peach shortcake. The size and shape of these are really up to you. Baking time can vary; you are looking for a golden brown top.\"",

Cut cold butter pieces into flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Fold cream cheese into butter mixture.\nStir a small amount of the 3/4 cup milk into cream cheese mixture, continuing to add milk until the dough is sticky.
