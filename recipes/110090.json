    "des": "\"This is a delicious version of a grilled salmon using cedar planks that have been soaked in water overnight to add smokiness and flavor to the salmon.\"",
    "ins": "Soak the cedar planks in water for several hours or overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Brush the planks with olive oil.\nCut the salmon fillet into three portions. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle parsley and sun-dried tomatoes over the top. Drizzle with salad dressing.\nPlace the planks on the preheated grill and let them heat up for about 5 minutes. Place the salmon fillets on the planks. Cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Fish is done when it can be flaked with a fork. Remove quickly to avoid over cooking and drying out the fish. Serve piping hot.",
