    "des": "\"A recipe my Uncle Drew brought with him when he visited for our family reunion. I think we made about five batches of these rich, chocolaty goodies over the course of his stay! Top the brownie batter with shredded coconut or nuts if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch oven-proof skillet.\nPlace butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Add sugar and cocoa powder to butter and stir. Heat butter-cocoa mixture in microwave until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds.\nMix vanilla extract into butter-cocoa mixture. Stir eggs into butter-cocoa mixture; add flour and stir until batter is well mixed. Pour batter into the prepared skillet.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownies comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.",
