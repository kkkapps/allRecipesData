    "des": "\"Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. While my husband and I eat 1 or 2 each, she easily finishes at least 3! The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal! Extra-lean ground chicken can be substituted with ground turkey with great results.\"",
    "ins": "Mix ground chicken, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, onion, egg, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Moisten hands and shape chicken mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, into flat, oval-shaped patties.\nSpread remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs into a shallow dish. Roll patties in bread crumbs to coat.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\nCook patties in hot oil until deep brown in color on the bottom, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn patties and cook until other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more.",
