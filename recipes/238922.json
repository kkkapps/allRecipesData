    "des": "\"If you're looking for a rich and decadent chocolate pudding then keep moving. As nutritious as this 'superfood' is supposed to be, you can't expect the same results substituting birdseed for eggs, butter, and cream. That said, if you're craving something sweet, relatively chocolaty, and comparatively healthful, then chia seeds may be a good option.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk milk, chia seeds, cocoa powder, brown sugar, white sugar, coffee granules, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until pudding is smooth. Let sit for 5 minutes; stir. Repeat sitting and stirring process at least 2 times.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Spoon into bowls and top with chocolate hemp seeds.",
