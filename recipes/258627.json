    "des": "\"Ebi chili is one of those Japanese dishes which has Chinese influence. It is a shrimp or prawn dish with a sweet and spicy sauce. It's an easy recipe and a favorite bento ingredient for many kids. For this dish I've used fresh prawns, which needed to be cleaned well before cooking. In this recipe, the cooking time is only 3 minutes which makes it a perfect go-to recipe in case of kitchen emergencies.\"",
