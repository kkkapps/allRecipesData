    "des": "\"A great way to use quinoa! It can be used as a crust or flatbread, made into a main dish, side dish, or appetizer! \nThis is one that works well and can be easily changed with the herbs you have on hand or in your garden. We are starting clean-eating this week and tweaked some recipes. This can also be used as a pizza crust, topped with hummus, bruschetta, pesto, or even egg/tofu salad. It's great for any gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, or vegetarian diet.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9-inch round pans with cooking spray.\nPulse quinoa in a food processor until ground into flour, 3 to 5 minutes.\nCombine quinoa flour, water, olive oil, dill, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Whisk, adding more water if needed, until combined. Divide dough evenly between the prepared cake pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until tops are golden, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges.",
