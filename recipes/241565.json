    "des": "\"This my take on the classic 'reuben casserole,' which I love. Try it and add your own variation, depending on your tastes. Different meats, cheeses, breads, or dressings would make for a variety of tastes.\"",
    "ins": "Spread the bread cubes into a shallow pan and let the bread sit until the cut surfaces are somewhat dried with the insides remaining soft, 2 to 3 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.\nPut bread cubes into a large bowl. Pour honey mustard over the bread and mix to coat. Layer about half the bread cubes into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle 2/3 cup Swiss cheese over the bread cubes; top with 1 cup ham. Spread relish in a layer over everything. Layer remaining ham, 2/3 cup Swiss cheese, and remaining bread cubes, respectively, atop the relish layer. Finish by topping with the remaining Swiss cheese. Cover entire dish with aluminum foil.\nBake in preheated oven until hot in the center, about 30 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before cutting to serve.",
