    "des": "\"This is a Sicilian rolled and stuffed roast, simmered in spaghetti sauce. The name as I heard it is pronounced broo-zha-lee-nee. This can also be made in a large slow cooker.\"",
    "ins": "Pound meat as thin as possible, hopefully 1/4 inch thick. Drizzle or brush with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then sprinkle with a thin layer of bread crumbs. Layer the prosciutto over the crumbs, and sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs, and chopped hard-cooked eggs. Roll the meat up into a tight spiral, and secure with kitchen twine.\nHeat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan, or stock pot over medium-high heat. Sear the outside of the roast on all sides. Pour spaghetti sauce over the roast, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.\nRemove meat from the sauce to a serving platter, and let stand for 15 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain.\nCarve the meat into slices about 1/2 inch thick. Serve with spaghetti and sauce.",
