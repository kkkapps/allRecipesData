    "des": "\"Bacon is considered by many (myself included) to be the ice cream of meats. Breading and frying it in oil takes it to a completely new level. I serve these on slider buns as appetizers for parties.\"",
    "ins": "Make the aioli by stirring the mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice, basil, and dill together in a bowl. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Whisk the heavy cream and beaten eggs together in a separate bowl.\nDip each piece of bacon into the egg mixture and then into the flour mixture. Repeat the process a second time to assure each piece is heavily coated.\nFry the bacon in the hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Set aside onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain.\nSpread a generous amount of the aioli onto each roll. Add a slice of tomato to each and season with salt and pepper. Finish the sandwiches with a portion of the lettuce and a few slices of bacon.",
