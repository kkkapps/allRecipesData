    "des": "\"Tortillas filled with a chicken, rice, beans and olive mixture - rolled, fried and topped with a piquant avocado mix, sour cream and cheese, all served on a bed of lettuce. Being raised 12 miles from the border of Mexico, I was brought up on Mexican food and learned how to make many of the dishes.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium saucepan combine the broth, rice, sauce, and 1 diced onion. Mix and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and let simmer for about 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.\nMeanwhile, heat tortillas in a large skillet (so that they are soft enough to fold).\nWhen rice mixture is ready, spoon equal amounts of the following onto each tortilla: Chicken, shredded Jack cheese, diced onion, olives, rice mixture and beans. Roll tortillas, tucking in sides to prevent filling from spilling over.\nHeat oil in a large skillet and fry the filled tortillas, turning, until browned on all sides. Drain on paper towels.\nTo Serve: In a medium bowl combine the avocados, cilantro, lemon juice, green onions, chile peppers and tomatoes. Mash together. Place shredded lettuce on a platter, topped with chimichangas, avocado mix, sour cream and shredded Cheddar cheese.",
