    "des": "\"This recipe was given to me by a friend who made it for a pot-luck at work. It's very easy to make and very tasty, too. I've made it several times and I hope you enjoy this chicken that has a little different twist . Serve with crusty French bread.\"",

Cook chicken breasts, turning occasionally and reducing heat when necessary, 5 minutes per side, or until no longer pink in center and juices run clear.\nAdd thyme, rosemary, garlic, black and green olives, mushrooms, pearl onions, and chicken stock to the skillet. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until chicken is to desired tenderness. Stir in potatoes, peas, and wine.
