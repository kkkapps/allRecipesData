    "ins": "Lightly grease a popover pan and refrigerate. Beat together eggs and milk. Mix in flour and salt and stir until moistened. Ignore any lumps in the batter. Pour batter into chilled pan.\nPlace pan into cold oven. Heat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and bake for 30 minutes, or until popovers have set.",
