But I've had barbeque in some of the best little places in the Carolina's, and this stuff rules there! Fantastic on pork! Or try brushing some on chicken as it finishes off the grill!  Use fresh ground peppers for the best flavor. This will keep in fridge for a couple of weeks.\"",
    "ins": "In a heavy non-reactive saucepan, stir together the mustard, brown sugar, vinegar, and beer. Season with chili powder and black, white, and cayenne peppers. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook for about 20 minutes. DO NOT BOIL, or you will scorch the sugar and peppers.\nMix in the Worcestershire sauce, butter, and liquid smoke. Simmer for another 15 to 20 minutes. Taste, and season with hot sauce to your liking. Pour into an airtight jar, and refrigerate for overnight to allow flavors to blend. The vinegar taste may be a little strong until the sauce completely cools.",
