    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.\nMix cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Fill muffin cups with batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 19 to 23 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.\nBeat shortening and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; add vanilla extract and mix well. Beat confectioners' sugar, alternating with milk, into butter-shortening mixture until frosting is stiff and holds its shape; mix in green food coloring until desired color is reached.\nFill a piping bag, or large resealable freezer bag with a corner snipped, with frosting. Pipe frosting around the top half perimeter and top of each cupcake creating the \"head\" and \"face\"; smooth out the frosting using a small spatula, flattening the top into a square-shape for the top of his \"head.\"\nPour chocolate sprinkles into a shallow bowl and dip the top of each cupcake into the sprinkles, slightly angling the cupcake to get sprinkles around the uppermost top side of the \"head\" for the \"hair.\"\nPress 2 dark brown chocolate pieces on the sides of each cupcake creating the \"bolts.\" Press 2 blue chocolate pieces into the top front of each cupcake creating the \"eyes.\" Put a dot of black food gel in the center of each blue candy for the \"pupil.\" Make a \"stitch\" onto the \"face\" using the red food gel.",
