    "ins": "Place sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until sausage is cooked and onions are translucent.\nMix in the rice, celery, sprouts, mushrooms, water chestnuts, poultry seasoning and sage. Cook until all ingredients are warmed through.\nPlace dressing in a cheese cloth large enough to hold enough stuffing to fit inside turkey cavity.  Any remaining dressing may be put in cheese cloth and set along side turkey while baking so as to absorb turkey drippings.",
