Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.\nPlace tomato halves, onion, and garlic in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Stirring occasionally, roast 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until evenly browned. Remove from heat, and allow to cool completely.\nPuree the roasted vegetables in a blender or food processor. Drain any remaining liquid from rice.\nHeat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in serrano chili, and cook until tender. Place rice, pureed vegetables, peas, carrots, potato, and sour cream in the skillet. Season with cilantro and salt. Cook and stir until all vegetables are tender and rice is browned.
