    "des": "\"Super easy and extremely good. I found a recipe online that was similar, but it had too many ingredients. I simplified it and now it can be made mostly in the slow cooker.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken breasts into slow cooker; pour in chicken broth. Season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook on Low until chicken is tender, about 4 hours.\nDrain broth; shred chicken with 2 forks in the slow cooker. Add Buffalo sauce, cream cheese, and ranch dressing mix; stir until well mixed. Cook on low until flavors are blended, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nSpoon chicken onto the tortillas and sprinkle cheese on top. Roll up and place seam-side down on a nonstick baking sheet. Brush all sides of taquitos with oil.\nBake in the preheated oven, turning every 5 minutes, until slightly browned, about 15 minutes.",
