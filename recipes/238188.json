    "des": "\"This is a delicious summer salad. Great as a dinner salad with some grilled chicken or fish, or as a side. This is my first experience with kale, and I'm hooked! Add nuts (walnuts, cashews, slivered almonds), sunflower seeds, or dried fruit (cranberries or cherries) for some added texture and deliciousness! I also like to add thinly sliced red bell peppers or Shepherd peppers; it is a salad, anything goes! The citrus vinaigrette is light and refreshing. Sometimes I want a sweeter vinaigrette, hence the addition of marmalade. Apricot would work well, too. A great summertime salad.\"",
    "ins": "Place kale in a large bowl and gently massage it with your hands until slightly tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Let kale rest to tenderize further, about 10 minutes.\nStir avocado, mango, chickpeas, and cucumber into kale.\nCombine olive oil, vinegar, orange juice, sunflower seed kernels, mustard, poppy seeds, and marmalade in a jar with a tight-fitting lid; put on the lid and shake until dressing is well combined. Pour dressing over kale mixture and toss to coat.",
