    "des": "\"A creamy, slightly sweet margarita approved by all my friends. I learned how to make margaritas from my husband's Mexican family, so I tend to prefer them stronger than some people, though I've never had complaints. I included the brand names of my favorite ingredients, but I'm sure others will work as well.  Try to avoid sweet and sour mixes that contain synthetic ingredients - these taste awful. Some people like to rim the glass with toasted coconut flakes. Serve over ice and enjoy!\"",
