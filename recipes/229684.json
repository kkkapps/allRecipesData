    "des": "\"Savory pork roast recipe for the barbecue. Use this Chinese spiced pork alone, in stir-fries, or in soup. Serve sliced with veggie fried rice, Asian coleslaw, and grilled pineapple. This pork is tasty sliced and stir-fried with snow peas and onion. It's supreme in pho and excellent sliced into wonton or udon noodle soup. Best summer adaptation: in buckwheat or soba noodles for a cold salad.\"",
    "ins": "Combine honey, hoisin sauce, dark soy sauce, star anise, five-spice powder, and aji mirin in a glass measuring cup. Set microwave oven for 60 percent power and heat in microwave oven for 22 seconds. Stir mixture and pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add pork loin to the bag, knead to coat meat with marinade, and refrigerate at least 4 hours or up to two days.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove pork roast from bag and wrap meat tightly in aluminum foil. Discard used marinade.\nCook on the preheated grill until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast reads 155 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 50 minutes. Let meat stand for 10 minutes before slicing.",
