    "des": "\"A simple and sweet treat that packs a lot of flavor. It makes a great alternate breakfast side in place of the standard hash browned potatoes. Try it as a breakfast side with scrambled eggs! Sweet potatoes let off a lot of water as they cook, so it may be necessary to drain the hash before serving.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir sweet potatoes into butter to coat. Add brown sugar and stir until integrated.\nIncrease heat to medium-high; cook and stir until brown sugar caramelizes on surface of the sweet potato cubes, 5 to 7 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Stir zucchini into the sweet potato mixture; cook and stir until zucchini is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess liquid to serve.",
