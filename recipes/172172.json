    "ins": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder; set aside. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish.\nThread the green beans onto toothpicks, making bundles of about 5 green beans each. Dip the green bean bundles into the buttermilk, then into the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour. Fry in the hot oil until the flour turns golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, and serve hot.",
