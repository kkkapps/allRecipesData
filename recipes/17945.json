I like to add white wine, soy sauce, and various herbs and spices. Anything that you like will work, so experiment at will.\"",

Then pour this mixture over the meat, poultry, or fish that you are preparing. Soak for several hours, or overnight. (Note: Make certain the meat is fully submerged in the brine, and make more brine as needed to fully cover the meat.)",
