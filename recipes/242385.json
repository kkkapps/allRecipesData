    "ins": "About 1 hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine all rub ingredients in small bowl; mix well. Generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\nHeat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 275 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.\nPlace the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.\nRemove ribs from grill.  Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 2 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.\nRemove ribs from grill and unwrap. Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with barbecue sauce.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce.\nServe ribs with remaining barbecue sauce.",
