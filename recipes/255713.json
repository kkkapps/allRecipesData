Slowly add flour and whisk constantly until mixture is light brown, about 1 minute. Slowly pour in the milk while constantly whisking until a smooth sauce forms, 2 to 3 minutes.\nStir cream cheese into sauce until melted; add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and whisk until blended. Pour sauce of \"noodles\" and top with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.",
