    "des": "\"I took the original recipe found on this site and changed it up to be gluten-free and lower in sugar/fats. These muffins were highly praised, thinking these were too good to be gluten-free! I prefer to cut the fats and sugars in half by using applesauce and agave nectar.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.\nBeat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl; add egg and beat until creamy.\nWhisk flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and allspice together in another bowl. Stir 1/2 the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir applesauce into butter mixture; mix well. Stir remaining 1/2 the flour mixture into butter mixture until just combined; add oats and chocolate chips. Pour muffin batter into prepared muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.",
