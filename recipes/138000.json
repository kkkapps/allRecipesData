    "des": "\"My father believes in a condition called 'the gin meanies.' He invented this cocktail to satisfy his taste for gin, while allowing him to slightly dilute its effects with vodka. His passion for this concoction quickly spread to my friends, who have been known to throw parties solely to celebrate him and his martini.\"",
    "ins": "Measure the vodka and gin into a cocktail shaker and add a generous scoop of ice cubes. Secure the lid and shake until the outside of the shaker becomes frosty cold. Strain into two martini glasses. Garnish each drink with two olives speared on cocktail picks and a twist of lemon.",
