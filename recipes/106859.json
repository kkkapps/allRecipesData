    "des": "\"A classic tapioca pudding recipe that requires a lot of attention, but it's worth it. Tapioca pudding is a great comfort food and can be served warm or cold.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the milk, tapioca, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan.  Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to low; cook and stir 5 minutes longer.\nWhisk 1 cup of the hot milk mixture into the beaten eggs, 2 tablespoons at a time until incorporated.  Stir the egg mixture back into the tapioca until well mixed.  Bring the pudding to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat; cook and stir 2 minutes longer until the pudding becomes thick enough to evenly coat the back of a metal spoon.  Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.  The pudding may be served hot or poured into serving dishes and refrigerated several hours until cold.",
