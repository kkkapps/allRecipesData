    "des": "\"This is a basic popover recipe tweaked to make mini cinnamon popovers. They are dipped in melted butter and covered in cinnamon sugar! They are addicting, and great any time of the day. Serve them warm, but just make sure you don't peak and open the oven door!\"",

Stir together the flour, cinnamon, and baking soda in a separate large bowl.  Pour the egg mixture into the the flour mixture and whisk until smooth; being careful not to overbeat. Fill muffin cups 1/2 full.\nBake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.  Do not open the oven door.\nPlace cinnamon sugar in a brown bag for shaking and set aside. Remove popovers from oven and let cool in pan for 5 minutes. Roll popovers in melted butter then place in brown paper bag; shake until the popovers are evenly coated. Serve immediately.",
