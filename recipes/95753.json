    "des": "\"My good friend brought this to me in the hospital after I had just had a baby. My husband promptly took it home and ate the entire thing without sharing. I had to remake it myself to find out what he'd been raving about. I've made a few adjustments and so can you according to your tastes! This is a great casserole to make because some of the canned ingredients you may already have. Serve with sour cream, hot sauce, and cold diced tomatoes or salsa if you like. Maybe even serve some chips and guacamole to round it out.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and season with cumin, Mexican seasoning and cayenne pepper. Stir in the onion and garlic and cook until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Add red, yellow and orange peppers; cook and stir for another 5 minutes, then mix in the black beans, kidney beans and corn. Remove from the heat.\nLine the bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch baking dish with corn tortillas. Pour in the skillet mixture then top with cilantro and pepperjack cheese.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is starting to brown on top. Let stand for 10 minutes, then serve with your favorite Mexican food toppings.",
