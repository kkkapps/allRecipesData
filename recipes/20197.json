Don't drink this if you have to drive tonight! Each household has its own variety; this is the one my Dutch neighbors used to make when I was a kid in Amsterdam for Christmas and New Year's Eve.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan on medium-low heat, combine wine, sugar, and cinnamon. Cut the orange in half, push the cloves into the outside of the orange halves, and place them into the wine.\nHeat slowly on low heat for about 30 minutes or until steaming; do not let it boil. Heat your glasses in warm water before serving.",
