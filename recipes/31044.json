    "des": "\"This is a Pakistani dish. When ever my mother makes this dish there is none left. She does not like to be heavy handed with spices, which makes her cooking light, yet aromatic. We usually eat this dish with warm pita, raita (yogurt laced with a dash each of salt, black pepper, cumin powder and chopped green chilies), and finely sliced onion laced with lemon juice.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, and saute until light golden, then throw in the garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Put in 1/4 cup of the water and tomato, then season with salt, red chili powder, cumin, and turmeric. Simmer for 1 minute.\nAdd beef and cook for at least 10 minutes, adding another 1/4 cup of the water when it gets dry. When the beef mixture is dry, pour in the black-eyed peas. Cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of water, and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer until all of the water has cooked down, and you can see the oil.\nRemove from the heat and mix in the garam masala. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle the lemon juice, cilantro, and green chilies over the top.",
