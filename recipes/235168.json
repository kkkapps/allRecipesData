    "des": "\"From Canada with love - a superb way of serving salmon fillets with a bit of a sweet kick. This can't-miss recipe is from my great friend Sharon O. in Calgary. She always serves us the best salmon dinners and I told her I would submit this on her behalf.\"",
    "ins": "Place soy sauce, maple syrup, rye whiskey, and wasabi paste into a blender. Cover blender and puree until smooth. Pour half of the mixture into a resealable plastic bag for marinade and reserve remaining mixture in the refrigerator for dipping sauce. Place salmon in the bag, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate salmon in the refrigerator for 4 hours.\nSubmerge cedar planks in water and soak for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Remove salmon fillets from marinade, and place each one on a soaked cedar plank. Discard bag and marinade.\nPlace planked salmon into the grill, close cover, and roast until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Serve with reserved dipping sauce.",
