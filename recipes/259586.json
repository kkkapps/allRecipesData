    "des": "\"My family and I went to the Cheesecake Factory\u00c2\u00ae in Nashville and we got the best cheesecake I had ever had. I came home and was determined to figure the recipe out. I tried it out one weekend and it tasted almost identical of the original. Garnish with more fresh banana slices.\"",

Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Refrigerate crust until ready to use.\nBeat cream cheese in a large bowl with electric mixer at medium speed until creamy. Add 2/3 cup sugar and cornstarch; beat until blended. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in bananas, 1/2 cup cream, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract until well combined. Pour cream cheese mixture into the crust. Lay the pan on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
