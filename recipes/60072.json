    "des": "\"A fresh spring salad of mixed greens tossed with chopped tomatoes over a bed of avocado.  A fresh lemon vinaigrette and darling daisy garnish finish off this salad with flair. Be sure to use the white daisies with yellow centers, and make sure they are pesticide free.\"",
    "ins": "In the container of a food processor or blender, combine the lemon juice, Dijon mustard, shallots, vinegar, and parsley. Process until shallots are no longer visible. Slowly pour in the oil while continuing to blend. Blend in sour cream, and season with salt and pepper.\nCut the avocado into quarters and remove the pit. Cut each quarter into 3 slices. Fan each quarter of the avocado towards the side of each salad plate. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce mix with tomatoes. Pour dressing over the lettuce and tomato, and toss to coat. Portion the salad onto the plates so that the ends of the avocado fan are showing. Sprinkle each plate with pine nuts, and garnish with a daisy bud.",
