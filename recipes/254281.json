    "ins": "Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).\nPlace eggs in mixing bowl. Add milk, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, flour, lemon zest, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Whisk together until completely combined.\nHeat 2 teaspoons olive oil in cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add bacon and cook until fat is rendered out and bacon begins to crisp up. Add asparagus and raise heat to high. Cook and stir about 1 minute.\nPour batter into pan in a circular motion.\nBake in preheated oven until browned and puffed, 12 to 13 minutes.",
