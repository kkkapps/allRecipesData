    "des": "\"I love the tangy taste of fried green tomatoes, but they are, well...fried! And messy to make. I developed this recipe to help assuage my hunger for fried green tomatoes, and yes, it does the job quite well. Without all the grease and batter, the tangy taste of the tomato can really shine through!\"",

Whisk soy sauce, olive oil, brown sugar, vinegar, black pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; pour over vegetable mixture. Toss to coat.\nBake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes; stir about 20 minutes into cooking to redistribute sauce.",
