    "des": "\"These oranges involve no cooking, few ingredients and next to no work. Served by my great-grandmother at every Christmas gathering, these are one of the few traditions I take from my father's family. Using macadamia nut oil in place of the olive oil is also a good flavor combination.\"",
    "ins": "Trim the stem ends and bottoms off of the oranges, and slice each one into thin rings. Cut a small notch in the peel of each slice so that the slices can be peeled and eaten more easily.\nArrange the orange slices in a single layer on serving platters. Drizzle olive oil over each slice and use your fingers to rub it into the oranges. Garnish with a light dusting of paprika and season each slice with a little salt and pepper.",
