Cook 2/3 cup oats, 1/3 cup brown sugar, cinnamon and allspice until golden brown. Stir in 2/3 cup water and remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar. Cook until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool.\nIn a large bowl, combine flour, 1/3 cup uncooked oats, baking powder and wheat germ. Whisk together egg and evaporated milk. Make a well in the center of flour mixture, and pour in egg mixture and cooked oatmeal. Mix just until combined. Dredge raisins in 1 tablespoon flour, then fold into batter. Spoon into muffin cups.\nBake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes.",
