    "des": "\"Potatoes and chicken are seasoned generously with adobo seasoning and garlic. A good garlic chicken recipe for those of you who love garlic.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSlice the potatoes into thick strips like steak fries, and layer them in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and dust with 1 tablespoons of the adobo seasoning.  Arrange the chicken pieces on top of the potatoes. Drizzle the remaining olive oil onto the chicken, and sprinkle the rest of the adobo seasoning. Sprinkle the sliced garlic around the chicken.\nBake, uncovered for 1 hour, or until the chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear. If using a meat thermometer, the internal temperature should be 175 degrees F (79 degrees C). If the chicken becomes too dark before it has finished cooking, cover the dish with aluminum foil.",
