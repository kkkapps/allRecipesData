    "des": "\"I've always marveled at how deviled egg recipes can be fiddled with and ingredients switched in and out, but they always still taste so good! I made this version last night for my fiance, and he loved the blend of sweetness and spiciness! These have oregano, Parmesan-Romano cheese, Dijon mustard, and a dash of hot sauce. I garnished them with a shredded Cheddar cheese blend and some paprika.\"",
    "ins": "Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.\nCut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Parmesan cheese, oregano, and pepper sauce; season with salt and pepper.\nArrange egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into a resealable plastic bag; snip off one corner of the bag, and pipe filling into egg white halves. Sprinkle deviled eggs with Cheddar cheese and paprika.",
