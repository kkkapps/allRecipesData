    "des": "\"This syrup is based on an ancient Persian recipe, and it keeps virtually indefinitely without any special care.  Excellent for camping, and truly refreshing on a hot, hot day!  And there's no waste, you use every part of every ingredient in this stuff.  After straining, remove the lemon peels and ginger and toss in a bag of sugar for a candied treat!\"",
    "ins": "Bring the sugar and water to a boil over high heat.  Boil until the sugar has dissolved, then stir in the strawberries, mint, ginger, lemon peels, and lemon juice.  Return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove from heat, and stir in the white balsamic vinegar.\nAllow the syrup to stand overnight at room temperature, then strain out the fruits with a fine sieve.  Store at room temperature in a sterile container.\nTo use, stir 1 part syrup into 4 to 6 parts water; serve cold with ice if desired.",
