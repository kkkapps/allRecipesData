    "ins": "In a heavy pot, heat oil over medium heat. Saute onions in oil until tender.\nAdd paprika, textured vegetable protein, and green pepper; cook and stir mixture until vegetables are coated with paprika.  Stir in broth or water, potatoes, carrots, tomato, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and parsley.  Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until carrots and potatoes are almost tender.  Add more water if needed.\nIn a small bowl, mix together, egg, flour, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Mix in enough water to have a smooth consistency; dough should be stiff and sticky.  Spoon onto a flat plate, and slice off small amounts into soup while it is simmering.  Add to soup in such a way that noodles do not land in the same spot every time. Continue until all mixture has been added to pot.  Simmer until done.",
