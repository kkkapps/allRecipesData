    "des": "\"This is a nice soup recipe with a lot of texture and flavor. It is a welcome change for those weeks when there doesn't seem to be a lot of variety... and all 3 of my kids even loved it. This can also be cooked in a pan on the stove until the barley and carrot are tender, but I prefer the slow cooker method. The flavors seem to blend better.\"",
    "ins": "In a skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage, onion, and garlic until the sausage is evenly brown. Season with Italian seasoning. Remove from heat, and drain.\nIn a slow cooker, mix the sausage mixture, chicken broth, carrot, spinach, and barley.\nCover, and cook 4 hours on High or 6 to 8 hours on Low.",
