    "des": "\"A quick, light couscous stir-fry with Indian flavors. Great for vegetarians, but easily adapted into a chicken dish. Feel free to substitute veggies any way you like. Other options include sliced zucchini, string beans, eggplant, carrots, snow peas, and celery. Also try adding sesame seeds, flax seeds, or sesame seeds towards the end of stir-frying. Can be served with plain yogurt.\"",
