    "des": "\"This isn't your ordinary fried bologna sandwich. Fry up authentic Italian mortadella with onions and peppers, layer it in a hoagie roll, and top with cheese, fried potatoes, and fried eggs.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir potatoes until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Set aside on a paper towel-lined plate.\nPlace onion and pimiento peppers in the hot skillet; cook and stir until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add mortadella and cook until warmed through and slightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.\nSpread each bun with 1 tablespoon spicy mustard. Layer with 2 slices Swiss cheese. Top with 1/4 of the mortadella and onion mixture and sprinkle with 1/4 of the fried potatoes. Top with 2 slices Asiago cheese. Repeat to make 4 sandwiches.\nPlace sandwiches onto a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and buns are toasted, about 5 minutes.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat; cook eggs, 2 to 4 at a time if necessary, until whites are set but yolks are still soft, about 2 minutes per side. Place two eggs in each sandwich.",
