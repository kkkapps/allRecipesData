Chop the leaves until fine but still a little leafy.\nCombine the chopped kale, pomegranate seeds, sunflower seeds, and sliced almonds in a large bowl; toss to combine. Drizzle the rice vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil over the kale mixture while continuing to toss. Season with salt to serve.",
