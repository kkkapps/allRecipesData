    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine apples, lemon juice, sugars, spices, flour, butter, and caramels.  Stir to coat fruit evenly.\nRoll dough out, and cut out two crusts.  Line a pie plate with one of the crusts.  Spoon filling into the bottom crust, and cover with the top crust.  Crimp the edges. Place the pie on a baking sheet covered with foil.  Poke fork holes over top.  Sprinkle lightly with granulated sugar.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 50 minutes.  If you notice overbrowning after 30 minutes, reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Serve warm, or at room temperature.",
