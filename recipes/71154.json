Use any beer of your choice, we used Budweiser. Roll this beef up in a lettuce leaf with some rice for a fun dining experience. No silverware needed! -Kids love it!\"",

Place meat in the marinade, cover, and refrigerate overnight for best results.\nCombine rice and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, until rice is tender.\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry beef strips for about 5 minutes on each side, or to your desired doneness.\nServe beef with rice and lettuce leaves. Spoon some rice and beef into a lettuce leaf, fold in the sides and roll up to the top to make a bag of bulgogi. No silverware needed.",
