This recipe creates a fresh and sweet treat with minimal sugar allowing you to indulge in fruit and chocolate, the best of both worlds! Store the remaining ice cream in a container in your freezer for later enjoyment!\"",

Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze until slightly thickened, 25 to 30 minutes (time varies according to ice cream maker specifications). Stir chocolate and strawberries into ice cream mixture; allow to mix until thickened, 3 to 5 more minutes.",
