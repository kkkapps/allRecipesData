    "ins": "Stir warm water and honey together in a bowl until honey dissolves. Sprinkle yeast over water mixture and let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.\nStir oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix 3 cups of flour into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is no longer sticky and pulls together. Continue kneading for 5 minutes in a stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand.\nPlace dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nPunch down dough and let rise again until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.\nGrease three 9x5-inch loaf pans.\nPunch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Form dough into 3 loaves and place into prepared pans. Cover loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until dough is about 1 inch above the sides of the loaf pans, about 45 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake in preheated oven until tops are golden brown and the bottoms of loaves sound hollow when tapped, about 40 minutes. Remove loaves from pans and transfer to a cooling rack.",
