All ingredients should be at room temperature. The recipe can also be halved but this freezes beautifully so don't hesitate to make the whole batch.\"",
    "ins": "Mix confectioners' sugar, powdered milk, processed cheese food, butter, cocoa powder, walnuts, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with a stand mixer using the dough hook attachment until mixture is blended. The mixture will seem dry at first; continue mixing until smooth.\nPress cheese mixture into a large baking sheet. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.",
