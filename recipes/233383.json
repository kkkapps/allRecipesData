    "des": "\"This unusual pairing caught my eye one day in an old cookbook of my mother's which I was reading. I love those three ingredients but I wasn't too sure I'd like them together. Well, I'll leave that to you but my finicky husband asked me what made those chops taste soooo good!\"",
    "ins": "Whisk anchovies, rosemary, olive oil, vinegar, and garlic together in a large bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag.\nSeason pork chops with coarse salt and ground black pepper; add to the plastic bag with the marinade, squeeze out as much air from bag as possible, and seal. Turn bag a few times to assure chops are coated in marinade.\nMarinate chops in refrigerator at least 2 hours.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Prepare a jelly roll pan with cooking spray.\nRemove pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess moisture. Discard the remaining marinade.\nCook under the broiler until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
