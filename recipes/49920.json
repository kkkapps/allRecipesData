    "des": "\"This is a one-pot dish that my mother-in-law has made for years. It's very simple and extremely tasty. You could substitute chicken for the pork, or use orzo pasta instead of rice. It can also be made ahead and frozen for the days when you don't want to cook.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with a little salt and pepper, then brown them in the hot oil on both sides. Remove the chops to a plate, and add the syrup, tomato sauce, and tarragon. Reduce heat to medium-low, and when the sauce mixture is warm, return the pork chops to the sauce, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the chops are cooked through.\nRemove the chops from the sauce, and set aside, keeping warm. Add the rice to the sauce, cover, and cook until rice is tender, about 10 minutes. Serve rice and sauce with pork chops over the top.",
