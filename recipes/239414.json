Place steaks in an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to cook.\nRemove the steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steak with black pepper.\nHeat cast iron pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil and heat until oil shimmers.\nCarefully place steaks in pan. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes.\nTurn steaks and top with one teaspoon butter. Cook for 3 to 4 more minutes or to desired doneness. You may need to cook the steaks in batches depending on the size of your cast iron pan. Keep the cooked steaks in a 170 degree F oven until ready to serve.",
