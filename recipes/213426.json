    "des": "\"Handed down through the generations in my family. Even people who swear they hate liver and onions love this dish. Goes great with corn casserole and garlic mashed potatoes, or freshly sliced tomatoes and corn-on-the-cob. \"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and mushrooms; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Push onion mixture to the side of the skillet, and place the butter in the center of the skillet. Add calf's liver, one slice at a time. Cover and cook until lightly browned, flipping liver slices once, 5 to 6 minutes. Cut liver slices in half.\nWhisk together flour, water, and beef bouillon in a bowl until combined. Pour mixture into the skillet; cook and stir until gravy thickens, then add red wine. Cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and serve.",
