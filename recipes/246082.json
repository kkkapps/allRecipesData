Whisk in eggnog, cream, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined.\nPour eggnog mixture into 4 ramekins. Place ramekins in baking dish; pour in enough boiling water to come half way up the sides of ramekins.\nBake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour. Cool slightly, cover ramekins with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 4 hours.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nRemove plastic wrap from ramekins. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar in a thin layer over top of each ramekin. Brown the sugar using a kitchen torch or under a broiler until golden and caramelized, 30 seconds to 1 minute.",
