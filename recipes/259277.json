    "des": "\"This is a simple yummy recipe I made for my husband and 2-year-old. Neither one cares for tomatoes, but they could easily be added to the recipe. This recipe is mild for the kids but can be kicked up with more spice. It's also good for families on a budget! Garnish each serving with fresh or dried cilantro.\"",

Simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Serve bean mixture over rice; top with shredded Colby cheese.",
