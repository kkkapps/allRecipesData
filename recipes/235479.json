    "des": "\"Roasted vegetables are one of my absolute favorite side dishes, especially in the winter. They take a while to cook, but overall are an extremely easy dish to prepare. I've found that the key is to place them low in the oven so that you get a good caramelized side. Don't move or flip them, but keep an eye on them so that you don't go past 'caramelized' to 'burned.'\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set an oven rack to the second-lowest level in the oven.\nFill a bowl with lightly salted water. Place Brussels sprouts in salted water and let sit for about 15 minutes; drain.\nStir potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, beets, shallot, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour vegetables in a single layer onto a baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven until caramelized and cooked through, about 45 minutes.",
