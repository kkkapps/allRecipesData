    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).  Set rack in the middle of the oven.  Butter and flour a 9 1/2 inch springform pan, and tap out excess flour.\nPlace the ricotta in a large mixing bowl, and stir it as smooth as possible with a rubber spatula.  Stir the sugar and flour together thoroughly into the ricotta.  Stir in the eggs 1 at a time.  Blend in the vanilla, cinnamon, orange zest, and salt.  Pour batter into the prepared pan.\nBake in the center of the oven for about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, until a light golden color.  Make sure the center is fairly firm, and the point of a sharp knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool on a wire rack.  It will sink slightly as it cools.  Cover, and chill till serving time.",
