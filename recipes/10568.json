    "des": "\"Great fresh lemon taste in a chewy little cookie with a nice crisp brown edge.  If you don't have the almonds, you can substitute 1/4 cup additional sugar instead.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBeat butter and sugar in a large bowl with electric mixer on high speed until fluffy.  Beat in remaining ingredients except flour until well blended.\nOn low speed, beat in flour just until blended.\nDrop by rounded teaspoonfuls 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Sprinkle with sugar or almonds.\nBake 10 to 12 minutes until edges are lightly browned.  Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute before removing to wire rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.  HINT:  These cookies will have a nicely browned edge if baked on a regular thin cookie sheet rather than a thick or insulated one.",
