    "des": "\"A basic sweet dough that can be used for bread, cinnamon rolls, crescent rolls, etc. I've had it ever since my home economics class in high school.  It's a very simple and easy recipe that anyone can make.\"",
    "ins": "In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt; stir well. Cut in margarine with a fork until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add warm water to flour mixture. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed for 2 minutes. Add eggs and 1 more cup of flour; beat until thick. Stir in the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough comes together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Cover dough with a damp towel and let rest for 20 minutes.\nPunch down dough and form into desired shape. Cover and refrigerate dough for up to 48 hours. Let dough come to room temperature before baking in a 375 degree oven.",
