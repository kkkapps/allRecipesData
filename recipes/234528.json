    "des": "\"A quick, spicy sausage cheese dip. This isn't tea party food, nothing dainty or low-fat about it. This is an appetizer that eats like a MEAL and it keeps guests coming back to the bowl. You may have to work out twice to make up for it, but you'll be happy you did! Best served hot with plenty of tortilla chips.\"",
    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain in a colander and discard grease. Transfer sausage to a large saucepan.\nStir 1 package taco seasoning into sausage and cook over medium heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups water and remaining package taco seasoning. Stir until seasoning is dissolved; simmer for 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low.\nGradually add cheese food, stirring until cheese is evenly melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix hot sauce into melted cheese mixture. If the mixture becomes too thick, add remaining 1 cup water, as needed.",
