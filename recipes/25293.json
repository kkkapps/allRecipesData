    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Lightly grease a baking dish.\nIn a saucepan bring 1 cup water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Peel onions and slice off the tops; boil for 12 to 15 minutes, or until tender but not mushy.  Drain, cool and remove the centers, leaving the shell intact.  Chop onion centers and reserve 1/2 cup.\nPlace sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain and set aside, reserving drippings.  Saute green pepper and 1/2 cup chopped onion in sausage drippings.\nIn a large bowl combine green pepper, onion, sausage, egg, 1 cup cooked rice, cream cheese, oregano and parsley.  Spoon mixture into onion shells and place in prepared dish. Combine melted butter and paprika; brush tops of onions.\nCover and bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
