    "des": "\"I love dumplings. This meat-free version is very tasty. You can add a drop or two of half and half to the food processor with the edamame, if you have some, or one tablespoon of olive oil to make the mix a bit creamier. Substitute different fillings if you like. I've used ground pork instead of shrimp and edamame, and I recently made an all-veggie version with edamame, spinach, bok choy and mushrooms. Soooooo goooooood. If you use pork or other meat, you may need to increase the steam time (after you add the water to the pan) and additional minute or two. Shrimp cooks faster than meat!\"",
    "ins": "Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the insert. Bring the water to a boil. Add the edamame, place a cover on the saucepan, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6.\nPlace steamed edamame in a food processor; blend until smooth. Transfer edamame puree to a large bowl.\nStir the shrimp, bok choy, egg white, ginger, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, garlic, and salt into the edamame puree.\nPour about 2 tablespoons water in a dish.\nScoop about 1 teaspoon of the shrimp mixture onto the center of a dumpling wrapper.\nWet the edge of the wrapper with water, then fold over to create a half-moon shape; pinch edge to seal.\nPlace the finished dumpling on a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with a damp towel; repeat with remaining wrappers.\nWorking in batches of 6 to 8 dumplings, heat about 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry dumplings until crispy on one side, about 2 minutes.\nFlip dumplings and cook for 1 more minute. Add 1/4 cup water to the skillet and cover.\nSteam dumplings until shrimp are bright pink and no longer transparent in the center, about 4 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dumplings.\nFor the dipping sauce: Whisk low-sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, green onion, sugar, rice vinegar, and red pepper flakes together in a shallow bowl until sugar has dissolved.",
