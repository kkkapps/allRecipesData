    "des": "\"Smoky mezcal and an unusual liqueur are the stars of this flavorful cocktail. You'll shake the mezcal with amaro, lime juice, and simple syrup, and then top it off with a splash of ginger beer and a floater of Malort\u00c2\u00ae liqueur. There's so much going on in this cocktail. It's like nothing you've tasted before. Garnish with fresh mint and a wedge of lime. This exciting cocktail is the signature drink at Simone's in Chicago.\"",
    "ins": "Combine mezcal, lime juice, simple syrup, and amaro liqueur in a cocktail shaker; fill with ice, cover, and shake until chilled. Fill a lowball glass with ice. Strain cocktail into lowball glass, top with ginger beer, and float schnapps over the top. Garnish with mint and lime.",
