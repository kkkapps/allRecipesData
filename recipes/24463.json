    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine margarine, water and cocoa. Bring to a boil, and remove from heat. Combine the flour and 2 cups sugar; stir into the cocoa mixture until well blended, then stir in the eggs, sour cream, baking soda and salt. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.\nIn a small bowl, beat the cream cheese and 1/3 cup sugar until smooth. Spoon the cream cheese mixture over  the batter in the pan. Swirl with a knife for a marbled effect. Sprinkle with chocolate chips.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until brownies start to pull away from the sides. Cool and cut into bars.",
