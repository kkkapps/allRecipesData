    "des": "\"It took me a while to get it right, but this just hits the spot when you want something soothing.  It's hearty as a soup, can be thickened to make a stew, or strained to make a side dish.  It's creamy, smoky, ever-so-slightly bitter, and goes with chicken, pork, fish, and beef.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the bacon to the onions; continue cooking and stirring until the bacon fat begins to render, about 5 minutes more. Mix the garlic into the bacon and onion mixture, reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking until the garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes.\nStir the undrained navy beans into the mixture; bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low. Fold the spinach into the mixture until the leaves are evenly coated. Place a cover on the saucepan; simmer to allow the flavors to blend, about 1 hour. Squeeze the half lemon over the dish and stir to serve.",
