    "des": "\"This delicious soup has only 6 ingredients.  It was given to me by my boyfriend's mom who adapted it from another recipe.  It can be as thick or thin as you like, and I like it quite thick.  To dress it up when serving, drizzle some cream on top and float a lime twist or slice of lime on top.  Delicious hot or cold.\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes and ginger in large saucepan. Pour in chicken stock and water, and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes have softened, about 30 minutes.\nPuree potatoes and lime juice in a food processor, or with a hand blender until smooth.  Return soup to saucepan and stir in milk or cream as desired; heat until warmed through.",
