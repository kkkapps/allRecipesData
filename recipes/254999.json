    "des": "\"Healthy, delicious, thick sauce made with simple fresh ingredients reminiscent of a bruschetta topping cover a grilled mild white fish. I like to serve it with brown rice that has been mixed with butter and Parmesan cheese. If you are watching fat and calories, omit the butter and cheese.\"",

Add tomatoes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir over medium heat until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in spinach, basil, and capers. Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated and sauce is thick and chunky, 10 to 20 minutes.\nPreheat grill for medium heat.\nRub remaining 1 tablespoon oil over amberjack fillets. Sprinkle salt and pepper on top. Grill fillets until opaque and flaky, 3 to 4 minutes per side.\nServe fillets topped with sauce.",
