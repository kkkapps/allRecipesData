    "des": "\"Whenever I hear people say you shouldn't ruin fresh fish at the sushi bar by dipping it in copious amounts of wasabi-spiked soy sauce, I think to myself, yeah, but that's how I like it. Sometimes I just don't care about overpowering the natural flavors, and this grilled yellowfin tuna with freshly grated horseradish sauce recipe is one of those times.\"",
