    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nCombine sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Roll pie dough onto a work surface and cut each circle into 16 wedges. Lightly spread butter onto each piece of dough stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge. Place 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon miniature chocolate chips on the buttered portion of the dough pieces.\nLightly moisten the point of each wedge with water and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Roll each wedge from the outside toward the point, creating a croissant-shape; pinch edges closed.\nBeat egg white in a bowl, adding enough food coloring to reach desired color. Dip the top of each croissant-shaped dough in egg white mixture and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each with cinnamon-sugar and top with sprinkles. Place 2 miniature chocolate chips on 1 end of each for the \"eyes\".\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.",
