    "des": "\"I got this recipe from my mother-in-law.  It's a wonderful, light, refreshing slush that we all love.  She always added a cherry, for color.  You can make it using lemon-lime flavored soda instead of ginger ale, if you like.  Adjust the amount of soda depending on how strong you'd like the drink to be.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot, bring 7 cups water to boil. Mix in the sugar, stir and cool.\nIn a small pot, bring 2 cups water to boil. Remove from heat, add tea bags, and let them steep 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool.\nRemove tea bags from the tea, and pour the tea into the water and sugar mixture. Mix in orange juice, lemonade, and vodka. Stir well to combine the ingredients. Transfer the mixture to a freezer-safe bowl and place mixture in the freezer. Stir occasionally until you are ready to serve.\nTo serve:  In a chilled glass, pour 2/3 cup of slush and 1/3 cup of ginger ale.",
