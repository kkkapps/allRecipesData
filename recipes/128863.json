    "des": "\"This is a cornbread stuffing with jalapenos, cranberries, bacon, and pecans. I cooked up this recipe while living in Texas. I serve it with turkey but I have also stuffed it in apples and cooked them in a crock pot to serve with pork loin for Christmas dinner. This recipe makes the house smell fantastic!\"",
