    "des": "\"This recipe was originated by one of my mom's friends, who made it totally from scratch one night at a homeless shelter, when they ran out of ingredients.  They used whatever they had.  It was served, and the people loved it!  This recipe has been passed around ever since!  It's a delicious cake that people go ga-ga over!  It's best when made the day before. Frost with whipped topping and serve with fresh fruit.\"",
