    "des": "\"This is my ultimate comfort food, thanks to years of enjoying it as a child. While the flavors aren't sophisticated, they're satisfying. This basic dish is virtually fail-proof and is a great way to use up leftover pasta as a side or can be a quick meal in a pinch. In my family, it was served with ketchup, but feel free to jazz it up with your favorite vegetables for a nutritious variation.\"",

Drain.\nMelt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon cooked pasta over the butter, without stirring. Season pasta with paprika, salt, and pepper.\nPour eggs over pasta and cook, without stirring, until eggs begin to set, about 2 minutes. Cook and stir eggs and pasta until eggs are nearly set, about 5 minutes. Cover skillet and remove from heat; allow to sit until eggs are set, 2 to 5 minutes.",
