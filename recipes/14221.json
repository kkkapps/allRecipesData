    "des": "\"This lemony salad is served hot from the wok. Escarole is a bitter green, but can be less so when grown shielded from the sun.  In general, lighter green leaves indicate a milder flavor. Thinly sliced tomatoes are a great accompaniment. This recipe can be doubled.  For a larger party, cook in batches.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a wok over high heat. Add escarole; cook and stir until greens begin to wilt.  Stir in lemon juice.  Add capers, salt, and olives; cook and stir for another 15 seconds. Season with black pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.",
