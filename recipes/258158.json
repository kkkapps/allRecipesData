    "des": "\"These Chinese cakes are filled with purple sweet potato, making them both gorgeous looking and tasting. Naturally sweet, glutinous rice flour is available in Asian markets and also many supermarkets. It makes a delicious pastry.\"",
    "ins": "Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add sweet potatoes, cover, and steam until tender, about 20 minutes.\nMash sweet potatoes in a bowl using a potato masher. Let cool, about 10 minutes.\nMix water into the rice flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until a pliable dough forms. Divide dough into walnut-sized balls.\nRoll out balls of dough into thin rounds on a flat work surface. Drop spoonfuls of mashed sweet potato onto half of the rounds. Cover with remaining rounds. Press edges together to form little cakes.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook cakes in batches until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.",
