    "des": "\"This is just like spicy chicken wings, only less work.  Cooks up nicely in the slow cooker! A quick meal that is super easy and oh so yummy! For crispier chicken, bake in a 400 degrees F oven for the final 30 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "Place the drumsticks in a slow cooker, and sprinkle evenly with pieces of butter. Pour the hot sauce over the chicken, then season with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Cover, and cook on High for 3 hours, or until tender.  Serve chicken legs with blue cheese dressing on the side.",
