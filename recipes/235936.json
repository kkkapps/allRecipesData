    "des": "\"Freekeh is fire-roasted baby wheat. It can be found in international or Middle Eastern stores. It can be used to replace rice. It has a very distinctive flavor. Any veggies or spices can be added to this recipe. This freekeh recipe will have a thick tomato saucy consistency. It has a slight kick, too.\"",
