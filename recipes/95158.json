    "des": "\"This is a great BBQ Turkey recipe. We almost never have any leftovers.  This recipe can be used with almost any size bird.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat a gas grill for low heat.\nRub some of the butter all over the turkey, inside and out, then rub all over with chicken base. Cut remaining butter into cubes and toss with onions, apples, and garlic in a large bowl. Stuff the bird with this mixture and place in a disposable aluminum roasting pan. Fold the turkey skin around the neck area to cover the hole and then turn the turkey over and pour wine into the opening at the other end until the turkey is full or the bottle is empty. Set the turkey breast side up.\nPlace the roasting pan on the grill and cover loosely with aluminum foil.  If you have a pop up timer or heat safe meat thermometer, insert it into the turkey breast. Close the lid.\nRoast until the temperature in the breast reads 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) and the temperature in the thickest part of the thigh reads 180 degrees C (80 degrees C), about 4 hours depending on the temperature of your grill. When the temperature is getting close, remove the aluminum foil covering the turkey and allow it to brown during the final minutes of cooking. If it starts to brown too much, just cover it back up. Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20 minutes before carving.",
