    "des": "\"These are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course! This is a very simple recipe that I came up with a few years ago. It's not rocket science, just ribs cooked in the slow cooker and finished in the oven. This is what I do when I want ribs during the week and have to work all day. I'm eating them within a half-hour of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!\"",
    "ins": "Season ribs with salt and pepper.\nPour water into slow cooker. Layer the ribs into the slow cooker. Top the ribs with onion and garlic.\nCook on High for 4 hours (or Low for 8 hours).\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nTransfer ribs to a baking sheet. Discard onion and garlic. Coat ribs with barbeque sauce.\nBake in preheated oven until the sauce caramelizes and sticks to the meat, 10 to 15 minutes.",
