    "des": "\"This is a great easy prawn marinade, they are great on the BBQ, we put them out as appetizers but they can also be a main course. I've also sauteed them with the marinade and used the sauce with pasta or just lapped it up with French bread! ENJOY.\"",
    "ins": "In a glass dish, mix together the olive oil,  mustard, garlic, lemon juice, orange juice, basil and white wine. Add the prawns, and stir to coat. Cover, and let marinate for 1 hour.\nHeat an outdoor grill to high heat.\nThread prawns onto skewers. Grill for 3 to 5 minutes, turning once, until pink.\nIf desired, reserve marinade; transfer to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Serve with prawns.",
