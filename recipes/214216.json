    "des": "\"I love pork chops. I love fruit with pork chops. The most common fruit accompaniment for pork is apple, but I wanted to try something a little different. I considered apricots (I love them too), but thought they are too sweet. After reading a number of different recipes, I settled on blackberries. They are tart and, I thought, would pair well with a sweet port to make the sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Season the pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and pan fry the chops until they are lightly browned and no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Set the chops aside.\nHeat 1 more teaspoon of olive oil in the skillet, and cook and stir the shallots and thyme until the shallots start to become translucent, about 1 minute. Pour in the port wine, blackberry juice, chicken broth, and balsamic vinegar. Bring the mixture to a boil, scraping off and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the skillet into the sauce. Cook until reduced by a third, about 5 minutes. Mix cornstarch and water into a paste, and stir into the sauce. Cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the blackberries. Simmer until berries are hot.\nReturn the chops to the skillet, and turn to coat with sauce. Serve hot, topped with sauce.",
