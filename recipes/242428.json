    "des": "\"This delicious dessert hits the spot for anyone, young or old. The marshmallow melts in your mouth with a smooth taste of Nutella\u00c2\u00ae. The slightly crunchy buttery taste of the bread ties everything together making this an irresistible delight. It's okay, we all need to indulge once in a while.\"",
    "ins": "Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread evenly over 2 slices of bread. Arrange marshmallows over chocolate-hazelnut spread. Place remaining 2 slices bread over marshmallows creating 2 sandwiches. Spread butter over both sides of each sandwich.\nPlace both sandwiches in a skillet over medium heat and grill until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.",
