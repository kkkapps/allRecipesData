    "des": "\"Creamy chicken, veggies and pasta star in this one-dish meal that you can make ahead up to 24 hours in advance. Or freeze it uncooked until you need it. In place of the canned green beans, you can substitute 16 ounces of mixed veggies, frozen or thawed. If frozen, you'll need to extend the cooking time by about 15 minutes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCook the rigatoni according to package directions until al dente. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, boil the chicken breasts until fully cooked.\nIn a large bowl, combine the soup, mayonnaise, lemon juice, curry powder, green beans and mushrooms. Drain and stir in the rigatoni. Cube the cooked chicken breasts and stir this in as well. Transfer this mixture to a large casserole dish.\nSprinkle the cheese on top over all. In a medium bowl, combine the butter and the corn flakes and spread this mixture over the cheese. Finally, top off by sprinkling with the parsley.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly.",
