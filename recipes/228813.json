Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until nearly tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cut in quarters.\nThread 4 shrimp onto skewers, piercing each shrimp near the head and tail, alternating with potato, onion, and tomato chunks; repeat with remaining skewers. Arrange skewers on a platter and coat with olive oil. Season with salt and black pepper.\nCook skewers on preheated grill until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 10 minutes.",
