    "des": "\"This authentic Mexican recipe I picked up while living in Mexico.  It has a spicy, smoky flavor from chipotle peppers.  It is perfect for a buffet where people can serve themselves and even better heated up as leftovers the next day! If this is too spicy for you, try using less chipotle peppers.\"",
    "ins": "Place the chicken into a large pot along with 1/4 cup of sliced onion, garlic, and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 25 minutes. Remove chicken, cool, and shred meat. Discard skin and bones.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining onion slices, and fry until transparent. Place tomatoes into a pan of boiling water (you could use the leftover chicken water), and boil until they split open.\nPlace the tomatoes, the whole can of chipotle peppers, chicken bouillon into a blender or large food processor. Process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Pour this mixture into a large pan, and add the shredded chicken and cooked onions. Heat through.\nTo serve, each person spreads some sour cream on their tostada shell, and tops with a spoonful of the chicken.",
