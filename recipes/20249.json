    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.) Lay one crust into a 9 inch pie pan, making sure the edges extend slightly beyond the pan.\nIn a large bowl, mix together white and brown sugars, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and almond extract. Add the strawberries to the mixture and gently stir to coat thoroughly. Pour into the crust, mounding it slightly in the middle.\nCut the second crust into 1/2 inch strips and weave into a lattice over the filling. Roll up the extra dough on the bottom crust to seal down the lattice strips, then press with fingers to form a fluted edge. Dot with butter in the open squares. For a golden crust, brush lattice lightly with milk, then sprinkle with sugar.\nBake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown.",
