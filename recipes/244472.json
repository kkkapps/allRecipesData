    "des": "\"A massively underrated summer dessert, semifreddo has a rich taste, and you get what's basically an airy, custard-style ice cream without having to use a machine. However, it all comes at a cost. The classic procedure is a little bothersome, since you need to make three separate components \u00c2\u2013 a zabaione, a meringue, and whipped cream \u00c2\u2013 so, I decided to simply use the eggs whole, and make a 'zabaringue.' I knew I wouldn't get as much volume, but I didn't care.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk eggs, sugar, coffee-flavored liqueur, instant coffee, and 1 teaspoon cocoa powder together in a metal bowl.\nPlace bowl over low heat on the stove (holding bowl with a dishtowel) and continue whisking until mixture thickens, 4 to 6 minutes. Whisk continually to prevent eggs from scrambling. Remove bowl from heat and let mixture cool completely. (You can set the bowl on ice water to speed this up.)\nWhisk ice-cold heavy cream and sugar together in a chilled bowl until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cooled egg-coffee mixture to the whipped cream. Stir with a spatula until just combined.\nTransfer mixture to serving cups. Wrap cups in plastic wrap and freeze until firm, 8 hours or overnight. Garnish with whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa powder.",
