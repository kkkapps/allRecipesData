    "des": "\"This is a chicken recipe that can be done in the oven or on a grill. It has a very salty/vinegary taste and a crispy outside. To do on a grill, follow same recipe but you may use a folded foil 'pan' instead of a baking dish.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix the cider vinegar, vegetable oil, egg, salt, and poultry seasoning. Place the chicken thighs in the bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nArrange the chicken thighs in a baking dish, and cover with about 1/4 of the marinade mixture.\nBake chicken 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Drain off the marinade so that the chicken skin will become crisp (a baster works well for extracting the marinade). Continue baking 15 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.",
