    "des": "\"Pinto beans slow cooked in beef bouillon, topped with ground beef and Mexican-style cheeses create the centerpiece for these layered corn tortilla treats. Very high in protein and fiber. I prepare the beans before I leave for work, so they will be tender by dinner time. Pick your favorite garnishes and toppings, like salsa, tomatoes and sour cream.\"",
    "ins": "In slow cooker, combine boiled pinto beans with bouillon cubes and enough water to almost fill cooker. Let simmer on Low setting for 8 hours.\nIn a large skillet, brown beef with salt, pepper and onion. Drain well and set aside.\nAssemble as follows: Top each tortilla with beef mixture, cheese and a ladel of beans with juice from slow cooker. Top with preferred garnishes as desired and serve.",
