    "des": "\"On a recent trip to Bali, my Balinese stepmother, Putu, let me help her prepare chicken - and I furiously committed her 'non-recipe' to memory to bring home.  She has a big mortar and pestle for this kind of thing; I don't, so I end up using both sides of my meat mallet; you just want to get the ingredients well combined and at least somewhat reduced in mass. And since they're baked, not deep-fried, they're a (relatively) healthy pile of wings!  I particularly like them with roasted sweet potatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Combine garlic, chile pepper, shallot, turmeric, and kosher salt; bruise with a mortar and pestle, or with the flat side of a cleaver. Place into a bowl, and stir in brown sugar, and olive oil. Toss chicken wings with marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Toss the chicken wings again to recoat in marinade, then spread out onto prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until deep, golden brown, about 30 minutes.",
