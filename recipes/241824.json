    "des": "\"Attention, cheese lovers! This may be the best cheese spread you've ever had! My friend's mother gave me this recipe over 15 years ago. I always make it around the holidays, or for football and hockey game nights. Everyone begs for this recipe. Turn this into a pub spread by adding a half cup of your favorite dark ale. Use brick cream cheese for a spread, or spreadable cream cheese for a dip. Serve with crispy crackers, toast, or bagels.\"",

Microwave cheese in 30-second intervals on high just until softened, stirring between intervals.\nStir red onion, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, paprika, and hot sauce into cheese mixture with a fork until evenly combined; spoon into an airtight container and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.\nRemove cheese spread from refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.",
