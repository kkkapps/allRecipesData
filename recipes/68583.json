    "ins": "Place ground veal in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Set aside.\nMelt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir in flour until smooth, and cook for about 2 minutes. Gradually stir in milk, then chicken broth to make a smooth thick sauce. Add the cooked ground veal, and season with paprika, chili powder, curry powder, salt, pepper , Worcestershire sauce, and parsley. Stir to blend well. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool to room temperature.\nWhen the meat mixture is cooled and slightly firm, shape into cylinders 3 to 4 inches long, and 1 1 /2 inches wide. If you wish, press a strip of the spiced Gouda cheese into the center, making sure it is completely surrounded.  In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Place bread crumbs on a plate or tray. Coat croquettes with flour, then dip in the beaten egg mixture, then roll the croquettes in the crumbs to coat. Repeat the coating process if a thicker breading is desired.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, fry croquettes until golden brown on all sides. If you have a deep-fryer, they can be deep-fried instead. Remove to paper towels to drain, and serve hot.",
