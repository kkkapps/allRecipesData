    "des": "\"This is a favorite supper dish that's quick and easy to make.  I double it for our family of 4 growing boys.  We serve it all up and then add on the goodies that are left in the bottom of the bowl - there's always bacon and eggs left down there.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.\nMeanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, reserving some of the drippings, crumble and set aside.\nScramble eggs in bacon drippings.\nPlace spaghetti in a  large bowl.  Pour in olive oil, and mix well; use enough to just moisten spaghetti.  Stir in bacon, eggs, and Parmesan cheese.  Serve immediately.",
