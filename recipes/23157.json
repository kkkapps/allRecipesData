    "des": "\"This is a very easy way to make a Thanksgiving turkey using an oven bag. The bird will be perfectly moist when done, and you can make gravy out of the juice that forms in the bottom of the bag. Plus, cleanup is a snap! The cooking time will vary for different sized turkeys.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRinse turkey and remove giblets. Salt and pepper to taste.\nSprinkle the bottom of a turkey size oven bag with flour. Place turkey, celery and onions in the bag. Seal bag and poke several holes in it with a fork.\nBake 3 to 3 1/2 hours, or until internal temperature of the thigh meat reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C).",
