    "des": "\"One lazy weekend afternoon right after Christmas, in the midst of taking down the tree and lots of cleaning, I threw this fast and easy soup together to feed our little family fast with minimal dishes and effort involved. Garnish with cheese or chopped onions. We got out a few chips to dip in it also. It was a hit!\"",

Pour in milk slowly, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes.\nStir white beans into the saucepan. Add green chile peppers, onion powder, cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.",
