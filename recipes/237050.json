    "ins": "Blend contents of 1 can cannellini beans with its liquid in a blender until pureed.\nHeat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, carrots, Spanish onion, and leek in hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; add garlic and continue cooking until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes more.\nStir farro into the vegetable mixture; add water, pureed cannellini beans, the drained cannellini beans, diced tomatoes, vegetable broth, zucchini, tomato paste, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Stir the mixture well and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the pot, and simmer until the farro is tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\nStir kale, salt, and pepper into the stew. Add more water to the stew if needed to keep everything covered in liquid and continue cooking until the kale is bright green and fully tender, about 30 minutes more.",
