    "des": "\"Lobster is steamed in white wine then served in lobster scented cream sauce. This is a specialty of Jean-Baptiste Molinari of Dromoland Castle.\"",
    "ins": "In a large skillet, combine the carrot, celery, onion and white wine. Bring to a boil. Add lobsters, cover, and cook until lobsters turn bright red, about 8 minutes. Remove lobsters from the sauce and allow to cool.\nWhen the lobsters have cooled enough to handle, cut each one in half lengthwise. Remove the lobster meat from the shell and claws, keeping it and the shell intact. Discard the tomalley if desired. Slice each tail piece into 4 medallions and set aside.\nContinue to simmer the wine and vegetables in the skillet until the liquid has been reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Return the shells to the sauce and stir in the brandy. Simmer for 5 minutes. Strain the stock through a sieve or mesh strainer into a saucepan. Stir in the heavy cream and cook over medium heat until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the butter just until melted. Add the lobster meat to the sauce and cook over low heat until heated through.",
