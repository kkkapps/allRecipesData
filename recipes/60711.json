    "des": "\"It seems all families have some weird salad they just can't do without during the holidays, and this is ours. I like to call it 'Christmas Eve Salad, Traditionally Served on Thanksgiving.' My Mother always referred to it as 'light' and 'refreshing.' Well, refreshing maybe. Goes great with holiday ham, and looks pretty in a clear glass bowl.\"",
    "ins": "In a large mixing bowl, cream together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, and 3 tablespoons of reserved pineapple juice. Gently fold in whipped cream and marshmallows.\nTransfer the mixture to a serving bowl, smoothing top with a rubber spatula or large spoon. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight. Serve chilled.",
