Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the orange zest.  Pour the mixture evenly over the crunch layer in the pans.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack and cool completely before frosting. Frost (crunch side up) between layers, on top and sides. Arrange orange sections on top, then refrigerate.\nTo make the frosting:  In a medium bowl, beat the vanilla frosting until light and fluffy, then mix in the whipped topping.  Stir in the orange and lemon zest.  Use frosting on completely cooled cake layers.",
