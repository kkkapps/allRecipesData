    "ins": "Score the surface of the ham, making diamond shapes about 1/2-inch deep. Place the ham in a large, resealable bag. Add the bourbon, brown sugar, crushed pineapple, honey, and garlic to the bag; refrigerate at least 8 hours, turning the bag over several times while marinating.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nTransfer the ham and marinade to a large baking dish; pour the water into the dish. Attach the pineapple rings around the surface of the ham with toothpicks.\nBake in preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (95 degrees C), basting occasionally with the sauce in the pan, 90 to 105 minutes.",
