    "des": "\"This is my grandmother's recipe for chili and the only one I make for my family now since we all love it so much. This recipe is great after it has sat overnight in the fridge as well. The flavors blend nicely over time. Garnish with shredded cheese or other ingredients to you're liking.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until soft. Stir black beans, diced tomatoes, chicken, chili seasoning, cumin, salt, and pepper through the onion, breaking up large pieces of chicken until shredded; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and cook at a simmer until hot, about 15 minutes.",
