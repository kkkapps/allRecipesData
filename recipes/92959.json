    "des": "\"These are nice cupcake treats for dogs that I made up for my dog Presley's 4th birthday.  They are perfect for dogs with food allergies. Warning: they don't look pretty, but Fido will love them!  These freeze well, and you can zap them in the microwave for a nice, occasional dog snack.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper liners.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the apple, cheese, applesauce, eggs and olive oil. Combine the whole wheat flour, oats, baking powder and minced garlic; stir by hand into the wet ingredients until well blended. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.\nBake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly pressed. Cool completely before serving.",
