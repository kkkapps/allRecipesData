    "ins": "Melt butter in a deep skillet over medium heat. Stir in celery and onions; cook and stir until tender but crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.\nMix orange juice, chicken broth, rice, orange zest, and poultry seasoning into the vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce heat; cover. Simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes.",
