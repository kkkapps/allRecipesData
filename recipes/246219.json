    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breasts with Creole seasoning, salt, and pepper; cook until evenly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool.\nCut each puff pastry sheet in half. Place 1 sliced chicken breast on each half; top with 1/4 of the bacon and 1 Brie cheese slice. Fold top and bottom of pastry over chicken. Press pastry seams together with your fingers to seal; place seam-side down on prepared baking sheet.\nCook in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
