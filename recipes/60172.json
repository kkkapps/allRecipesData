    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees F).\nArrange chicken breasts in a baking dish so they are not crowded. In a cup or small bowl, mix together the pepper jelly, mustard and honey; pour over chicken to coat.\nBake uncovered for about 1 hour, basting occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear.",
