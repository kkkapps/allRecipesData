    "des": "\"A true German/Polish dish that is simply 'Delish'! I sometimes use Swiss cheese in place of the Cheddar, which is a good switch as well! This is a casserole that is very inexpensive, simple and quick to make - and not to mention leftovers are the best the next day as well!!\"",

Cook kluski noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.\nMelt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Whisk in flour, dry mustard, and black pepper; cook until smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk in milk, a little at a time, and bring white sauce to a boil.

Whisk 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese into sauce until melted.\nStir kluski noodles, sauerkraut, and kielbasa sausage into the sauce and transfer to a 3-quart casserole dish. Mix bread crumbs with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese in a bowl and sprinkle over the casserole.\nBake in the preheated oven until casserole is heated through, about 20 minutes.",
