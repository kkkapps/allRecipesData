    "des": "\"What timing!  Although I have eaten mussels many times, October 17 was the very first time I cooked them, and (if I do say so myself!) they were great.  A friend and I ate every last one, and he raved about the flavor the whole time.  This is my own recipe.\"",
    "ins": "In a stock pot, combine the wine, juice cocktail, garlic and pepper flakes. Bring to a boil and add mussels.\nCover and continue to boil for about 4 to 6 minutes or until all the mussels have opened. Discard any mussels that haven't opened.\nRemove mussels from liquid and keep warm. Pour off liquid to leave about 1 cup. Try not to discard the garlic. Boil the 1 cup of liquid until it's reduced to about 3/4 of a cup.\nAdd butter and stir until butter has melted and sauce has thickened slightly. Serve mussels with sauce.",
