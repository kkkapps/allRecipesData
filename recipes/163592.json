    "ins": "Stir the sausage and onions together in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 8 minutes. Drain the grease off of the sausage in a mesh strainer, then return to the skillet. Stir in the cream cheese and diced tomatoes until the cheese has melted and the mixture begins to bubble. Stir in chives before serving.",
