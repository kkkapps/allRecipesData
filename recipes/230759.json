Place a baking rack on top of a large baking sheet.\nThread each slice of bacon onto a skewer; place skewered bacon on the baking rack.\nBake bacon in the preheated oven until crisp; 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely.\nCombine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave in 30 second intervals until chocolate is melted and smooth, stirring after each interval.\nCoat each side of the skewered bacon with the chocolate mixture using a pastry brush. Place coated bacon on a sheet of waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Store in refrigerator until ready to serve.",
