    "ins": "Whisk orange juice, cumin, chile pepper, and sea salt together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade.\nCook the steak until it starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).",
