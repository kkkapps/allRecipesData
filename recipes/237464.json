    "des": "\"This is not a thick soup, yet it is creamy and so smooth to the palette. The aroma when cooking makes you want some before the potatoes are soft. I have made modifications due to allergy to corn (such as rice flour). I allow mine to slow-simmer with lid slightly ajar. Stir often so the film does not form on top. I have doubled my batch and still never have any for the freezer.\"",
    "ins": "Spray a stockpot with cooking spray.\nMelt butter in the prepared stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir celery, onion, paprika, seafood seasoning, thyme, salt, and white pepper until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk flour into vegetable mixture until smooth and dissolved. Pour seafood stock over vegetable mixture.\nMix half-and-half, cream, and milk into broth mixture; decrease heat and simmer until bisque is thickened, about 15 minutes. Add crabmeat and simmer bisque until crabmeat is heated through, about 5 minutes more.",
