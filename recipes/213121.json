    "des": "\"A way to bake brie without the bread or dough around it, with almonds and a delicious tangy sauce.  Gluten-free option. Serve with tart apple slices and either fresh crusty bread or good quality gluten-free crackers.\n\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpread the butter over the top of the brie and top with the almonds. Place the brie in a baking pan and bake until the top puffs up, about 25 minutes. You may need to place a square of foil over the top after 15 minutes to prevent the almonds from burning.\nCombine the balsamic vinegar and molasses. Drizzle the mixture on a serving plate and carefully place the baked brie on top of the balsamic mixture.",
