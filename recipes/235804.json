    "des": "\"This is a very simple and delicious recipe. The combination of caramel, pecans, pumpkin, and a graham cracker crust brings the flavors together. Taste-wise I prefer to make a homemade crust, but a pre-made graham cracker crust can be substituted to reduce prep time. It is a staple in our family around the holidays and has won several cooking contests. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do! Store leftovers in the refrigerator.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCombine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a mixing bowl until evenly moistened; press into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the crust is lightly browned and smells toasted, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.\nSpread 1/4 cup caramel topping onto the cooled crust. Sprinkle 1/2 cup pecan pieces over the caramel topping.\nWhisk milk, pumpkin, pudding mix, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl until well combined. Stir 1 1/2 cups whipped topping into pumpkin mixture. Spread pumpkin mixture into crust. Spread remaining whipped topping over the top of the pie. Refrigerate pie until chilled, at least 1 hour. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons pecans atop the pie and drizzle with 2 tablespoons caramel using a fork.",
