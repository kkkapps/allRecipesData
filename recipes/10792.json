Mix well, and set dough aside.\nTo Make Filling:  In a saucepan, combine dates, sugar, water and nuts.  Cook over medium heat until thick. Cool filling.  If necessary, add water until mixture can be spread easily on the dough.\nDivide dough into 4 parts.  Roll out each piece on a floured surface to 1/2 inch thick.  Spread with cooled, not cold filling.  Roll up jelly-roll style.  Close ends and place rolls on cookie sheets.  Refrigerate until cold.\nSlice chilled rolls, and bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes.",
