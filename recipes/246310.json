    "ins": "Using a 2 inch circular punch, cut 4 circles out of white corn tortillas.\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the tortilla circles in peanut oil until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels.  Add thinly sliced garlic to the oil and cook until golden and crispy. Drain.\nIn a bowl mix yuzu juice, fish sauce and sesame oil together. This is the ponzu sauce.\nThinly slice the hamachi into 1 1/2-inch square slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Marinate the hamachi in the ponzu juice for about a minute.\nPlace hamachi slice onto mini-tostada, then layer with cilantro leaf, crispy garlic, shaved serrano, onion and bacon.\nRepeat these steps for the 3 remaining pieces.",
