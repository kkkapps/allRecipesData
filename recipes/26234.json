    "des": "\"My great-grandmother Schneider always baked these German cookies for the Christmas holidays. These cookies have a distinctive flavor that comes from anise oil. A springerle rolling pin is best, but one can use cookie presses. They are best if made about two weeks in advance and then stored in an airtight container before eating.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, whip egg whites until stiff. Beat in the yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the confectioners' sugar, baking powder and anise oil. Mix in the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each, until dough is fairly stiff. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/2 inch thickness. Flour a springerle rolling pin and carefully roll it over the dough, leaving the imprints. Cut cookies along the lines of the design and place them 1 inch apart on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Let cookies stand overnight in a cool place to dry.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake cookies for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the bottoms are  lightly browned.",
