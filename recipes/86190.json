    "des": "\"Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce are the base of the marinade for this smoky pork tenderloin. The pork is grilled to perfection, and sliced into thin strips. Serve on a bed of baby greens or shredded Napa cabbage.\"",
    "ins": "Puree first seven ingredients plus 2 Tbs. oil in a blender until smooth, about 30 seconds. Pour all but 3/4 cup of mixture into a gallon-sized zipper bag. Add meat; seal and refrigerate 30 minutes to 4 hours. Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil into remaining mixture for a dressing.\nBrush plums with oil; season with salt and pepper. Toast almonds in a 350-degree oven for 4 minutes. Finely shred cabbage. Set all aside.\nBuild a fire on one side of grill, so you have direct and indirect heat. When coals are covered with white ash, place plums, cut side down, and meat over direct heat; cover and grill until meat is well seared, 5 minutes. Then turn pork to sear other side, 5 minutes more, rearranging plums to ensure even browning. Move meat and plums to indirect heat; cover and grill 12 to 13 minutes, or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest end of meat registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).\nRemove meat and plums to a platter; let sit 5 minutes or up to 1 hour. Cut pork, crosswise, into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Toss cabbage with almonds, salt, pepper and most of dressing. Arrange slaw in each of six shallow bowls. Place a portion of pork over each and 2 plum halves alongside. Drizzle with remaining dressing; garnish with cilantro.",
