    "des": "\"Soft and chewy, the best chocolate chip cookie EVER! For best results, refrigerate dough overnight.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together the flour and baking soda in a bowl.\nIn a large bowl, mash the butter and margarine together until thoroughly blended, and mix in the white sugar, brown sugar, and instant pudding mix. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Mix in the flour in several additions, then mix in the chocolate chips. Dough will be stiff.\nDrop by tablespoon onto an ungreased, nonstick baking sheet, about 2 inches apart; flatten the cookies slightly.\nBake in the preheated oven until light brown and still soft on top, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not overbake. Allow to cool for 1 minute on the baking sheets before removing and cooling completely on racks.",
