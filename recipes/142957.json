    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes; drain.\nLightly grease a skillet with cooking spray.  Cook the prosciutto in the skillet over medium heat until just brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, drain excess fat and set prosciutto aside on paper towels.\nMeanwhile, heat the cream in a saucepan over medium-low heat.  Slowly stir in 1 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in small amounts.  When all the cheese has been melted, stir in the peas and prosciutto.  Allow to heat for 2 minutes more.  Pour over drained pasta and toss lightly.  Season with salt to taste and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.",
