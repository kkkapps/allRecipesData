    "des": "\"Normally Chai has tea in it, but this beverage doesn't miss it at all. When I lived in Holland, this drink was a staple in the diet of a bunch of hippies who lived in and around a squatted building known as 'De Elf.'  Sadly, the building was closed a year after I left the country, but if you combine the taste of this drink with the smell of musky smoke and Nag Champa incense, you're halfway to recreating the atmosphere.  Enjoy...\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan over high heat, bring the soymilk to a boil, then reduce heat to medium. Stir in the ginger, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Sweeten to taste with brown sugar. Strain the mixture into another pot; serve hot.",
