    "des": "\"From the maker of 'Greasy Chicken' comes my signature dish, the most requested and favored chicken, ever! The mushrooms and onions taste great after cooking in the lemon juice, and it is especially good when marinated ahead of time.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSpread the chopped onion and mushrooms evenly in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange chicken pieces over the vegetables, skin side up. Squeeze lemon juice over the chicken pieces, and season with garlic salt and pepper.\nBake chicken uncovered for 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Carefully turn the pieces over, and continue cooking 15 minutes more.\nSet oven to broil. Cook chicken for 5 minutes, or until chicken skin is crisp.",
