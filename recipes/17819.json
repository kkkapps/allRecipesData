    "des": "\"This is a wonderfully easy soup made from leftover veggies. It fills the house with such a great aroma. We call it Potpourri Soup. You can try it with ground turkey instead of ground beef. If you do, replace one cup of the water with a small can of beef broth.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot over medium heat, combine the ground beef and onions and saute for 10 minutes, or until the beef is browned and the onions are tender.\nAdd the water, tomatoes, barley, carrots, celery, beans, salt, ground black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce and hot pepper sauce to taste.\nBring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, or until all vegetables and barley are tender.",
