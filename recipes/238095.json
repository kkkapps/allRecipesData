    "des": "\"This is the best salsa ever! The recipe was given to me by a friend and it always goes quickly. It's easy to double, and people always ask for the recipe so have extras on hand! I prefer fresh tomatoes, but the recipe calls for canned. You can also substitute any fruit to adjust it to your tastes. If you have a food processor or mini chopper, this recipe is much quicker and easier. Serve with Tostitos\u00c2\u00ae Scoops!\u00c2\u00ae chips. Enjoy!\"",
