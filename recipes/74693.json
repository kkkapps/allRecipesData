    "des": "\"This is an excellent way to serve mussels on the half shell. They are topped with a tangy blend of bell peppers and vinaigrette dressing. This makes a good for appetizer for a larger number of guests.\"",
    "ins": "Bring one inch of water to a boil in a large pot. Add mussels, cover, and steam for 3 to 5 minutes, until they are all open. Drain. Remove one side of each shell, and arrange the open shelled mussels on a serving platter. Discard any mussels that do not open.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the red, yellow, and green bell peppers, olive oil, wine vinegar, parsley, egg, salt, and pepper. Spoon over the mussels on the shells. Refrigerate until serving.",
