    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nWhisk honey, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic together in a small bowl.\nArrange chicken wings on prepared baking sheet.\nBake chicken in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Brush 1/2 of the honey mixture over the wings; bake for 10 minutes. Brush remaining sauce over wings, sprinkle sesame seeds over the top, and bake wings until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish wings with scallions.",
