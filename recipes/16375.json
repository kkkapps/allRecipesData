    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nSqueeze any excess moisture from the potatoes and combine them with the melted butter or margarine in a small bowl. Press this mixture into the bottom and sides of an ungreased 10 inch pie pan.\nBake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 25 minutes.\nRemove pan from oven and arrange the ham and cheese evenly over the potatoes. In a separate small bowl, beat together the eggs and the cream. Pour this over the ham and cheese.\nReturn pan to oven and bake for 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until the custard has completely set.",
