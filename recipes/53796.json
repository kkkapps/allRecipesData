    "des": "\"Here's a special-occasion roast enhanced with classic seasonings. Roasting two large ends of tenderloin instead of one whole piece ensures even cooking. (The meat needs to be coated with its aromatic rub, then chilled for at least six hours before roasting.)\"",
    "ins": "In a food processor, combine rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, garlic, shallot, orange zest, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. Run machine while adding oil; process until smooth. Spread mixture evenly over all sides of tenderloins. Place beef in a large glass baking dish. Cover with foil, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tenderloins on a rack in a large roasting pan.\nRoast beef in preheated oven until meat thermometer registers 140 degrees when inserted into center of beef, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven, and cover loosely with foil; let stand for 10 minutes. Slice beef, and serve.",
