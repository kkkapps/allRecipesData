    "des": "\"This is a tried-and-tested recipe! I remember seeing an ad on TV about cooking with mayonnaise and decided to give it a shot. I've made it with just the mayonnaise on top and it really locks the moisture into the chicken. The bread crumbs and cheese are a must for me; they complement each other very well.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a baking pan.\nMix Parmesan cheese and mayonnaise in a bowl; spread evenly over chicken breasts. Coat with bread crumbs; sprinkle with herbes de Provence.\nBake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
