    "des": "\"I love this recipe because it's very easy and very much an under-20-minute recipe when you are in a hurry! I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and a side of either mixed veggies or some sweet corn on the cob! I top it with my Mustard Pork Garnish recipe I have on site.\"",
    "ins": "Stir panko bread crumbs, parsley flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper together in a bowl. Dip tenderloin slices in the crumb mixture to coat both sides.\nHeat olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet and fry the pork until the crumb coating is browned and the pork is no longer pink inside, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the pork should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).",
