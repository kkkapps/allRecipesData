Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.\nWhisk confectioners' sugar and warm water together in a small bowl until you have a smooth icing. Dip top of each cookie in the icing, Top with additional crushed candy cane, if desired. Set aside to let the icing dry, at least 5 minutes.",
