    "des": "\"Chicken breasts are sauteed to a golden brown then topped with a rich, savory Gorgonzola sauce. Serve with steamed green beans and fresh crusty bread if you are looking for a winner to impress your dinner guests. This dish is so decadent it tastes exactly as though you ordered it at a fine Italian restaurant, but the secret is how simple it actually is to make! This sauce is also a wonderful accompaniment to pork chops, ravioli, or whatever strikes your fancy!  It is very versatile, so the possibilities are endless!\"",
    "ins": "Combine basil leaves, 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, walnuts, Parmesan cheese, and garlic in a food processor; process until pesto is smooth.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to serving platter.\nCook and stir mushrooms in a single layer in the same skillet until tender, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add half of the Gorgonzola cheese; cook until slightly melted. Pour in wine and stir to scrape up brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir lemon juice, chicken broth, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper into the sauce.\nBring chicken broth mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until sauce is reduced by 1/4, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in pesto and return chicken to the skillet. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 5 minutes more. Add remaining Gorgonzola cheese and chopped tomatoes.\nServe each chicken breast on a plate topped with sauce.",
