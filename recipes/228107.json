    "des": "\"Did not see this recipe anywhere on Allrecipes and, as it's been a huge favorite here for years, I decided to post it. Dazzling with a nice steak! Serve year round. Turkey bacon and fat-free mayo may be substituted, though keep in mind that both will sacrifice a bit of taste. :)\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Chop potatoes and transfer into a large salad bowl.\nPlace the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon when cool.\nStir mayonnaise, crumbled bacon, cucumber, red onion, 3 chopped eggs, celery, 1/2 cup parsley, and 1 tablespoon paprika into the potatoes until thoroughly combined. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Garnish salad with slices of hard-cooked egg, 3 sprigs of fresh parsley, and a pinch of paprika.",
