    "des": "\"A really easy Swedish ham recipe made with a port wine and cream sauce.  I serve it for birthdays.\"",
    "ins": "Place the ham slices in a shallow baking dish, and pour port wine over them. Marinate overnight in the refrigerator.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nPour off the port wine from the ham into a medium bowl. Roll up each slice of ham lengthwise, and place side by side in the baking dish. Mix the cream, curry powder, and tomato puree into the port wine. Pour over the ham, making sure to get all of the slices covered. Dot the top with small pieces of butter.\nBake uncovered for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the ham begins to brown on top.",
