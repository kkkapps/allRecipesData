    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.\nLine the cavity of the fish with slices of garlic, and slices of lemon. Stuff the fresh basil and rosemary inside. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap the fish in foil, and set on wire rack over a campfire, or on the grill.\nCook for 15 to 20 minutes over direct heat, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Remove herbs and lemon from the fish. Hold the fish up by its spine, and comb the meat from the bones using a fork. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over fish.",
