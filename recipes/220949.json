    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGrease a 2-quart baking dish.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.\nStir melted butter and noodles in a large bowl.\nMix apples, egg yolks, sugar, raisins, cinnamon, and vanilla extract into noodle mixture until well blended.\nBeat egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.\nFold egg whites into noodle mixture; pour into prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until browned, about 40 minutes.",
