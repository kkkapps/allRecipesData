    "des": "\"A light and high-protein vegetarian egg dish, easy and fast, which can be enjoyed hot or cold with a green salad for lunch or some whole grain bread for breakfast. I love to eat this after a hard workout or bike ride. Serves 2 but easily scalable. Cut in half and serve with toast, a small salad, or some fresh fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir broccoli, bell pepper, and sweet onion in hot oil until hot, about 3 minutes. Place a cover on the skillet and continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes more. Stir olives into the vegetable mixture.\nBeat eggs, egg whites, milk, salt, and pepper together with a whisk in a small bowl; pour over the vegetable mixture in the skillet. Sprinkle feta cheese over the egg mixture.\nReplace cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the egg is lightly browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip the frittata and cook until the bottom is again lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more.",
