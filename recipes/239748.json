    "des": "\"Cream cheese and chocolate are a perfect combo for melt-in-your-mouth truffles. Adding a little shortening to the\n\nchocolate as it melts makes the chocolate more fluid and easier to use for coating. It also makes the chocolate a \n\nlittle shinier once it has set. Transfer truffles to individual paper cups or mini muffin liners inside an airtight container and store in refrigerator up to 2 weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.\nPulse chocolate sandwich cookies in a food processor until they are fine crumbs. Set aside 1/2 cup crumbs in a small bowl. Add cream cheese to remaining crumbs in the food processor; pulse until well combined.\nShape cream cheese mixture into walnut-size balls using dampened hands.\nMelt chocolate and shortening in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, about 1 to 3 minutes.\nDip balls in the chocolate mixture, turning with a fork to completely coat. Lift the truffles out of the chocolate mixture using 2 forks, letting excess chocolate drip into the bowl. Transfer truffles to the prepared baking sheet. Immediately sprinkle reserved cookie crumbs over truffles.\nChill truffles in refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.",
