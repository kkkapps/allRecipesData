    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSpread each biscuit into a 2x4-inch oval using your hands. Brush hot mustard onto each biscuit. Place a sausage link across the short edge of each biscuit oval and roll up lengthwise. Cut each rolled biscuit into 4 round slices. Lay 'bites' onto a baking sheet. Sprinkle each 'bite' with Parmesan cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until biscuits are browned, 18 to 20 minutes.",
