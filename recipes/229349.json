    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPat green beans dry with paper towels if necessary; spread onto a jellyroll pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Use your fingers to coat beans evenly with olive oil and spread them out so they don't overlap.\nRoast in the preheated oven until beans are slightly shriveled and have brown spots, 20 to 25 minutes.",
