    "des": "\"This is always in demand at any football get together. You can make the bites and use any type of sauce you want. Me personally, I like to take a quarter cup of Sweet Baby Ray's\u00c2\u00ae barbecue sauce and a quarter cup of Franks Red Hot\u00c2\u00ae sauce and mix it together.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk flour, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs together in a separate bowl. Dip chicken pieces in the egg; transfer chicken to flour mixture and coat completely.\nHeat oil in a saucepan over medium heat.\nFry coated chicken pieces in the hot oil, working in batches, until no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.\nCombine hot sauce, garlic, and butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until butter is melted and sauce is warm, about 1 minute. Serve hot sauce mixture as a dipping sauce or pour over buffalo chicken bites.",
