Spread the flour out onto a plate. In a shallow bowl, mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined.\nDip the chicken breasts into the flour, and shake off loose flour; dip them into the egg white, then gently press into the seasoned crumbs. Shake off loose crumbs; spray both side of the chicken breasts with the cooking spray. Lay the chicken breasts onto a nonstick baking sheet.\nBake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese; return to oven and bake until the cheese is melted and starting to brown, 1 to 2 more minutes. Serve topped with the hot spaghetti sauce.",
