    "des": "\"I love breakfast. But when you're going gluten-free, wheat-free, or paleo, there aren't a lot of options. This recipe rocks when you need pancakes to save you from a blah breakfast morning. Yes, you can need pancakes. Great with syrup or fruit sauce. Let them cool and spread with cashew butter, sunflower butter, or even preserves for tea!\"",

Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until batter is evenly combined.\nBeat egg whites in a bowl until foamy, about 2 minutes; gently fold into batter.\nHeat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into the skillet and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
