    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nBring water and butter to a boil in a saucepan; stir in stuffing mix. Cover and remove saucepan from heat. Let stand until water is absorbed, 5 minutes; fluff stuffing with a fork.\nPlace flour in a medium bowl. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl. Combine bread crumbs, pecans, salt, and pepper together in a third bowl.\nFill each chicken breast with 1/4 of the stuffing and a provolone cheese slice. Roll each chicken breast around the filling; tie kitchen twine around each rolled breast to keep closed.\nCoat each chicken roll in flour; dip each chicken roll into whisked eggs. Press each chicken roll in the bread crumb-pecan mixture until fully coated.\nPour canola oil into a large skillet to a depth of 1/4 inch and heat until little wisps of smoke rise from the oil.\nFry coated chicken in the hot oil until crust is lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
