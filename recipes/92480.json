    "des": "\"A wrap done by Middle Eastern street vendors - the recipe is surprisingly easy, not a lot of exotic ingredients, and good.  The most difficult part is cutting the meat very thin! These can also be made with beef or lamb.\"",

Pile on the broiled chicken, and dress with Ranch dressing.",
