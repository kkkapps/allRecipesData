    "des": "\"This is a super-easy way to cook these vegetables if you've never tried them before and by far my favorite. Jerusalem artichokes, or sunchokes, are starchy tubers like potatoes and turnips. When roasted, the skin becomes flaky and the flesh becomes tender, but the taste of a sunchoke is slightly nutty and sweet. Cooked sunchokes are best when eaten within 2 days. When raw, they store well in your fridge's vegetable bin, wrapped loosely in a paper towel. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nScrub Jerusalem artichoke tubers and cut out eyes. Cut tubers into 1-inch pieces.\nMix olive oil, thyme, garlic, and sea salt together in a large bowl; add Jerusalem artichoke pieces and toss to coat. Arrange coated pieces in one evenly-spaced layer on a baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven until Jerusalem artichokes are tender, 35 to 45 minutes.",
