    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCombine curry paste and olive oil in a small bowl. Rinse chicken and dry with paper towels. Gently separate skin from meat over the chicken's breast and legs. Rub the cavity of the chicken with curry paste mixture and rub more curry mixture under the skin. Place onion quarters in the chicken cavity. Rub remaining paste all over chicken. Place chicken on a rack set inside a roasting pan.\nRoast in the preheated oven until skin is browned, the juices run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into a chicken thigh, not touching bone, reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 2 hours.",
