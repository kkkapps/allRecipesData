    "ins": "Place sausage in a bowl. Add ginger and garlic and gently knead into the sausage; don't overwork.\nHeat oil in large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, breaking into small pieces, until browned and crumbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a clean bowl with a slotted spoon, reserving fat in the skillet.\nIncrease heat to high. Cook mushrooms in sausage fat, stirring often until liquid releases and mushrooms begin to brown, about 4 minutes. Add 1/2 of the cabbage. Cook and stir until cabbage is wilted and tender, about 4 minutes. Drizzle in vinegar and soy sauce. Continue cooking until liquid is reduced and skillet is nearly dry, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nMix in sausage, remaining cabbage, and chives. Drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with tortillas, hoisin sauce, and sriracha sauce to make individual wraps.",
