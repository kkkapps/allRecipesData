    "des": "\"Peeling an acorn squash is the key to this delicious dish that's cooked in a microwave.  A fast and easy delight for busy families.\"",
    "ins": "To easily peel the acorn squash without losing a lot of vegetable, gently drop the squash in a large pot of boiling water, and boil for 15 minutes.  Pour off the boiling water and fill with cold water and let sit 5 minutes to cool.  When cool enough to handle, use a knife to slice off the peel on the ridges and use a teaspoon to dig out the peel in the valleys.  Slice the squash in half and remove the seeds and stem.  Then slice the halves into sections and finally cut into 1 inch chunks.\nPlace the squash chunks into a large microwave-safe bowl along with the apples. Dot with pieces of butter. Sprinkle the brown sugar, walnuts, salt and cinnamon over the top. Cover with plastic wrap, and poke a few holes in it for ventilation.\nCook in the microwave for 7 1/2 minutes on full power. Remove, uncover, and stir. Return to the microwave, and cook for another 7 1/2 minutes on full power, until tender. Serve hot.",
