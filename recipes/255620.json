    "des": "\"Gooey, green goodness! You can go large and do monster-sized russets, adapt them into a potato skin-style serving, or make an elegant presentation with fingerlings.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pierce the potatoes in a couple of places with a sharp knife; place on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until a knife easily slices through the potato, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool potatoes for 10 minutes.\nSlice potatoes horizontally; scoop out the flesh with a fork, leaving the skin intact. Mix potato flesh with spinach artichoke dip in a bowl; spoon back into the potato skins and top with Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the oven until cheese is beginning to melt, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn on oven's broiler and broil until cheese begin to bubble and brown, 2 to 5 minutes.",
