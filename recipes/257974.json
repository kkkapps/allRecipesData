    "des": "\"At lease once a week my family enjoys these subs. Shaved steak, sharp American cheese, fresh mushrooms on soft toasted scala sub rolls, and I serve them with steak fries with chicken gravy and bread n' butter pickles...and an ice cold beer for the adults. Add ketchup or any veggies like green leafy lettuce, fresh tomatoes, mayo, or blue cheese dressing. We like ours with a squirt of ketchup on the side for dipping. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until tender, about 5 minutes. Add steak, increase heat to high, and season with soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir steak mixture until hot and sizzling, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cover.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nPlace rolls under broiler until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Layer 2 slices American cheese onto each roll and spoon in steak-mushroom mixture.",
