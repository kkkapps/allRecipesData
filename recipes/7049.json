    "des": "\"This is for a pumpkin quick bread that has cream cheese in the middle.  I generally double it, and then it makes three 8 X 4 inch loaves.   This recipe freezes well.\"",
    "ins": "Blend cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 beaten egg.  Set aside.\nCombine flour, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, baking soda, salt, and spices.  Set aside.\nCombine pumpkin, butter or margarine, beaten egg, and water.  Add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture, mixing just until moistened.  Reserve 2 cups of the pumpkin batter.  Pour the remaining batter into a greased and floured  9 x 5 inch loaf pan.  Pour cream cheese mixture over pumpkin batter, and top with reserved pumpkin batter.  Cut through batter several times with a knife for a swirl effect.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 70 minutes, or until tester comes out clean.  Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, and then remove from pan to cool completely.",
