    "ins": "Warm a 10-inch skillet on medium heat, coat with cooking spray.\nPlace 1 piece of the flat bread in the pan and top with 4 slices of the cheese. Follow with half the slices of Smoked Andouille, and half of the red pepper strips, avocado slices, and shredded carrots filling in a circular pattern. Top with half the salsa. Finish with 4 more pieces of the cheese and a piece of flat bread.\nAllow the bottom to brown and heat through well, 4 - 5 minutes. Pre-heat broiler.\nOnce well browned, spray top tortilla with cooking spray and place quesadilla under broiler to nicely brown the top. Use a watchful eye for this step, since the top can brown quickly. Allow to rest for 3 - 5 minutes.\nPlace a large platter over the pan and carefully flip over. Slice into 8 wedges and serve with a dollop of sour cream.\nRepeat to make second quesadilla.",
