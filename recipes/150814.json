    "des": "\"Multiply this basic recipe for sweet potatoes topped with zesty poblano soy butter, and serve a crowd. You can bake, steam, or cook the sweet potatoes in a microwave. Use a food processor or blender to prepare the soy spread, or simply mix the topping ingredients in a bowl. Regular butter can also be used.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pierce the sweet potato in several places with a fork.\nRoast the sweet potato in preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nMeanwhile, place the poblano pepper, soy butter, lime juice, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Process until well blended, about 1 minute. If not using immediately, place poblano-soy butter in a covered container and refrigerate up to 1 month.\nTo serve, slice the sweet potato in half and spread with 1 tablespoon poblano butter.",
