    "des": "\"I get bored of regular red sauce meatloaf. I've combined my version of holiday stuffing and turned it into a meatloaf. This alternative is delicious and full of veggies and apples. Instead of using bread crumbs, crackers, or oatmeal, try Pepperidge Farm\u00c2\u00ae Herb Seasoned Stuffing! Perfect for fall-winter comfort-style dinners. Pairs well with traditional mashed potatoes and dinner rolls. After experimenting several times over the course of a few years, I've come up with what I call 'Meatloaf Stuffing'. You can use ground beef if meatloaf meat is not available. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix meatloaf meat, apples, onion, stuffing mix, celery, milk, water, eggs, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until ingredients are evenly combined.\nSpread cream of mushroom soup into a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Spoon meat mixture into the loaf pan and use a spatula to gently flatten the top of the loaf.\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cool in pan for 5 to 10 minutes.\nFlip meatloaf pan upside-down onto a serving platter so the cream of mushroom soup is on the top of the loaf.",
