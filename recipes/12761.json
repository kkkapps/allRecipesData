    "des": "\"This salmon is coated with a thick layer of pesto, sort of like icing on a cake. The prepared side is then placed under the broiler, and the pesto forms a browned crust. Equally good cold--the entire dish can be made a day in advance for cold  service, or the leftovers served cold at lunch the next day. Goes well with rosemary and garlic roasted red potatoes and any green vegetable.\"",
    "ins": "Lightly oil a baking pan large enough to accommodate the fish.  Place salmon in pan skin side down.  Run finger over flesh to make sure all bones have been removed.  Use pliers to pull out any that remain.  Squeeze juice of one lemon and white wine over fish.  Marinate 15 minutes.\nPreheat broiler.\nCoat the top side of the fish with thick layer of pesto.  It should be between an 1/8th to a 1/4 of an inch thick, and cover the surface of the fish.\nPlace fish under the broiler about nine inches from heat source.  Broil for 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness, or until fish flakes and flesh is opaque.  Pesto should have formed a heavily browned crust. Remove from the oven, and set aside for a few minutes.  Squeeze half of second lemon over fish.  Slice remaining lemon half into thin slices.  Place lemon slices on individual servings, or arrange on the whole flank if serving at the table.",
