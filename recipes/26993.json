    "des": "\"This fast, easy dip can be served as a main dish or as an appetizer. Depending on the ingredients, it can be mild to medium. This really needs to be served warm, as it has a layer of cheese that gets firm when cool. It reheats well, but is best when fresh. Serve with plain tortilla chips.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain well, stir in chili powder and continue cooking 5 minutes.\nIn a 8x8 inch baking dish, spread the refried beans. Layer beans with ground beef and chili powder mixture.  Top with layers of onion, green chile peppers, picante sauce, Muenster cheese and Monterey Jack cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven 35 to 45 minutes, until cheese is melted and lightly browned. Top with sour cream before serving.",
