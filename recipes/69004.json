    "des": "\"These wonderful homemade heroes are very popular with everyone. To save yourself hassel, you can always make up the sausage the day before for quick assembling. Feel free to substitute pork for the chicken. If desired, slip opened loaf under broiler for 3-5 minutes until cheese is melted.\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, mix the ground chicken, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, sun-dried tomatoes, parsley, fennel seeds, pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Form into 8 links.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet, and cook the sausage links 10 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.\nHeat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion and garlic about 5 minutes, until tender. Stir in the green bell pepper and red bell pepper. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until tender. Sprinkle with vinegar and season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.\nPlace sausages on the bottom of the loaf of bread, cover with the vegetables, and layer with provolone cheese. Form a long sandwich by replacing the top of the loaf, and cut into slices to serve.",
