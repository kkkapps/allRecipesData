    "des": "\"I adapted this from a 50-year-old peach crisp recipe. Although it works well with peaches, it works even better with fresh, crisp cooking apples.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.\nArrange apple slices evenly in prepared baking dish. Sift flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal; sprinkle over apples.\nBake in preheated oven until topping is golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.",
