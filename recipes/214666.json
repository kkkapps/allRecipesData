    "des": "\"Using instant potato flakes and an instant pancake mix for my starter, I'm always ready for my B-and-B guests. Works great if you're cooking for 2 or 20. Great by themselves -- or top with bacon, poached egg, and cheese (we like applesauce on the side, also.) Great finger food, just fold it over a slice of cheese or bacon.\n\"",
    "ins": "Stir together the potato flakes, pancake mix, onion, Cheddar cheese, milk, egg, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl until well combined.\nGrease a griddle or large skillet, and place over medium heat. Drop pancakes, 1/4 cup at a time, onto the hot griddle, and cook until the edges look dry and 1 bubble appears in the center, about 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 more minutes.",
