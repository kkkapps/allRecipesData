Cover; chill dough several hours or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nDivide dough into thirds.  On lightly floured surface, roll out dough, one section at a time.  (Keep the other sections refrigerated.)  Cut out with cookie cutter to desired shapes.\nPlace on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake until firm, but not brown, about 12 minutes. If desired, sift additional confectioners' sugar over slightly warm cookies.",
