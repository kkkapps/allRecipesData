Brush tops lightly with additional water; sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.\nBake according to package directions.\nMix 1/2 cup water and granulated sugar in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened, to a syrup-like consistency. Remove from heat; cool slightly. Stir in remaining 2 teaspoons vanilla. Pour over the fruit in large bowl; toss gently to coat.\nSplit biscuits horizontally in half. Place bottom halves of biscuits on 6 dessert plates; cover evenly with half of the fruit mixture. Top each with a serving of Reddi-wip and top half of biscuit.
