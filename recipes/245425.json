    "des": "\"This thin flatbread is a great alternative to tortillas and considering it is an unleavened type of bread it is pretty fast and easy to make. It can be served as a wrap or accompaniment to salads and barbeque. It is especially great when served with Middle-Eastern-style dishes.\"",
    "ins": "Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, onion powder, and salt together in a large bowl.\nMix yogurt, sour cream, and olive oil together in a separate bowl; stir in dried mint. Pour over flour mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until well-combined.\nTurn dough out onto a well-floured work surface. Knead dough until smooth and elastic, dusting with flour until it is no longer sticky, 8 to 10 minutes. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest, about 10 minutes.\nDivide dough into 6 small balls and roll each piece out into a thin circle.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brush with vegetable oil. Carefully transfer one flatbread into the hot skillet. Cook until bottom side is golden brown and slightly charred, about 1 minute. Brush raw side with oil and flip. Cook until golden, about 30 seconds. Transfer to serving dish. Repeat with remaining flatbreads.",
