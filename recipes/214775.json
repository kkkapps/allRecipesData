    "des": "\"This is a recipe shared with me by my Mom, shared with her by her Mom. Grandmom was the wife of a career Navy man. An incredible woman! The mother of 6 children, lovingly raising the future of the world, loving my Grandfather and supporting our freedom. She would move their children and worldly possessions to be as close to my Grandfather as they could be, whenever and wherever the Navy needed Grandpop. Eventually they settled in NJ, known far and wide for its awesome produce, especially its blueberries. It just reminds me Of Mom and Grandmom's love and devotion to their families. Scoop a biscuit into a bowl and spoon blueberry sauce over biscuit, top with the chilled vanilla pudding, and oh my! Enjoy! Heaven on earth!\n\"",
    "ins": "Whisk the pudding and 2 cups milk together in a bowl until thickened, about 2 minutes. Refrigerate the pudding until serving time.\nMix blueberries and 1/2 cup sugar in a large saucepan, and pour in enough water to just barely cover the berries. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer while you make the biscuits.\nTo make drop biscuits, mix flour, baking powder, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, and pour in vegetable oil and 1 cup of milk. Stir until the mixture forms a soft dough.\nBring the berry mixture back to a boil, and drop the biscuit dough into the boiling blueberries by heaping spoonfuls. Cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until the biscuit dough is cooked through, about 15 minutes. A knife inserted into a dumpling will come out clean. To serve, scoop a biscuit into a serving bowl, spoon blueberry sauce over, and top with chilled vanilla pudding.",
