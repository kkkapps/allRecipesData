    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCook the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until thoroughly browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain excess fat. Mix in the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and green chilies; return to medium heat, and simmer for about 10 more minutes.\nSpread 2 tortillas with refried beans; stack the two tortillas into the bottom of an 8x10-inch baking dish. Top with about 1/4 of the meat mixture, and sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon of Cheddar cheese, or as desired. Spread 2 more tortillas with refried beans, lay them over the cheese, and continue layering the casserole as before with meat mixture, cheese, and tortillas spread with beans. End with 1 tablespoon of cheese, or more to taste.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling and the cheese has melted and begun to brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
