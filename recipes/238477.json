    "des": "\"Great dish. I had it while I was in Korea and had to bring it back with me; the recipe that is. The dish is ready after 30 minutes, but the cucumbers become infused with more flavor after 12 to 24 hours.\"",

Let cucumbers stand at room temperature until liquid has been extracted, about 30 minutes; drain.\nCombine scallions, vinegar, garlic, ginger, chile oil, Korean chile powder, sugar, and fish sauce in a non-reactive bowl.\nStir cucumbers into the vinegar mixture; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate cucumber mixture until chilled and flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes.",
