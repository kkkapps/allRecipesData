Add ground beef, luncheon meat, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and liquid smoke; cook and stir until beef is browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer beef mixture to a plate lined with paper towels using a slotted spoon.\nStir bean sprouts, mushrooms, scallions, carrots, and half of the cilantro into the grease in the skillet. Cook and stir until bean sprouts are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Return beef mixture to the skillet; stir until reheated, about 2 minutes.\nMix beef and bean sprout mixture into the fettucine in the bowl. Garnish with remaining cilantro.",
