    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender; drain.\nIn the meantime, cut the tofu into 1/4 inch thick by 2 inch wide slices.  Heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat.  Cook the garlic and onions and cook until they begin to soften, about 1 minute.  Stir in the mushrooms, walnuts, vinegar, and black pepper, turn heat to medium-low and allow to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.  Gently fold in the tofu slices, cover, and allow to simmer for about 5 minutes more.\nWhen the pasta has cooked, toss it with the tofu mixture, and sprinkle with Romano cheese.",
