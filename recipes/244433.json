    "des": "\"Using only two ingredients, this ice cream recipe consistently produces thick, creamy ice cream. It can be made fat-free or sugar free in any flavor available in a pudding mix. This recipe is ideal for busy cooks, children, elderly people, diabetics, or dieters who cannot find sugar-free ice cream they like, or anyone who wants to impress guests with little effort. This recipe has been tested in a Cuisinart\u00c2\u00ae\u00c2\u00ae 2-quart electric ice cream maker, the kind where you freeze the bowl overnight and do not need ice or salt. This ice cream tastes like very good commercial ice cream.\"",
