    "des": "\"If you have never prepared lamb burgers, I highly recommend you try this recipe. Serve on hamburger buns with lots of mango chutney and cream cheese. Also good with lettuce, tomato and red onion.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nMix the lamb, egg, oregano, sherry, vinegar, red pepper flakes, garlic, green onions, mint, cilantro, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper together in a mixing bowl with your hands until evenly blended. Form into five patties.\nCook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on buns.",
