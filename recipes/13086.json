    "des": "\"Best done with fresh ripe tomatoes, but also very good with canned tomatoes. If you use fresh herbs, you will need more than dried (in proportion, 3 times more). I ate this soup for the first time when I visited an aunt. She made this just for me. Over the years, I made my own version to match the taste I remembered. Here it is. Bon appetit.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan, heat the tomatoes and cut them in small pieces. (If you use the fresh ones, put the tomatoes into a boiling bath until the peel cracks. Peel them and proceed the same way)\nHeat the 2 cups of milk in another saucepan.\nMix flour, salt, pepper, sugar and 1/4 cup milk in a small dish until smooth. Stir the flour mixture into the simmering milk until it thickens. DO NOT BOIL.\nStir the baking soda into the hot tomatoes. When the fizzing slows down, add slowly to the hot milk. Simmer a few minutes, adding basil, oregano, and marjoram to taste.\nNote: If you want a creamy cream of tomato, you will have to put your tomatoes through a sieve or a food processor before you mix them with the milk.",
