    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.\nWhisk milk and lemon juice together in a bowl. Beat vegetable oil, egg whites, lemon zest, and vanilla extract into milk mixture.\nCombine gluten-free baking flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add milk mixture to flour mixture; beat on medium speed with an electric mixer until batter is well mixed, about 2 minutes. Spoon batter into lined cups to about 3/4-full.\nBake in the preheated oven until tops are a light golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool cupcakes in the muffin tin for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
