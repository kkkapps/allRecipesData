    "des": "\"Ireland has so many wonderful tastes to please the palate. Of all of those great culinary delights, Irish Stew would have to be a favorite of mine. Apparently, my family agrees, because a pot full of 'Irish Stew, My Way' doesn't last long around this house. Served inside a bread bowl or with fresh dinner rolls on the side, it is a hearty and savory meal. Give it a try.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place 1 onion in skillet, and season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Mix in garlic. Cook and stir until tender. Mix in the lamb and pork, and cook until evenly brown. Reduce heat to low, and pour in beef broth. Simmer 30 minutes.\nTransfer the skillet mixture to a large pot. Mix in the carrots, turnip, parsnips, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, green bell pepper, remaining onion, and celery. Pour in the beer. Cover, and cook 2 hours over low heat.\nRemove 1/2 cup stew liquid. Stir potatoes into pot, and continue cooking 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. About 15 minutes before serving, mix cornstarch into the reserved liquid. Stir into the stew to thicken.",
