    "des": "\"This is a great recipe for rice that comes out perfect every time.  I serve it with grilled meats such as pork tenderloin, but it complements any recipe. I use medium grain rice because it has a fuller texture, but long grain works fine.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nIn a  medium saucepan heat water and bullion to a slow boil over medium-high heat.  In a large oven safe skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Saute onions until transparent.  Increase heat to high and add butter and rice.  Stir constantly until the rice becomes starchy, about 3 minutes, and then carefully pour the chicken bouillon stock into the skillet.\nPlace the skillet in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
