    "ins": "Grease an 8-inch square baking pan lightly with cooking spray.\nBring energy drink to a boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce to a gentle simmer; stir in gelatin until completely dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.\nPour vodka into the gelatin mixture; stir gently to combine. Pour into the prepared baking pan.\nRefrigerate gelatin mixture until set, about 6 hours. Run a knife under hot water to make it easier to cut gelatin mixture into 2-inch squares.",
