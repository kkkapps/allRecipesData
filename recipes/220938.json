    "des": "\"My mom made this for Easter one year, and I actually liked it! I was a tough critic as a kid, but I've always loved this cake. Now I can make it myself as a dessert-loving adult, but I love it more when my mom makes it! I've never been much of a fan of desserts containing fruit, but this one just gets me! It's just fruit juice, essentially, so it's made to please your toughest fruit dessert critic.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nGrease a 9x13-inch cake pan.\nMix lemon cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir apricot nectar into the batter and mix well.\nPour batter into the prepared cake pan.\nBake in preheated oven until the cake is lightly browned at the edges and the top springs back when lightly pressed, about 30 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean or with moist crumbs. Check for doneness after 20 minutes.\nCool cake completely.\nMix confectioners' sugar with lemon juice, mixing juice in about 1 tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is fluid and easy to spread. Frosting should run slightly but not be a thin runny glaze.\nSpread frosting on cooled cake and sprinkle with lemon zest to serve.",
