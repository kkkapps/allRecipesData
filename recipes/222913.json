    "des": "\"Quick to make and very filling! This is vegan-friendly and can be also be made gluten-free. I love the combination of peanut butter and coconut milk. You can easily double this recipe to make a larger quantity. For potlucks, I spread the cooked rice in a casserole dish and layer the curry on top.\"",
    "ins": "Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.\nMeanwhile, stir coconut milk and peanut butter together in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until the peanut butter melts and the mixture is smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chickpeas, ginger, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until the chickpeas are tender, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes; continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Serve with the rice.",
