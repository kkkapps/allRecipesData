Mix in just enough water to make the mixture sticky. Cover, and refrigerate for three days, mixing once a day.\nOn the fourth day, preheat the oven to 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Form the mixture into 2 inch rolls, and place them on a baking sheet.\nBake for 6 hours in the preheated oven, until firm and cooked through. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until needed.",
