    "des": "\"This is a great recipe from Tampa, where I loved the Cuban restaurants.  I had this soup in several restaurants before I found the recipe!  If you have a small army to feed, you may add a few potatoes and stalks of celery.  I have never done that even when serving for several teenage boys!!  This soup freezes well.\"",
    "ins": "Place a stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Fry the salt pork for a few minutes to release some liquid. Add onion, and saute until translucent. Stir in the navy beans and turnip greens. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 30 minutes. Serve with home made pepper vinegar and a side of cornbread for restaurant-style dining.",
