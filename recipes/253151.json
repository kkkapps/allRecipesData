    "ins": "Cut the pound cake in medium-size slices.\nScoop a ball of ice cream and wrap completely with the slices of cake, patching where needed with smaller pieces.\nWrap the balls tightly with plastic wrap, forming a round shape. Freeze at least 5 hours or overnight.\nHeat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy pan.\nStir cold sparkling water very slowly into the flour; whisk in the egg to create the batter.\nRemove the ice cream balls, one at the time, from the freezer. Dust the surface with flour. Dip into the batter, coating completely. Quickly lower coated ice cream balls into the oil; fry until golden, about 25 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon.\nServe with a drizzle of chocolate sauce before ice cream melts!",
