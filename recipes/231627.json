    "des": "\"Steamed lentils mixed with a chimichurri sauce. \nThis recipe, I discovered, is quite good in many ways. It is a favorite in our home on baked Yukon gold potatoes or stuffed in a whole wheat pita with sliced cucumbers. You will most likely find a favorite way to enjoy this healthy, high-fiber salad.\"",
    "ins": "Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add lentils, cover, and steam, adding more water as needed, until tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer cooked lentils to a serving bowl.\nBlend oil, vinegar, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and salt in a blender until well incorporated. Add parsley and cilantro; pulse only long enough to incorporate the herbs.\nDrizzle 3 tablespoons chimichurri sauce over lentils; add feta cheese to salad. Toss to evenly coat. Store remaining sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for another use.",
