    "des": "\"Red lentils are my favorite. I was craving something lentil-y and found a recipe that \n\nwas just what i wanted after I changed it up a little. I topped them with cherry tomatoes and garlic sprouts. I will totally make this again, it was so amazing!\"",
    "ins": "Combine water and lentils in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until the water is completely absorbed and the lentils tender yet holding form, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer lentils to a large bowl and let cool.\nStir onion, cilantro, garlic, mustard, cumin, parsley, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes into the lentils; add flour as needed to help absorb excess moisture and bind ingredients together. Shape lentil mixture into 4 patties.\nPrepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.\nCook burgers in the hot skillet until firm and hot in the center, 4 to 7 minutes per side.",
