    "ins": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the luncheon meat, and cook until it browns along the edges, about 5 minutes. Pour in the corn and peas, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 to 10 minutes until the flavors are well incorporated, stirring occasionally.",
