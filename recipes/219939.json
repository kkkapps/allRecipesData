Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes.\nStir in the cream of chicken soup and the Cheddar cheese soup; bring soup back to a simmer.\nStir in the processed cheese and allow to melt. When it has melted, slowly mix in the pepperjack and sharp Cheddar cheeses, a little at a time, allowing each addition to melt into the soup before adding the next.\nSimmer the soup over low heat until the cheese has completely melted and the flavors have blended, 15 to 20 more minutes.",
