    "des": "\"These meatballs are easy to make and taste fantastic. Pork meatballs are deep-fried until golden, then simmered in a seasoned chicken stock. Garnish with cilantro and enjoy with freshly cooked rice.\"",
    "ins": "Combine pork, eggs, 1/2 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch, spring onions, ginger, salt, and soy sauce in a large bowl. Mix well and form into 8 balls.\nHeat oil in a large wok over medium heat. Cook meatballs in the hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.\nDrain all but 2 tablespoons oil from the wok. Return meatballs to the wok; add enough chicken broth to just cover meatballs. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.\nMix remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch with water in a bowl. Stir into the wok until chicken broth thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish.",
