Add onion and garlic; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until onion is translucent.  Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, and salt.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.\nIn a medium bowl, blend together ricotta, mozzarella, egg, black pepper, and nutmeg.\nCover the bottom of a 2 1/2 quart baking dish with about 1 cup of the tomato sauce.  Layer with half of the ziti, half of the cheese mixture, 2 more cups of the tomato sauce, and remaining ziti.  Top with remaining cheese mixture and sauce.\nBake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until sauce is bubbly and cheese is melted.",
