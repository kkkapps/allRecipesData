    "des": "\"These are best cooked on the grill, but you can remove them from the marinade and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees. This marinade is excellent on prime rib, fish or chicken. Serve with a crispy salad and garlic cheese potatoes for a great dinner!\"",
    "ins": "Process brown sugar, bourbon, soy sauce, and garlic in a food processor or blender to mince garlic with other ingredients.  Pour over ribs, and marinate for several hours in the refrigerator.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate.\nPlace ribs on grate, and cover. Cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on thickness of your ribs. When finished, the internal temperature of the ribs should be 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer.",
