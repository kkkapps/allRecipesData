Blend on high speed until smooth.\nPour sauce into a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the shrimp and parsley; cook until shrimp are pink and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.\nDrain the linguini, and place on a serving platter.  Spoon the shrimp and sauce over the pasta, and top with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.",
