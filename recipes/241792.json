    "des": "\"Zoodles (zucchini noodles) are all the rage and I keep looking for new ways to prepare them. I decided to combine my love of Greek salad with the zoodles and came up with this recipe. A great alternative to high-carb pasta salads!\"",

Place \"zoodles\" in a large bowl and top with cucumber, tomatoes, olives, red onion, and feta cheese.\nWhisk olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; pour over \"zoodle\" mixture and toss to coat. Marinate salad in refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.",
