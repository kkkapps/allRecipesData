    "ins": "Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add onions and saute until golden brown, stirring frequently. Continue cooking over medium-low heat until onions turn deeper brown, 35 to 45 minutes. If they start to burn, reduce heat. When completely caramelized, remove skillet from heat.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nCut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast. Evenly stuff pockets with 1 or 2 slices of Gouda cheese (depending on size of breast) and 1 tablespoon caramelized onions.\nPlace seasoned coating mix in a shallow dish. Evenly dip each chicken breast in coating mix and place on prepared baking sheet.\nBake in preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
