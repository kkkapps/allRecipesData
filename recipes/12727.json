    "des": "\"Fresh salmon needs very little preparation. These salmon fillets are cooked in good, sweet butter and minced garlic, and then sprinkled with a little lemon juice. If you'd like a little more kick and a fancy presentation, caramelize onions and serve them atop the cooked salmon.\"",
    "ins": "Season salmon fillets on both sides with lemon pepper.\nIn a large skillet, melt butter over medium high heat.  Stir in garlic.  Place salmon in pan.  Cook for 10 minutes per inch of thickness, or until fish flakes when tested with a fork.  Flip fillets halfway through cooking to brown on both sides.  Sprinkle with lemon juice before serving.",
