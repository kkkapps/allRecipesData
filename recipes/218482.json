    "ins": "Whisk the soy sauce, sugar, ginger, mustard powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Whisk in the vegetable oil, then stir in the venison cubes until evenly covered in the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours. Place the wooden skewers into water to soak.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nWhile the grill is heating, remove the venison from the marinade, and squeeze off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Thread the venison cubes onto the skewers, alternating with the onion, jalapeno, and bell pepper.\nCook the skewers on the preheated grill, turning occasionally until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 10 minutes total for medium-rare.",
