    "des": "\"This recipe is so popular with family and friends. I love making it, and it's so easy and delicious. It's so good with grilled corn on the cob and a potato salad. If I use chicken breasts, I cut the breasts into chunks after grilling and mix the grilled chicken into Fettucine Alfredo. It's so good!\"",
    "ins": "Wash chicken parts. Pat dry thoroughly. Pierce all pieces with a fork. In a small bowl, combine the seasoning salt, ground black pepper and cayenne pepper. Rub all chicken parts with the spices, then place the chicken into a large, resealable plastic bag.\nIn a separate medium bowl, combine the lime juice, olive oil, garlic and cilantro. Mix well and pour into the bag with the chicken. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil grate.\nRemove chicken from the refrigerator and pour marinade into a small saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil for about 1 to 2 minutes.\nGrill chicken for about 1 1/2 hours. Brush with the marinade every 15 minutes. Chicken is done when juices run clear.",
