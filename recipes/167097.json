    "ins": "Break the salmon into large but still bite-sized chunks and set aside.\nBoil the new potatoes for about 15 minutes in salted water, till they are just cooked through (you can run a sharp knife through one) but not falling apart.\nDrain completely, and then cut into bite-sized chunks.  Place in a large bowl and pour half of the dressing over them.\nAdd the egg wedges, beans, olives, tomatoes and salmon chunks. Drizzle vinaigrette to taste, then salt and pepper as desired. Gently stir together and serve warm.",
