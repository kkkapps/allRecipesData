Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator 1 hour.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove the shrimp from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Thread about 4 shrimp onto each skewer.\nCook on the preheated grill until pink on the outside and no longer translucent in the center, about 3 minutes per side.",
