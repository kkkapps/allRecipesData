    "des": "\"Bacon and cheese add to this dish inspired by the famous one at Outback Steakhouse\u00c2\u00ae, but with a twist! Now you can make it at home! Best served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies with applesauce for dessert.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace chicken breasts in a baking dish. Season with salt and pepper.\nBake chicken in the preheated oven until it is just slightly pink in the center, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium heat, turning occasionally, until most of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Wrap around chicken breasts.\nReturn chicken to the oven and continue baking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and bacon is crispy, about 15 minutes more. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top; bake until melted, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve with limes.",
