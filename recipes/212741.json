    "des": "\"This is the best brisket you will ever taste.  No matter who comes for dinner, they always make sure that I'll be making this brisket.  It is a very traditional dish for Rosh Hashanah and Passover but it certainly is a winner any time of the year for anyone who loves very tender beef.\"",
    "ins": "Heat brisket in a large skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook until browned on all sides. Stir in water, ketchup, vinegar, onions, garlic, brown sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue simmering until tender, turning brisket occasionally, 2 hours and 30 minutes to 3 hours and 30 minutes.\nRemove brisket and allow to cool before slicing the meat against the grain. Place brisket slices in a 9x13 inch baking pan or large platter and pour gravy on top. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove any excess fat and reheat before serving.",
