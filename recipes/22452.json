    "ins": "Preheat the broiler.\nPlace bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown but still soft. Drain, slice into thirds and set aside.\nSlice each tomato into 6 slices, then halve the slices. Halve the onion slices. Cut the cheese slices into thirds.\nOn a large baking sheet, arrange the bread slices in a single layer. Top with cheese, tomato, onion and bacon.\nBroil 5 minutes, or until the bacon is golden brown.",
