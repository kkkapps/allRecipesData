Combine the salt and flour; stir into the sugar mixture with your hands until a smooth dough forms. Roll dough into log shaped pieces about 1/2 inch thick and 2 to 3 inches long. Dip each piece in the beaten eggs, then in remaining 1/2 cup sugar and then roll them in almonds. Place them 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
