    "des": "\"I don't like sweet potatoes, but this is good tasting and almost good for you.  I love the convenience of plastic wrapped sweet potatoes that cook in the microwave for 4 minutes.  Baking your own would work too.\"",
    "ins": "Wrap the sweet potatoes with plastic wrap, and place into the microwave. Cook on High until the sweet potatoes are tender, about 4 minutes, depending on the microwave. Unwrap the potatoes, and refrigerate until cool enough to handle.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a small baking dish.\nBring the pomegranate juice, water, vinegar, sugar, and cinnamon to a simmer in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut into large cubes; place into the prepared baking dish, and dot with the cubed butter. Pour the pomegranate sauce evenly overtop.\nBake in preheated oven 30 minutes until the pomegranate sauce has thickened into a glaze. Gently stir the potatoes occasionally as they bake to coat them in the glaze.",
