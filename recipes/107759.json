    "des": "\"I tasted many salads with similar ingredients, but all seemed very bland, so I developed this myself. It is dressed with a lime vinaigrette and has lots of crunch and flavor with a little jalapeno pop. It's wonderful to make in summer with fresh ingredients from the garden or farmer's market. This is great with BBQ's or for potlucks. My husband likes it best with fish tacos.\"",
    "ins": "Place the beans, tomato, bell pepper, corn, onion, jicama, jalapeno pepper, and feta cheese in a large salad bowl.\nMash the garlic and salt together with a mortar and pestle. Whisk together the mashed garlic, lime juice, mustard, and pepper in a small bowl. Add the oil in a slow, steady stream while whisking. Continue whisking until smooth. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Chill overnight.",
