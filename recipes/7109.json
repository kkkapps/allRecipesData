Process briefly to blend ingredients. Drop in chunks of butter and pulse to cut in. Stop when you have a coarse, grainy mixture. Alternately you can do this by had with a pastry blender or two knives.\nRemove mixture to a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center. Stir in buttermilk/egg mixture. Blend in dried cherries. Stir with a fork to make a soft dough.\nTurn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead only to get a slightly cohesive dough. Divide the dough into 3 equal size pieces. Pat each piece into an 8 to 10 inch circle, 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Cut each circle into eight wedges. Place on baking sheet. Paint tops with beaten egg white and garnish with about 1 teaspoon of the sugar.\nBake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.",
