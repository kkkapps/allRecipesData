    "des": "\"A roasted tomato stuffed with couscous, fresh mozzarella, and basil makes a wonderful side dish. It's very pleasing to the eye and the mouth.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.\nPour boiling water over couscous in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let couscous soak until the water is completely absorbed, about 5 minutes.\nSlice the tops from tomatoes and take a very small slice of the bottoms so they will be stable upright. Use a spoon to remove and discard the tomato innards. Put tomatoes in the prepared baking dish.\nBake tomatoes in the preheated oven until lightly charred at the edges, about 20 minutes.\nLine the inner walls of each tomato with 4 basil leaves.\nToss mozzarella cheese with the couscous; stuff into tomatoes. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over the top of the stuffed tomatoes.",
