    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1/2 cup onion and garlic, and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped bell pepper, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, then season with salt, chili powder, sugar, black pepper, glove, and a bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nWhile the sauce is simmering, microwave the peppers until tender, about 45 seconds. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat, and add ground beef. Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, then stir in 1/4 cup onion, and celery. Drain off grease. Cook another 5 minutes, then fold in the rice and Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nPreheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nTo assemble, stir about 1/2 cup of the Creole sauce into the beef mixture to moisten it. Stuff the peppers with the beef mixture, and place onto a 9x9 inch baking pan. Pour the remaining Creole sauce over the peppers.\nBake peppers, uncovered, until hot and beginning to brown, about 25 minutes.",
