    "ins": "Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower florets, and cook uncovered for 4 to 6 minutes until just tender. Drain well and set aside.\nHeat the olive oil in the saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the drained cauliflower, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and salt. Cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes, then pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the cauliflower is very tender, 15 or 20 minutes.\nPour the mixture into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the cauliflower moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the cauliflower right in the cooking pot. Stir in the cream, and cook over medium-low heat until hot. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg.",
