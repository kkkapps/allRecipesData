Add honey; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors are combined, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nHeat tortillas one at a time in a microwave until pliable, about 8 seconds.\nSpoon some of the banana mixture onto the bottom third of a tortilla. Fold in opposing edges and roll tortilla up tightly like a burrito, securing ends with toothpicks. Repeat with remaining mixture and tortillas.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry tortillas until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.",
