    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nPlace the flour in a bowl. Combine the eggs and milk in a separate bowl, mixing together well, and then place the bread crumbs in another separate bowl. To the bread crumbs stir in the lemon pepper, parsley, garlic powder, dill and Italian-style seasoning.\nDip each chop into the flour, shaking off any excess flour, then dip into the egg/milk mixture, and, finally, dredge each chop liberally in the bread crumbs.\nLay the chops into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and pour water as needed into the dish, enough to just cover the bottom.\nBake for 40 minutes, then reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 20 more minutes.",
