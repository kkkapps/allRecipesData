    "ins": "Mix the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, milk, egg, onion, ketchup, salt, Pimenton de la Vera, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined; divide the mixture into 12 equal ball shapes. Place in refrigerator for 3 hours to allow the flavors to meld.\nHeat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the meatballs in the skillet, flattening them with the back of a spatula as they cook, about 7 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).",
