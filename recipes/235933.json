    "des": "\"Tasty lemonade with a creamy twist. I love this summertime treat, it hits the spot on hot days. Typically this drink is made with sweetened condensed milk, but using cream of coconut instead not only gives it more tropical flavor, but also makes it a dairy-free treat. Limes, not lemons you wonder? That is simply how Brazilian 'lemonade' is made.\"",

Pour mixture through a strainer into a pitcher.\nStir cream of coconut into lime mixture.",
