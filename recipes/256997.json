    "ins": "Place white and wheat flour in a large bowl. Add salt, yeast, and water. Mix until a wet sticky dough comes together, about 5 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl. Cover with foil. Allow dough to rise for 18 hours at room temperature. It should not be too warm.\nPunch dough down with a spatula and fold it over a few times.\nLightly oil a heavy rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil. Sprinkle generously with cornmeal.\nLightly spray a work surface with water. Place a long sheet of plastic wrap on the damp surface to hold it in place. Sprinkle plastic wrap with flour. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough. Gently stretch and pull dough into a long, flat rectangular shape, 12 to 15 inches long. Bring plastic sheet to edge of prepared pan and flip the dough into the prepared pan. Reshape the dough, if necessary. Dust with flour. Cover with a light dry towel. Let rise about 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nBake dough in preheated oven until loaf is nicely browned, 35 to 45 minutes.",
