    "des": "\"Maple syrup adds a nice flavor to the apples and pears. I have actually used a variety of different apples, depending on what I had on hand, with the same great results. The apple/pear sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 6 months.\"",
    "ins": "Combine Cortland apples, Golden Delicious apples, and Bartlett pears together in a large, microwave-safe bowl. Add water, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the apple-pear mixture and toss to coat.\nCover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and cut a 1-inch slot in the center of the plastic wrap to allow steam to escape.\nCook apple mixture in the microwave on high for 10 minutes. Carefully remove and discard plastic wrap. Stir apple mixture. Cook in the microwave on high until fruit is hot and tender, another 6 minutes.\nStir maple syrup into fruit mixture. Cool completely before refrigerating.",
