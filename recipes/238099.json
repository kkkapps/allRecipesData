    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove onion and garlic to a small bowl.\nStir chicken into any remaining oil in the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Return onion mixture to the pot; add beans, broth, chiles, cilantro, salt, and cayenne pepper.\nBring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the beans are very tender and the chicken cooked through, about 20 minutes.",
