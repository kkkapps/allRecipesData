    "ins": "Snip apricots into small strips. Sprinkle with water and let stand in a sealed container overnight.\nCombine eggs, sugar, and apricots. In a lightly buttered skillet cook the apricot mixture over low heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the nuts, vanilla wafer crumbs and 1/2 of the coconut.\nShape mixture into small balls. Roll balls in the remaining coconut. Store in a tightly covered box. These taste best after aging for a few days.",
