    "des": "\"This is a recipe dictated to me after much pestering from my best friend Shelly from Bangladesh who never writes anything down. The unique thing about THIS curry is that one day she accidentally used corned beef and it was FANTASTIC (you may use brisket beef or lamb instead), so I have adapted it to the recipe. Trust me, when you eat this beef curry you will never want to try another, it's THAT good!\"",
    "ins": "In a pot, bring the basmati rice and 3 cups water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.\nHeat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Brown the corned beef in the saucepan, and cook the onion and garlic until tender. Season with ginger, turmeric, coriander, salt, chili powder, cinnamon, and cardamom.\nPlace the bay leaves in the saucepan, and pour in 1 cup water. Bring to a boil. Mix in the potatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes. Stir occasionally, and add more water as needed to keep the ingredients moist.\nCover the saucepan, and continue cooking 10 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Serve the beef and potato mixture over the basmati rice.",
