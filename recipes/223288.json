    "ins": "Beat 1/2 cup margarine, 1 1/2 cups potato flour, ice water, and salt together in a bowl with an electric mixer until mixture is large crumbs. Form into a ball of dough; chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.\nStir blackberries, sugar, 1/3 cup potato flour, and lime juice together in a bowl.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSeparate dough into two equal halves. Roll each half with a rolling pin to 12 inches in diameter. Press one crust in a 9-inch pie pan. Scoop blackberry filling into the prepared pan. Drizzle 3 tablespoons margarine over blackberry filling.\nLightly press the other pie crust on top of the blackberry filling and seal the edges to the bottom layer's edges. Brush top crust with remaining 1 tablespoon melted margarine. Cut 2 or 3 slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.\nBake pie in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and blackberries are bubbling, about 40 minutes.",
