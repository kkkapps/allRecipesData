    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.\nHeat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until onion begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Pour 1/4 cup wine into the skillet; scrape up any browned bits of food with wooden spoon.\nStir sausage into onion mixture; pour remaining wine in gradually as mixture becomes dry. Cook until sausage is thoroughly browned; 7 to 10 minutes. Add broccolini; cook and stir until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes more. Add pasta; toss to combine. Stir in Parmesan, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Top with additional Parmesan to serve.",
