    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nArrange garlic cloves on a baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over garlic.\nBake garlic in preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring once to prevent burning. Remove from oven and allow to cool.\nPlace cooled garlic and 1/2 cup olive oil in a food processor; blend until mixture is a paste.\nSeason steaks with salt and pepper. Rub garlic paste on both sides of each steak.\nPlace a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the steaks until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 5 minutes per side. Remove the whole pan from the heat and let stand until steaks reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), or your desired degree of doneness.",
