    "ins": "In a saucepan, bring the water, bulgur, and soy sauce to a boil. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside for 10 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.\nGrind cashews and sunflower seeds in a food processor to a fine meal.\nIn a large bowl, mix the cooked bulgur, ground cashews and sunflower seeds, eggs, chili powder, garlic, and hot pepper sauce. Cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours to blend flavors.\nPrepare the grill for medium heat.\nForm the bulgur mixture into 6 patties. To prevent the patties from crumbling, spray a piece of foil with cooking spray, and place on the grill. Grill the patties 10 minutes, turning once, or until heated through and browned. Cooking time may vary according to thickness of patties and heat level.",
