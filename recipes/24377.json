    "des": "\"This is what you call a wickedly delicious, vegetarian spaghetti sauce which tastes like a bolognaise but is really soybeans.  I also use this sauce with jacket potatoes (and if I'm really feeling naughty, add a bit of shredded mozzarella cheese on top), rice or even, 'cause it's so thick, just on its own.   For optimum flavor use dried soya, if available.\"",
    "ins": "Cover soybeans with water and soak for several hours, or overnight.\nIn a slow cooker combine soybeans, tomatoes, onion, okra, green olives, black olives, tomato paste, chopped tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, wine, olive oil, corn, oregano, basil, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  Mix well.\nCook on low for 12 to 24 hours, stirring occasionally.",
