Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\nArrange baguette slices in a single layer on the baking sheet. Place under broiler until golden, 2 minutes. Turn each slice over and broil 2 minutes. Turn off broiler.\nTurn each slice over again; drizzle with olive oil. Push chocolate piece into the center of each slice and return baking sheet to oven for 2 more minutes. Remove from oven and lightly sprinkle each chocolate piece with sea salt.",
