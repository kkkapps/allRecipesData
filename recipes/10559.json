To Make Filling:  Combine ground walnuts, ground almonds, sesame seeds and honey together in a bowl.  Mix until well coated.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nRoll out dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 3 inch squares.  Place 1 heaping teaspoon of filling in center of each square.  Moisten edges with orange flower water or orange juice and cover the filling by folding in the four corners and pressing them firmly together in the center.\nBake for about 25 minutes.  While cookies are still warm, sprinkle lightly with orange flower water or orange juice and dip in a bowl of confectioners' sugar.",
