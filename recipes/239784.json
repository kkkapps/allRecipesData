Be sure to tear the cheese sticks in half as irregularly as possible, as this really gives it that stomach-turning realism. You can use ketchup instead of hot sauce, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Round off the ends of each cheese stick with a paring knife to resemble a fingertip. Roughly tear each cheese stick in half to form two torn-off \"fingers\".\nShave off a piece of each cheese \"fingertip\" to form a nail bed; place an almond slice on the \"nail bed\" to form a \"fingernail\".\nCut a few shallow lines in center of each \"finger\" to form knuckle marks.\nPour several drops of hot sauce into small pools of \"blood\" on a serving plate. Dip torn ends of the cheese fingers into \"blood\" to resemble bloody fingers. Lay each \"finger\" in its own pool of \"blood\".",
