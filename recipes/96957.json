    "des": "\"This dish is simple, tasty, and-best of all-fast. I've made it with both peeled and unpeeled shrimp. Unpeeled was definitely messier to eat, but I think on the whole the unpeeled shrimp were a little juicier. This recipe is tasty without the tequila, too. I love garlic, so I use an insane amount of it in this dish.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the garlic in the hot oil until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the shrimp, tequila, and lime juice; cook until the shrimp turn pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle the cilantro over the shrimp; toss to combine; peel and eat.",
