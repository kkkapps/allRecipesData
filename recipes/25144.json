    "des": "\"A mixture of ground meat, egg, onion, tomato sauce and cracker crumbs baked with a tangy 'sauce' of vinegar, mustard and brown sugar. Recipe lists ground lamb, but can be made with any ground meat. This is the best meatloaf recipe.  People who hate meatloaf love this one! No ketchup needed!!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl combine the ground meat, egg, onion, 1/2 cup tomato sauce and cracker crumbs. Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix well; press mixture into a loaf pan and make a depression in the center. Set aside.\nIn a small bowl combine the remaining 1/2 cup tomato sauce, vinegar, mustard, brown sugar and water. Mix together until sugar has dissolved and pour liquid over meatloaf.\nBake in preheated oven for 1 hour.",
