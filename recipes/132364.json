    "des": "\"I ate this with rice or coconut roti almost every evening in Sri Lanka-- I could not get enough of it!  Using fresh ingredients is of the utmost importance.  Some of the ingredients may be difficult to find, but they really are essential. This goes very well with rice as a vegetarian entree or alone as a side dish.\n\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, serrano pepper, garlic, and curry leaves in the oil until the onions are golden brown. Stir in the curry powder, fenugreek seeds, turmeric, and salt; cook another 3 minutes. Add the green beans to the mixture and stir until evenly coated. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the beans are al dente. Pour in the coconut milk and simmer at least 5 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in the lime juice just before serving.",
