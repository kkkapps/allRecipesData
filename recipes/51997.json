Transfer remaining marinade to a small saucepan, and cook on the stove over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.\nBrush grate with oil, and place meat on grate. Grill pork, basting with reserved marinade, for approximately 15 to 25 minutes, or until interior is no longer pink. Avoid using high temperatures as marinade will burn.",
