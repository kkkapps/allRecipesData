    "ins": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat. Add chorizo and cook, gently breaking it up after a couple minutes. Allow it to bubble, stirring infrequently, until most of the bubbles have stopped and sausage is firm. Remove from heat.\nPlace tomatoes into a bowl. Break into smaller pieces with the back of a fork, if desired.\nDivide dough into 16 small pieces, flattening each into a small circle. Place each circle on prepared baking sheet. Divide tomatoes and then the chorizo among the circles. Top with shredded Monterey Jack and crumbled cotija cheese.\nBake in preheated oven until dough is golden brown and cheese has melted, 8 to 15 minutes. Check after 8 minutes to ensure chorizo is not burning.\nTop with minced cilantro leaves.",
