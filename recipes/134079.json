    "des": "\"This is a delicious, quick sauce to serve with grilled steaks or a roast.  I got this recipe from my sister whose husband gave it the name 'Romance Sauce',  when she cooked this with steaks he knew it was going to be a special night.  Serve the steaks with a green salad and a simple vinaigrette; this is an easy, romantic meal sure to impress the ladies!  You could easily substitute the beef stock with chicken and serve over chicken breasts if beef isn't your thing.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and onions, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the onions soften and turn translucent. Add the dill, thyme, salt, and pepper; cook for 30 seconds to flavor the onion.\nStir in the Dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, and beef stock. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat then reduce heat to low, and continue simmering for 5 minutes to infuse the flavors. Remove sauce from the heat, and whisk in sour cream; season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.",
