    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nSpread potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet; drizzle with the oil, and toss to coat. Season with salt. Place potatoes in preheated oven and bake until very tender when pierced with a fork, 45 to 50 minutes.\nWith a small knife, cut a cross in the top of each potato; press firmly on sides to open. Combine sour cream and Gorgonzola in a small bowl. Top each potato with a generous spoonful of the cheese mixture; garnish with chives. Serve hot or at room temperature.",
