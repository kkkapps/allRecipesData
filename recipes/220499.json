    "des": "\"This was a recipe my Mom had and we ate it every St. Patrick's Day.  An alternative recipe for St. Patrick's Day for those who don't care for corned beef and cabbage.  Cooked together in one pot and boy is it juicy! My mom is Irish and hated the traditional corned beef, potatoes, and cabbage version. She got the basis for this recipe from her Italian Mother in Law. Add a nice warm crusty roll, butter, and a pint of Guinness or Pinot Noir and you got yourself a hearty meal to celebrate the Irish!\"",
    "ins": "Place smoked pork butt in a 6-quart pot with enough water to cover; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 hour.\nStir in potatoes and cabbage. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.\nRemove pork from soup and cut into quarters; return pork to pot until ready to serve. Season with more salt and pepper, if needed.",
