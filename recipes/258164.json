    "ins": "Combine avocado, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and salt in a bowl; mix gently to avoid mashing the avocado.\nPosition egg roll wrappers on a flat work surface so that 1 corner is pointing toward you. Place 1/3 of the avocado mixture 1 inch from the bottom corner and sides of each wrapper; wrap up halfway. Brush the exposed corners and edges of the wrappers with beaten egg; roll up completely. Press down lightly on rolls to ensure they are sealed.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Fry egg rolls until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels.",
