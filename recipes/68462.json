    "des": "\"A great meaty loaf with no bread, so it's great for low-carb diets. Tasty and sure to satisfy! This beef and pork sausage meatloaf is loaded with pepper jack cheese, bacon, chopped pistachios, and spinach.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until bacon is crisp and onions are transparent. Drain off excess grease, and set aside to cool.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, pork sausage, bacon and onions, spinach, olives, pistachio nuts, 1 cup of ketchup, eggs, and meatloaf seasoning until well blended. Pat meat into a loaf shape, and place in a large baking pan. A roasting pan will work well. Poke cheese cubes into the top of the loaf so they are completely covered. Brush remaining ketchup generously over the top.\nBake for  1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature of the loaf is 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).",
