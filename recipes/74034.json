    "ins": "In a small bowl, mix together the lemon juice and mint. Set aside.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the asparagus into the boiling water for about 45 seconds, then remove to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain the asparagus, and place on a serving plate. Drizzle with the lemon mixture, and sprinkle cheese over the top.",
