    "des": "\"A fellow spear-fisherman gave me this recipe as a way to take advantage of some of the stronger tasting fish that we bring up off of the Carolina Coast. I have used both Cobia and Amberjack to make this recipe and both were sensational. You will need large fillets to make this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCut cobia fillets into long strips about 1/2-inch thick and 18-inches long.\nPlace a strip of bacon atop each strip of fish. Starting at one end, begin to roll the layered strips into a flat coil like a pinwheel or the classic-style lollipop. Thread onto metal skewers to keep together.\nCook on preheated grill, basting with barbecue sauce, until the fish is firm and flaky and the bacon is cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.",
