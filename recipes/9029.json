    "des": "\"Nothing like the Mediterranean tastes of tomato, onion, bell peppers and of course chicken! All these tastes bundled up with chili sauce in one slow cooker. Simple, Spanish, scrumptious! Serve with asparagus and corn over plain white rice, if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Place chicken in a large slow cooker.  Pour in enough boiling water to completely cover the chicken, and add 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Cover, and set slow cooker to HIGH. Cook until the chicken meat turns white.\nAdd the peppers and onions. Simmer until peppers and onions get a little tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, chili sauce, and ketchup. Cover, set slow cooker to LOW, and cook for about 6 hours.",
