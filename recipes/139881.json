    "des": "\"This carrot cake uses very little sugar and is very fragrant and sweet from molasses and dried figs that I use as a substitute for sugar. Citrus fruit and spices give it very fresh taste. It is a very moist and tasty cake.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch Bundt pan.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, cake flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, carob, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

Mix until the dry ingredients are moistened, then stir in the orange zest, lemon zest, raisins, figs, poppy seeds, carrots and pecans until evenly distributed. Pour into the prepared pan.\nBake for 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
