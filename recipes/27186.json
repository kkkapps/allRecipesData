    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace apples, 1/2 cup sugar, lemon zest and wine in a heavy saucepan.  Pour in water to cover completely.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered 15 minutes.\nPlace raisins in a small bowl and cover with water. Let soak 10 minutes, then drain and reserve.\nIn a small bowl, cream together butter and remaining sugar until well combined. Coat the bottom and sides of a 2-quart baking dish with this butter mixture.\nButter the top edge of each slice of bread. Starting from the bottom, roll each slice up into a log, using the buttered edge to seal. Cut 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick slices to form pinwheels. Repeat with remaining bread.\nLine bottom and sides of the greased baking dish with bread rounds. Drain the apples and combine them with the drained raisins. Spoon the fruit mixture into the lined dish. Cover the top with the remaining bread rounds.  Sprinkle with the remaining sugar.\nBake in the preheated oven 1 hour.\nTo serve, pour rum over the warm charlotte and light it with a long match or kitchen torch.",
