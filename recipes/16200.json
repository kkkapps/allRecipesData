    "des": "\"A favorite Sunday morning breakfast on the island of Trinidad in the Caribbean. Saltfish can be found in many grocery stores, ask your grocer to help you locate it. Serve this dish with sliced hard boiled eggs or simply serve with toast.\"",
    "ins": "To remove excess salt from the fish, bring the fish to a boil in a large pot of water. Drain the water, and repeat the process. Drain the fish, flake, and press liquid out.\nIn a large skillet, saute oil, onions, tomatoes,  and peppers for 2 minutes. Mix in flaked saltfish, lemon juice, and hot pepper. Cook mixture at a low heat until the moisture has almost completely evaporated.\nPile the mixture into the center of a serving dish, and arrange lettuce and avocado around it.",
