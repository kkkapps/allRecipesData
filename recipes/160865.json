    "ins": "To make the marinade, whisk together the red wine, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, honey, garlic, cumin, coriander, onion powder, pepper, and canola oil in a bowl until smooth.\nTo use the marinade, pour over 4 steaks in a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out the air, and massage the bag to coat the meat with the marinade. Refrigerate at least 8 hours before cooking to desired degree of doneness.",
