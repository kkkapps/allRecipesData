Scrape out into a bowl, and stir in the eggs and soy flour until well blended.\nPlace the dough between two pieces of waxed paper, and roll out into about a 12 inch circle. Remove the top piece of waxed paper, and invert the dough into a 9 inch pie plate. Press into the bottom and up the sides. Remove any overhanging dough.\nBake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light golden brown. Use in any recipe calling for a prebaked pie crust.",
