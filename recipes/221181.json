    "des": "\"I devised this simple snack for my Cinco de Mayo Fiesta party years ago.  An instant hit, they get gobbled up so fast that I enlist guests and form an assembly line at the grill, no skillet needed. Guests love being involved in the action.\"",
    "ins": "Heat refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave on high until warmed through, about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute.\nSpray both sides of each corn tortilla with cooking spray and arrange them on a wire rack.\nHeat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Pan-fry one side of each tortilla until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Return tortillas to wire rack, browned sides up.\nSpread a thin layer of refried beans onto the tortillas, stopping about 1/2 inch from the edge.\nSprinkle Mexican cheese blend over refried beans.\nCarefully transfer a tortilla pizza back to the skillet, bean side up.\nLightly fry until cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute more; return tortilla pizza to wire rack. Repeat with remaining pizzas.\nScatter tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, and olives over melted cheese.\nSlice pizzas to serve.",
