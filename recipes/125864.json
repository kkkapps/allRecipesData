Place apples on a cookie sheet covered with lightly greased aluminum foil.\nCombine caramels and water in a saucepan over low heat.  Cook, stirring often, until caramel melts and is smooth. Stir in vanilla extract. Dip each apple into the caramel and gently run apples around insides of saucepan to scrape off some of the caramel.
