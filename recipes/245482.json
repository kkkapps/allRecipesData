    "des": "\"Dry rub for chicken wings to either bake or grill or fry. They go great with beer, blue cheese dressing and celery. I absolutely love spicy food so if you do too you are in for a treat! If they are too hot for you, milk will help with the heat.\"",
    "ins": "Combine cayenne pepper, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, oregano, salt, sugar, black pepper, and cinnamon in a small bowl; mix well to make dry rub.\nPlace chicken wings in a large resealable bag or container. Add dry rub mixture to wings; seal container and shake well until evenly distributed.\nPreheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCook the chicken wings on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the chicken is well-browned and no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes.",
