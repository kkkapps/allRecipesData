    "ins": "Stir miso, mirin, sake, brown sugar, and soy sauce in a shallow dish. Add salmon fillets; turn to coat. Marinate at room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes, or in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nLine a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Transfer fillets onto the baking sheet, reserving marinade.\nPlace bok choy in the marinade; turn to coat. Arrange bok choy next to salmon on the baking sheet, reserving marinade.\nBroil in the preheated oven until salmon is lightly charred on the edges, about 4 minutes. Flip salmon and bok choy; brush with reserved marinade. Continue cooking until salmon is browned and flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes. Transfer salmon to serving plates. Continue cooking bok choy until it is tender-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes more.",
