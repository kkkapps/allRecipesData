    "des": "\"Hot sauce recipe inspired by many others, but unique. Very simple ingredients and easy to make. Has great heat with legs (the heat lasts), good pepper flavor, and the sweet balances the heat. I used salt substitute (66% KCl, 33% NaCl) for low-sodium diet. Servings below are in tablespoons.\"",
    "ins": "Blend habanero peppers, jalapeno peppers, and Fresno peppers in a blender on 'liquefy' setting until smooth. Add water, vinegar, onion, brown sugar, garlic powder, and liquid smoke to pureed peppers. Blend until smooth and liquefied; season with salt. Blend again. Pour chile sauce into a sterilized glass container with a tight seal; refrigerate overnight.",
