    "des": "\"This is a delicious way to use quinoa. It's comfort food with a healthy twist with vegetables and low-calorie cheeses. I adapted it from a recipe found in Eating Well. Although it's gluten-free, it doesn't taste like it.\"",
    "ins": "Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nMix ricotta cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, egg, basil, parsley, and oregano together in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper.\nSpread cooked quinoa in the bottom of the baking dish. Top with 1/3 of the pasta sauce. Cover with zucchini slices and ricotta mixture. Top with another 1/3 of the pasta sauce. Scatter all the spinach on top. Cover with remaining 1/3 of the pasta sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes.",
