    "des": "\"For people like me, who can't make good pancakes, this recipe is perfect. Everything is cooked in the oven in one single skillet, giving the plus of easy clean up. Serve with maple syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nPlace the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, sugar, salt, and flour into a blender. Pulse until no dry lumps remain in the batter. Melt the butter in an 8-inch, cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the batter, and drop in the strawberries.\nPlace the skillet into the oven, and bake until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.",
