    "des": "\"Stuffed beef tongue simmered in tomato sauce. You can serve it with white rice and beans.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add beef tongue; cook until slightly softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Peel off skin.\nMix smoked ham, olives, garlic, adobo, oregano, and salt together in a small bowl.\nMake slits in the tongue using a sharp knife; fill slits with ham mixture.\nHeat oil in the same pot over medium heat. Add tongue; cook, turning often, until browned on all sides, about 20 minutes. Remove from the pot and cut into smaller pieces. Pour tomato sauce into the pot; stir to scrape up browned bits from the bottom. Stir tongue pieces into the sauce and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.",
