    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nWhisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a knife until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nPlace the bowl in the freezer for 5 minutes.\nStir in Greek yogurt until dough is combined. Add 1/4 cup seltzer; mix until dough is smooth. Add more seltzer if dough appears dry.\nPlace dough on a floured piece of parchment paper and pat into a flat rectangle. Fold the rectangle in thirds. Rotate dough 90 degrees, gather any crumbs, and flatten into a rectangle again. Repeat folding, turning, and flattening twice more.\nFlatten dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into twelve 2 1/2-inch rounds. Transfer rounds to a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.",
