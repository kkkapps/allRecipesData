    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes, then stir in the tomatoes, capers, bay leaves, and thyme leaves. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering for 15 minutes. Stir in sage leaves, and simmer 10 minutes more.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and return to the pot off of the heat. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper, then pour over the pasta and toss to coat.",
