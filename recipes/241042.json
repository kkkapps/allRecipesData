    "ins": "Rinse, stem, and slice the strawberries into bite-size pieces.\nHeat the strawberries and 1/3 cup Mott's Fruit Punch Rush in a wide skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir occasionally for about 10 minutes until the strawberries have softened.\nCool the strawberries to room temperature and assemble the parfaits.\nStir the yogurt and remaining 2 tablespoons Mott's Fruit Punch Rush together in a medium bowl.\nSpoon 1/4 cup yogurt into each jar, then top with about 2 tablespoons cooled strawberries. Sprinkle with 1-2 tablespoons granola.\nRepeat with another layer of each ingredient in each jar. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nThe granola in each parfait will stay crunchy for up to 4 hours; after that, it will be soggier but still delicious.",
