Place patties on a broiler pan.\nCook turkey burgers in the preheated broiler until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\nToast hamburger buns in a toaster.\nArrange lettuce leaves on bottom halves of hamburger buns. Place turkey patties and cranberry sauce on top of lettuce and place top half of bun on top.",
