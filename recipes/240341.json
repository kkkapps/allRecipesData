    "des": "\"Every year at the holidays, I make Russian tea cakes. This year, the man in my life said it reminded him of the lemon cookies he used to love so much from a bakery he frequented in another town. I tried several recipes I found online and none were right, so I just made my own instead!\"",

Pour 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar into a shallow bowl.\nCook and stir pine nuts in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer nuts to a food processor and grind until fine.\nBeat butter and cream cheese together with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in 3/4-cup confectioners' sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and lemon extract, respectively, beating well after each addition. Add ground pine nuts and mix until smooth and creamy.\nWhisk flour and salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture and beat until dough is just-combined. Drop dough in small scoops onto a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until cookies are firm and bottoms are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Roll baked cookies in confectioners' sugar in the shallow bowl and place on prepared wire rack to cool.",
