    "ins": "In a large bowl, combine pudding mix and pineapple; mix well.  Add marshmallows and 3/4 of the container of dessert topping (add more to get a creamier consistency).  Toss in the coconut; mix well.  Transfer to a serving dish and top with halved cherries and any extra coconut.  Chill for at least an hour before serving.  Will be good the next day.",
