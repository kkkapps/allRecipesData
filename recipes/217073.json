    "des": "\"This is a great way to sneak in some extra fruit into your breakfast -- whether it be for yourself or for the kids! The strawberries add beautiful color to the pancakes and an extra sweetness. Also great if half a banana is added to the mix. And the topping options are endless! Serve alongside maple syrup, butter, fresh strawberries, blueberries, banana, etc., and enjoy! Brown sugar can be sprinkled on top of the completed pancakes to add a crunchy texture.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat a pancake griddle to medium heat. Whisk together the pancake mix and water in a bowl.\nPlace the still-frozen strawberries into a blender, and pulse several times to break the berries up into small pieces. Mix the chopped strawberries and the frozen blueberries into the batter until the fruit is well distributed.\nGrease the griddle with butter, and pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake onto the griddle. Allow the bottom side to brown and the batter to form air holes; sprinkle the uncooked side with brown sugar, if desired, and flip to brown the other side.",
