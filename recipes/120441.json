    "ins": "In a mixing bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. In a saucepan, heat water and oil to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until blended. Beat in eggs until smooth. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough.\nTurn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place in a grease bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.\nPunch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.\nBake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.",
