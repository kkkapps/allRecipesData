    "des": "\"This is my favorite dessert and will be the favorite of anyone who tries it, I am sure!  You may substitute cubed pound cake for the ladyfingers. This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.\"",
    "ins": "In large mixing bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar with electric mixer until light yellow, 1 minute.  Beat in mascarpone, brandy and vanilla until smooth.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Fold egg whites into mascarpone mixture.\nQuickly dip ladyfingers, one at a time, in cooled coffee and arrange them in a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Use 15 cookies to cover the bottom of the dish.  Spread half the mascarpone mixture over the cookie crust and sprinkle the chocolate on top.  Repeat the soaked cookie and cheese layers.\nCover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight before serving.",
