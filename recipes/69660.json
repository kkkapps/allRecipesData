    "des": "\"A very easy and delicious way to cook pork chops with a sweet, but not too sweet, sauce. I recommend serving the pork chops with white rice since the sauce is also excellent on the rice.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown the pork chops about 5 minutes on each side. Remove chops from the skillet, and set aside.\nMix the chicken broth, soy sauce and vinegar into the skillet, and bring to a boil. Return the pork chops to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove chops from the skillet, reserving broth mixture, and set aside.\nIn a bowl, blend the brown sugar, cornstarch, and pineapple juice. Mix into the skillet with the chicken broth mixture. Bring to a boil. Serve with the cooked pork chops.",
