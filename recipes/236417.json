    "des": "\"What makes a burger Seattle-style? Flannel bun? Uh, no. Micro-brew on the side? Well, okay, probably. Espresso in the aioli? Yes! Don't knock it, it totally works! Just be careful the sauce doesn't get into your hipster beard. For best results, use Beecher's\u00c2\u00ae cheese, Walla Walla onions, Chateau Ste. Michelle\u00c2\u00ae red wine, and Starbucks\u00c2\u00ae espresso. Cook the burgers in a skillet or outside on the grill, preferably in the rain. You hungry, bro?\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in hot oil until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Season vegetable mixture with salt and pepper; continue to saute until onions and mushrooms brown, about 5 minutes more.\nPour the red wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes; remove from heat.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.\nCook burgers until they are firm, hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium well. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).\nWhisk mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, and espresso together in a bowl until aioli is smooth.\nSpread aioli on each hamburger bun. Place a beef patty on the bottom bun, top with a slice of Monterey Jack cheese, 1/4 the onion-mushroom mixture, 1/4 cup arugula, and cover burger with the top bun. Repeat with remaining burgers.",
