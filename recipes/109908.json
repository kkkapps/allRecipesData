Remove the tuna steaks from the marinade, and press into the pea mixture to coat.  Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.\nWhile the sauce is cooking, sear the tuna in a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat to desired doneness.  Pour sauce over tuna to serve.",
