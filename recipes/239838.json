    "des": "\"I just love nuts, especially cashews! So, about 15 years ago I started experimenting with making a cashew cookie based on the Betty Crocker\u00c2\u00ae peanut butter cookie recipe. Over time, I have become gluten-free, so I've also tried a variety of gf flours. Finally, I meet with success! This is a moist cookie that holds up to dunking in tea or coffee with a nutty, light, mildly sweet flavor that is a bit exotic. Make these for afternoon tea parties or pull some out for surprise guests.\"",
    "ins": "Place cashews, 1 tablespoon peanut oil, and 1 teaspoon water in a food processor or blender; pulse until cashews are ground. Add 1 tablespoon water to cashew mixture and pulse until a thick and chunky paste starts to form. Add remaining 1 tablespoon water and 1 teaspoon peanut oil to mixture and pulse until desired consistency is reached. Measure 1/2 cup cashew butter and store remaining cashew butter in a container in the refrigerator for another use.\nMix brown sugar, white sugar, cashew butter, coconut oil, butter, and egg in a large bowl. Combine quinoa flour, baking soda, xanthan gum, cardamom, and mace in a separate bowl; pour into sugar mixture and mix until dough easily forms into a ball. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for 1 1/2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nSpread coconut flakes into a shallow bowl. Form cookie dough into small round balls using a spring-loaded scoop. Roll each cookie dough ball in the coconut and arrange on a baking sheet. Press each ball with a fork dipped in quinoa flour, making a criss-cross pattern.\nBake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned on the edges, about 8 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
