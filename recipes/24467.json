    "des": "\"Shortbread cookies with chocolate chips and pecans. If you don't like pecans, you  could add toasted coconut instead. Don't be put off by the amount of butter, this  recipe makes a very large batch.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and 2 cups confectioners' sugar. Beat in the vanilla and coconut extracts and salt. Add flour one cup at a time, mixing well after each. Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans. Roll the dough into 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten with a fork dipped in confectioners' sugar.\nBake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until a light golden brown. While cookies are still warm from the oven, dust with the remaining confectioners' sugar.",
