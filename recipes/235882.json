    "des": "\"My smallest loves pancakes but I hated to constantly make him those enriched flour and unhealthy pancakes. So as I entered my journey into paleo I discovered these absolutely heavenly pancakes and have modified the recipe to make them even more perfect. Now I don't have to feel like a bad mom when I make him his favorite almost everyday.\"",
    "ins": "Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil on a griddle set to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) or a skillet over medium heat.\nPlace bananas in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add eggs, 3 tablespoons coconut oil, vanilla extract, salt, and baking soda; beat until batter is smooth and fluffy.\nGently ladle batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the hot griddle; sprinkle with cinnamon and arrange walnuts on each pancake. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 4 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more coconut oil between batches.",
