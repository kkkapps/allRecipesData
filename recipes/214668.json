    "des": "\"If you are interested in a little bit of heat, but not too much, this is a great recipe for you. I used a mortar and pestle to form the spice paste, but you can easily use a small bowl and the back side of a spoon. Be sure to pair it with sides that counteract the heat. I served this alongside rice with peas and onions mixed in. It was perfect! The salad that I served the chicken on top of, Green Chile and Tomato Salad, is also another recipe of mine on this site. Check it out!\"",
    "ins": "Place the smoked paprika, garlic, cumin, caraway seeds, chipotle pepper, and adobo sauce into a mortar, and grind together with a pestle to make a paste. Smear the paste all over the chicken breasts, place into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.\nRemove chicken from marinade, and discard the excess marinade. Brush the chicken breasts with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill the chicken breasts until the meat shows grill marks and the inside is no longer pink, about 5 minutes per side.",
