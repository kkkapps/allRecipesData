    "ins": "Heat a non-stick skillet or wok over medium. Toast the pine nuts stirring constantly to keep from burning, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.\nReturn the skillet to medium heat; add butter and crushed red pepper; stir until butter melts. Stir in spiralized zucchini. Saute, flipping lightly throughout the cooking process. When the zoodles are al dente (about 5 minutes), transfer them to a serving dish or plate. Top with shaved cheese and reserved pine nuts.",
