    "des": "\"This is a simple recipe, yet it is the best black bean soup I've tried.  I have   been lucky to get home smoked ham, and used the bone from it.  I've   also made it with smoked ham hocks I've gotten from the butcher.  Of  course the home smoked ham makes the soup superlative, the butcher bone made it wonderful.  Either way, I think you'll enjoy it.  It can be made spicy if that's the way you prefer it.  It can also be topped with sour cream.\"",
    "ins": "Soak the beans overnight in a pan of water.\nDrain off the soaking water. Simmer beans in 8 cups of water until soft.\nWhile the beans are cooking, saute the chopped onion and celery in margarine until golden. Add the vegetables to the soup pot along with bay leaves, parsley, salt, pepper, and ham bone. Cook over medium heat for 3 hours, adding water if needed.\nAfter the beans are cooked and soft, remove the ham. Set aside. Cool soup, and puree in batches. Return the soup to the pot, and add dry sherry.\nCut the meat off the bone, and add the meat to the soup. Cook over low heat until warmed through, and adjust seasonings.",
