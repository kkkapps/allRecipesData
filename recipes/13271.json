    "des": "\"This mushroom soup is really simple, and makes a thick, creamy textured soup.  Water can be added after cooking to make a thinner soup, or try adding cream if you like.  I make this in a wok but you can use a stock pot, whichever you have available.  Serve hot with toast.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a wok over medium heat, and saute mushrooms, onion, and celery or carrot in the oil for 10 minutes.\nAdd chicken or vegetable stock, rice, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, and simmer for at least an hour.\nTake mushrooms, onion, celery and rice out of the soup. Using a blender or food processor, blend until smooth. Stir back into wok. Season with salt and pepper, and serve hot.",
