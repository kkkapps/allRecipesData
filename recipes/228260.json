    "des": "\"Perfect recipe for those who enjoy eating delicious food more than preparing it! Letting the frozen vegetables thaw instead of cooking them cuts down on the prep time and helps keep them crisp. Feel free to mix and match with different types of beans; I've also used garbanzo beans, white beans, black-eyed peas, and kidney beans in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Combine green beans, lima beans, red beans, red bell pepper, and onion in a large bowl with a tight-fitting lid.\nMix together canola oil, apple cider vinegar, sugar, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Pour mixture over bean mixture. Seal lid and shake bowl until evenly coated. Refrigerate for 24 hours or until all ingredients are completely thawed. Shake well before serving.",
