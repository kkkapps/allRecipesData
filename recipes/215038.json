    "des": "\"Very different from a regular salad. This is a salad my whole family enjoys, including my 8- and 9-year old. Peas are readily available all year round; when it's in season, I have also used asparagus, zucchini, green or wax beans.  It's also nice to put some fresh cracked pepper over it when it is done. I have tried this recipe with canned beets. It does not come out nearly as well, the beets are way to soft.\"",
    "ins": "Place the beets into a saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the beets are easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving the bacon drippings in the skillet. Roughly chop the bacon and set aside.\nAdd the drained beets and red Swiss chard to the reserved bacon drippings; cover the skillet, place over medium heat, and cook until the chard is tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir the chopped bacon and frozen peas into the beet mixture; continue cooking until the peas are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the feta cheese over the mixture; stir. Serve hot.",
