    "des": "\"This recipe is a new version of green bean casserole. It uses fresh green beans that are topped with delicious caramelized onions, Parmesan cheese, and grape tomatoes.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook green beans at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and transfer to a 9x13-inch dish.\nCook and stir onions, vinegar, garlic, sugar, basil, and oregano in a skillet over medium heat until onions are softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until onions are very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSpread onion mixture over green beans and top with Parmesan cheese. Arrange tomatoes, cut sides down, atop Parmesan cheese layer.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 35 minutes.",
