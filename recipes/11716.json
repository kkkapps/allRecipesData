    "des": "\"This is a recipe I made up. I like using all fresh ingredients when in season, like pureed tomatoes for the tomato juice. But it is really good with the canned stuff. I'll make up a bunch and freeze. Makes for a quick meal, just to heat and serve over spaghetti.  Also good for any recipe calling for tomato sauce.\"",
