    "des": "\"These little parcels are made with seasoned ground meat sealed in egg roll wrappers; they are then deep fried. Serve with salsa and guacamole if desired, but plain they are a dream. This recipe was handed down from my grandfather to my mom, from her to me, and now I'm passing it on to you.\"",
    "ins": "In a large, heavy saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add chopped garlic, onions, and bell pepper; saute until soft.\nAdd meat; cook and stir until browned.  Drain off excess fat.   Stir in tomato sauce and cilantro.  Simmer until cilantro wilts.  Remove from heat, and cool until mixture can be handled.\nWrap 2 to 3 tablespoons of meat in an egg roll wrapper to form a triangle. Repeat with remaining ingredients.\nHeat vegetable oil in a wok or deep fry pan to 360 degrees F (168 degrees C). Fry patties in hot oil until golden brown.  When done, transfer to plates lined with paper towels to drain.",
