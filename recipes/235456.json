    "des": "\"This red wine-poached pear with chocolate recipe is a perfect dessert option for the holidays, cold winter nights, or as a show-stopper to impress your friends. Just don't let them know how easy it is to make! Serve with a savory cream like mascarpone, cr\u00c3\u00a8me fraiche, or Devonshire cream. Can be made ahead of time and refrigerated.\"",
    "ins": "Cut bottom off each pear and core from the bottom to give each pear a flat bottom to stand upright.\nCombine wine, water, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and star anise in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and arrange pears on their sides in the saucepan. Simmer pears for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn pears and continue simmering until tender and easily poked with a fork, 8 to 10 minutes. Work in batches if needed.\nRemove pears from wine mixture and place in a serving dish, standing upright. Continue boiling wine sauce until reduced to about 3/4 cup, 5 to 10 more minutes.\nFill each pear's core cavity with chocolate sauce. Pour wine sauce over each pear.",
