    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain noodles and return to the pot. Pour olive oil and salt over the drained noodles; stir.\nPut processed cheese food cubes into a large, microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until melted and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes; pour over noodles and add tuna, peas, celery soup, mushroom soup, and black pepper. Stir to coat noodles completely; pour into a large casserole dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top of the noodle mixture to cover completely.\nBake in preheated oven until Parmesan cheese just begins to brown, 20 to 30 minutes.",
