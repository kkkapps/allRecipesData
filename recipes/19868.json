Stir in the chocolate mixture and coffee liqueur. Fold in the flour. Stir in chopped walnuts if desired. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.\nBake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out almost clean. Be careful not to overbake. Cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting into bars and serving.",
