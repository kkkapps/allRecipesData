    "ins": "Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat; add mushrooms and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat to cool.\nPreheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions.\nSpread an even layer of tomato sauce onto the cut sides of each ciabatta roll. Sprinkle equal amounts of garlic and oregano onto each roll. Place 2 salami slices side by side onto each roll; top each with 2 slices ham. Divide red onion, mushrooms, red pepper, olives, and basil between the 4 sandwiches and spread evenly atop the meats. Finish by topping with provolone cheese and sandwiching roll halves around the fillings.\nCook sandwiches on preheated panini press until there are dark brown grill marks on the bread, the cheese is melted, and the center is warm, about 5 minutes.",
