    "des": "\"This tangy, fruity side dish looks beautiful served hot out of the oven. If you don't want to heat up the oven, the carrots are pretty good simply simmered for 5 minutes in the sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nBring carrots and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam until the carrots are just tender, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, stir together the apricot preserves, cornstarch, dried apricots, and raisins in a saucepan. Place over medium heat, and cook until the mixture bubbles, thickens, and turns clear, 2 to 3 minutes.\nOnce the carrots have cooked, drain, and stir into the apricot preserves. Pour into a baking dish, and bake in preheated oven until the sauce has thickened further, and turned light brown, about 15 minutes.",
