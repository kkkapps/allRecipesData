    "des": "\"These cookies are called 'cat's tongues'. They are easy to make. This is a French recipe, but it has already been converted to conventional measurements.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.\nIn a medium bowl, cream together butter and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg whites one at a time until batter is light and fluffy. Stir in the vanilla. Mix in the flour just until blended. Dough will be a little stiff.\nUsing a cookie press or a pastry bag with a medium star tip, press dough onto prepared baking sheet into 3-inch lengths, like a ladyfinger.\nBake cookies in preheated oven until straw-colored, about 10 minutes. Cool on wire rack.\nWhen cookies are cool, dip one end of each cookie in melted chocolate and place on wax paper until chocolate hardens. Store in a cool place.",
