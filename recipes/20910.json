Chop the outsides of the tomatoes\nIn a large pot over low heat, boil the milled liquid and tomato paste  for 1 hour, or until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.\nIn a blender or food processor, puree cilantro, jalapeno, garlic and 1/2 cup of the tomato liquid from the large pot. Slowly stir this mixture into the pot.\nBring the contents of the pot to a boil while mixing in the green peppers, onions, chopped tomatoes, salt, vinegar and brown sugar. In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in water. Add the cornstarch mixture to the pot. Stirring continually, boil the mixture until all the vegetable are soft  -- about 30 minutes.
