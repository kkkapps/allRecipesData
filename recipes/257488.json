Measure 1/4 cup puree into a bowl. Mix in milk and vanilla extract.\nCombine sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to medium; beat in egg whites and whole egg until batter is just blended.\nMix half of the flour mixture into the batter on low speed. Add milk mixture, Champagne, and food coloring; beat just until blended. Beat in remaining flour mixture until batter is just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula to make sure batter is smooth.\nDivide batter among lined muffin cups.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 21 minutes.
