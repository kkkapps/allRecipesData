I add and subtract every time I make it depending on what's in the house. This is the meal to make when you need beef, carbs, and good stuff.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chuck roast in a 9x13 inch baking dish with high sides. Roast for 1 hour in preheated oven. Spoon off any fat that has accumulated.\nCombine the 2 cans of mushroom soup and the chives in a large bowl. Remove roast from oven, and scatter the potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms around the roast. Pour the soup mixture over the meat and vegetables. Cover with aluminum foil.\nReturn the baking dish to the oven to roast for 2 additional hours. Uncover, and sprinkle with the grated Cheddar cheese. Return to the oven until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.",
