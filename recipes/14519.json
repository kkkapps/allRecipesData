    "des": "\"This is a great recipe for a hot summer day, and it looks totally exotic so your guests will be amazed. You may want to spice the chicken up a bit more to add to the contrast between the meat and the fruit. Try adding some crushed chilies to your chicken marinade, or maybe some garam masala! ENJOY\"",
    "ins": "In a shallow glass bowl combine lemon juice, juice from pineapple can, salt, pepper and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Mix together. Add cubed chicken and marinate for 1 hour in the refrigerator.\nPreheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Soak wooden skewers, if you're using them.\nCombine the melted butter, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, brown sugar, and nutmeg in a small bowl.\nUsing metal or soaked wooden skewers, arrange chicken, pineapple chunks, and strawberries on each stick (approximately 4 to 6 pieces of each item per skewer). Brush kabobs with butter mixture. Place the kabobs on the hot grill. Cook, turning on all sides, until chicken is cooked through and strawberries are sizzling, approximately 8 to 10 minutes.",
