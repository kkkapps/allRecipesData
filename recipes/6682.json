    "ins": "Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm. In a large bowl, stir together yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon sugar.  Set aside to proof.\nAdd milk, 2 2/3 tablespoons sugar, salt, butter or margarine, flour, and soup mix to the yeast in the bowl.  Combine until dough forms, and then turn out on a lightly floured surface.   Knead until dough is elastic.  Oil a large bowl.  Place the dough in the bowl, and turn several times to coat.  Cover the bowl with a damp cloth, and set aside in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.\nDivide dough in half.  Shape into loaves, and place into two greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch bread pans.  Set aside to rise for 30 minutes.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 minutes.  Loaf will sound hollow when done.",
