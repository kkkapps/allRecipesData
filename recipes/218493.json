    "des": "\"This is, by far, the best recipe for porcupine meatballs I have ever had. This is a recipe that was given to my mom when she married back in 1970. The recipe also includes cooking directions for stovetop cooking or cooking in the oven. Hope you enjoy as much as our family does.\"",
    "ins": "Mix the ground beef, rice, 1/2 cup water, onion, salt, celery salt, garlic powder, and black pepper in a bowl. Roll the mixture into 12 meatballs.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the meatballs. Cook meatballs, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain and discard any excess grease. Pour the tomato sauce, 1 cup water, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until the meatballs are no longer pink in the center and the rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Stir in more water if the sauce becomes too dry.",
