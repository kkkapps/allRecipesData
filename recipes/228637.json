Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Stir green beans and tomato soup into the ground beef mixture; transfer to prepared casserole dish.\nMash the cooled potatoes with milk, egg, garlic, pepper, and salt; spoon in mounds over the ground beef mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the potatoes.\nBake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and edges of dish begin to brown, 25 to 30 minutes.",
