    "ins": "In a large bowl beat together the shortening and half of the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the sugar, molasses, ginger, cinnamon, egg and vinegar and blend thoroughly. Stir in the remaining flour and mix until smooth. Chill covered for at least 3 hours or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease the mold with vegetable oil or spray. Place the mold in the freezer for 10 minutes.\nRemove the mold from the freezer and press the dough into the mold making sure to press into all the corners. Loosen the edges of the cookie, turn upside down and let fall onto the cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges begin to brown. Cool and decorate with confectioners' sugar, sugar sprinkles, etcetera.",
