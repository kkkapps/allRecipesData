    "des": "\"This tastes just like the tomato basil soup they serve at Applebee's\u00c2\u00ae. The hubs loved it so that's saying something! I always add a pinch of sugar to tomato-based sauce, but I'm not sure that it needed it. Served it with baked fries with seasoned salt and grilled gouda cheese sandwiches on thick crusty bread, panini-style.\"",
