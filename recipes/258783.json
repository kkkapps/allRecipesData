    "ins": "In a small mixing bowl combine butter, soy sauce, cilantro green onion, sesame oil, and ginger. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until combined.\nCarefully peel back corn husks but do not remove. Remove and discard the silk. Gently rinse the corn. Pat dry. Spread about 2 tablespoons of flavored butter over each ear of corn. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Carefully fold husks back around ears. Tie husk tops with 100% cotton kitchen string to secure.\nFor a gas or charcoal grill, grill corn on the rack of a covered grill directly over medium heat for 25 to 30 minutes or until kernels are tender, turning and rearranging ears using long-handle tongs 3 times.\nTo serve, remove string from corn. Peel back husks and tie them in place with additional kitchen string, if desired. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and additional chopped fresh cilantro.",
