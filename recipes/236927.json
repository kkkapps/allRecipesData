    "des": "\"A warm vegan soup that my whole family loves. Totally quick and easy, and super healthy to boot! Add more kale if you don't have picky eaters! Four cups of kale and curry is on the mild side, you can always add more to your taste. We've also served this over leftover pasta for the kids. They love it!\"",
