    "des": "\"Yes, the title says it all! This recipe was created by mistake. While using another recipe as a guide, I made the mistake of using cocktail sauce instead of chili sauce. Well, this was the best darn mistake I have ever made. These pork chops had the most wonderful zip to them! Mistakes like this should happen more often!\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan over medium heat, mix the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, honey, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and cool.\nPlace the pork chops in a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour the soy sauce mixture into the bag, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 to 6 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nDrain the pork chops, and discard remaining marinade. Arrange the pork chops in a baking dish, cover, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven.\nIn a bowl, blend the ketchup, cocktail sauce, brown sugar, water, and mustard. Pour over the pork chops, and continue baking 30 minutes, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
