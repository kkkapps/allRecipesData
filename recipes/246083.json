Ladle custard over caramel.\nTransfer ramekins to a baking dish. Pour enough warm water into the dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins.\nBake in the preheated oven until custard is set, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nArrange ramekins on a baking sheet. Sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar over each custard.\nBroil in the preheated oven until sugar is melted and crisp, about 2 minutes.",
