    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.\nMix cake mix and cherry-flavored cola together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups about 2/3 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until muffins spring back when lightly touched, 18 to 23 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.\nBeat cream in a large bowl using an electric mixer until frothy; beat in confectioners' sugar until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the frosting will form sharp peaks; refrigerate.\nCut a well out of the top center of each cupcake and fill with 2 to 3 cherries from the cherry pie filling. Transfer frosting to a piping bag or a plastic bag with 1 corner cut off. Frost cupcakes and top each with a maraschino cherry.",
