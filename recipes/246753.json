    "des": "\"I got some pea vines at our local farmers' market, and I couldn't find any recipes for them, so I made one up. I was very pleased with how it came out! The ginger/tomato combination was quite tasty, and I think it would be good with a pea vine substitute as well. Serve over rice.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tofu; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in water chestnuts; cook until softened, about 2 minutes.\nStir pea vines and ginger into the skillet; cook and stir until pea vines are wilted, about 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and rice wine. Cook until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.",
