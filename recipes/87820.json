    "des": "\"A good alternative to higher-fat versions of creamed spinach, silken tofu is pureed with milk, cheese, and seasonings, then added to spinach sauteed with onions and garlic. Serve it to anyone, and don't tell them there's tofu in it until they've already eaten some. If you like, pan fry some thinly sliced mushrooms with the onion and garlic, or add some canned mushrooms with the spinach. You could also add a little crushed red pepper for heat and sprinkle some extra cheese on top for serving.\"",
    "ins": "Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook until soft and translucent, but not brown. Add spinach; cook, stirring frequently, until wilted.\nPlace tofu, milk, cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a blender, and puree until smooth.\nStir pureed tofu into spinach. Cook until warmed through. Adjust seasonings, if desired, and serve.",
