    "ins": "Place 24 cookies in a zip top bag and seal it. Finely crush the cookies with a rolling pin. Transfer cookie crumbs to a mixing bowl. Drizzle melted butter over the crumbs; mix well. Press crumbs on the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan, forming a crust.\nPour milk into a saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin on the milk; let stand 1 minute. Place pan over low heat; stir milk until gelatin dissolves, about 3 minutes. Add white chocolate chips; stir until melted, about 3 minutes. Refrigerate until mixture is slightly thickened, about 30 minutes.\nBeat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.\nCoarsely break up or chop 24 cookies. Fold cookie pieces and whipped cream into the white chocolate mixture. Spoon into prepared springform pan. Refrigerate 6 hours or overnight.\nTwist the remaining cookies into 2 rounds each. Garnish cake with cookie halves and fresh raspberries.",
