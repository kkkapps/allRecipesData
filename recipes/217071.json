    "des": "\"These brownies feature neither sugar nor chocolate, rather they are sweetened with honey and use carob powder and brewed tea to give flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the spelt flour, carob powder, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl.\nStir the honey, brewed tea, cream, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl. Add the honey mixture into the flour mixture, and stir to thoroughly combine; pour into an 8x11-inch baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out gummy rather than wet, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool before refrigerating overnight for best results.",
