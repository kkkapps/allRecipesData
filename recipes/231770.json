    "des": "\"A quick gourmet cake that is very moist. I made this for a friend's birthday as a nice alternative to standard birthday cake since she preferred whipped frosting to buttercream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 9-inch round pans.\nCombine dry cake mix and gelatin powder in a large bowl; add 1 package raspberries with juice, eggs, vegetable oil, and hot water. Beat mixture thoroughly; divide batter between prepared round pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.\nFold 1 package thawed frozen raspberries through whipped topping in a bowl; spread about half the frosting evenly over 1 cake, place other cake atop the frosted cake, and frost with remaining frosting. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.\nTop frosted cake with halved strawberries along outer edge and with raspberries in a circular pattern in the middle. Place blackberry in center of cake.",
