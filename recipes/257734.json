    "des": "\"While the name doesn't exactly make the mouth water, the flavor and texture of clotted cream are the stuff of legends. The long, slow cooking sort of toasts the cream, which imparts a sweet, nuttiness that I don't think I've tasted in any other preparation. This is just delicious spread on warm biscuits or scones and topped with homemade jam.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 175 to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).\nPour cream into shallow glass or ceramic baking dish (an 8- or 9-inch square pan is ideal). Cream should be about 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep.\nPlace dish in preheated oven. Bake 12 hours. Do not stir. Carefully remove from oven and let cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or until completely chilled.\nTurn over a corner of the top layer of thickened cream; carefully pour liquid underneath into a container to use for baking.\nPack the thickened (clotted) cream into a ceramic crock or canning jar. Cover and refrigerate up to 5 days.",
