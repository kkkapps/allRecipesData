    "ins": "In a medium bowl, stir together lemon juice and zest with sugar until smooth. Slowly stir in milk. Pour into a 9x9 inch dish and place in freezer, stirring once when it begins to harden; freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.\nYou may also use an ice cream maker. Follow the manufacturer's instructions. When sherbet is soft-serve consistency, serve immediately, or transfer to a container and freeze until firm.",
