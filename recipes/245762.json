    "des": "\"This is a recipe I thought of on a cold Saturday night! I wanted baked potatoes and had a craving for Buffalo chicken too. I just combined the two. These are great! My whole family loves them! We really enjoy these reheated the next day too! Great for a game day party or any cold day! Serve topped with sour cream and extra Buffalo sauce.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place potatoes on a baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until tender when pierced with a fork, checking for doneness after 1 hour and then every 15 minutes, 1 1/2 to 2 hours total.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes.\nCut potatoes in half horizontally. Scoop out potato flesh into a large bowl. Add butter; mix until melted and well-combined. Season with salt and black pepper. Stir in chicken, 2 cups Cheddar cheese and buffalo sauce; mix well to combine. Spoon potato filling back into empty skins. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until filling is hot and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.",
