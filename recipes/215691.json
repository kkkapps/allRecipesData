Since going gluten and casein free I have been unable to find any hot breakfast cereals that we enjoy.  So I created this one and the whole family loves it.  Serve with brown sugar, agave nectar, honey or fruit.\"",

Repeat the process with the quinoa, millet, buckwheat, sesame seeds, and flax seeds. Stir in the cornmeal and amaranth. Store in an air tight container in the refrigerator until ready to cook.",
