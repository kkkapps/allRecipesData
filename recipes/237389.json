Put two large squares of aluminum foil onto a large, flat work surface.\nMake a bed of lemon slices in the center of each foil square; top with red onion. Lay a salmon fillet atop each pile of lemon slices and onion; season with basil, dill, and sea salt. Fold edges of the aluminum foil over the salmon and seal completely.\nBake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.\nRemove salmon from foil pouch, place on plate, and drizzle juices from foil pouch over the fish.",
