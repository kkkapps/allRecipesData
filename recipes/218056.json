    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).  Spread the almonds onto a baking sheet, and toast until the nuts start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, about 45 minutes. Watch the nuts carefully as they bake, they burn quickly. Once toasted, set the nuts aside to cool to room temperature. Finely grind the almonds in a food processor.\nRaise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil a baking sheet with vegetable oil.\nIn a bowl, mix together the ground almonds, oat flour, maple syrup, and almond extract. Form the mixture into 6 balls, then flatten the balls into cookies about 1/4 inch thick. Place cookies onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBake until crisp and brown around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes; watch them carefully because they burn easily. Remove the cookies carefully, and allow to cool.",
