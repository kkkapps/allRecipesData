Add mushrooms; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in artichokes.\nMix chicken broth, white wine, and cornstarch together in a bowl until cornstarch is dissolved. Pour into the skillet slowly, stirring constantly until sauce comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.\nToss chicken mixture with penne in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.",
