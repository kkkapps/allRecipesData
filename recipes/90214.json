Grease a muffin tin, or line with muffin papers.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, thyme, fennel seeds, salt, pepper, and sugar. Make a well in the center, and pour in the soy milk, egg, egg yolk, and oil. Stir just until blended. Spoon into the prepared muffin tin, filling cups about 3/4 full.\nBake for 18 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly pressed. Cool in the pan for at least 5 minutes before removing from cups.",
