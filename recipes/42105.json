    "des": "\"A fluffy seafood-potato salad which can be served anytime.  This is a fancy version of the salad that's on every respectable plate lunch in Hawaii.  Feel free to substitute a can of tuna, a can of baby shrimp, or 1/2 lb. of shredded imitation crabmeat for the real stuff. Note:  Most potato salads in Hawaii do not include mustard\"",
    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook over medium-high heat for 30 minutes, or until tender. Drain, peel and dice while still hot. This is what will make the salad fluffy. Cover and refrigerate until cold.\nIn a large serving bowl, toss together the potatoes, eggs, crabmeat, black olives and carrot. Sprinkle with sugar, and stir in enough mayonnaise to moisten. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Chill until ready to serve.",
