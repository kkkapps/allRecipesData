    "ins": "Beat egg yolks in medium bowl with electric mixer on high speed, 5 minutes or until thick and light yellow.  Gradually beat in sugar.\nHeat cream in medium saucepan over medium heat until just hot to the touch.  A little at a time, so the eggs do not curdle, stir half of the cream into the egg yolk mixture.  Then stir all the egg yolk and cream mixture into the remaining cream in the saucepan.  Cook, stirring continuously, over low heat, 5 to 8 minutes, until mixture thickens; do not boil.  Pour custard into 9 inch pie plate, cover and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours.\nBefore serving, sprinkle with brown sugar and place under preheated oven broiler, or use a kitchen torch to melt sugar.  Serve with berries.",
