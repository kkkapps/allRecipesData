    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.\nSpread half the macaroni into a 9x13-inch casserole dish; top with half the tomatoes and half the Cheddar cheese. Repeat layering with remaining macaroni, tomatoes, and Cheddar cheese. Pour milk over entire casserole; sprinkle with crushed crackers.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crackers are golden, about 30 minutes.",
