    "ins": "Prepare outdoor grill for high heat.\nTrim the tail and fins off of the salmon. Make several shallow cuts across the salmon's skin. Place salmon on 3 large, slightly overlapping sheets of aluminum foil.\nIn a bowl, stir together soy sauce, chile sauce, ginger, and garlic. Mix in lime juice, lime zest, and brown sugar. Spoon sauce over the salmon.\nFold the foil over the salmon, and crimp the edges to seal.\nIf using hot coals, move them to one side of the grill. Place the fish on the side of the grill that does not have coals directly underneath it, and close the lid. If using a gas grill, place the fish on one side, and turn off the flames directly underneath it; close the lid. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove to a serving platter, and pour any juices that may have collected in the foil over the top of the fish. Sprinkle with green onions.",
