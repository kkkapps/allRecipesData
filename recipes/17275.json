    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, cream together the shortening, water, white sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and baking soda, stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips, then fold in the cocoa powder last to create a marbled effect. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
