    "des": "\"This is a great casserole that I threw together one day when a friend requested Broccoli au Gratin for her birthday dinner.  This is a great idea for those who aren't big fans of bread crumbs.  Also, the eggs can be taken out for a great sauce and using skim milk and fat-free cheese works well, too.  It's basically a great recipe that can be easily altered according to taste. Enjoy!\"",

Drain.\nMelt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and add flour; cook until bubbly.  Stir in onion and gradually add milk, stirring well.  Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute.

Combine mixture with broccoli and transfer to a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish.\nBake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.",
