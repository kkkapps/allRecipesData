    "ins": "Whisk tea and cornstarch together in a small bowl; transfer to a saucepan. Add peaches; cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until just boiling, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in white sugar, brown sugar, and nutmeg; simmer over medium-low heat until sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to thicken.",
