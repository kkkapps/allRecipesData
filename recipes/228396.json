While vegetables are draining, place yogurt into a separate colander lined with paper towels and let stand for 4 hours to allow excess whey to drain from the yogurt.\nCombine cucumbers, bell peppers, thickened yogurt, sour cream, vinegar, dill, salt, and black pepper in a large salad bowl; chill before serving.",
