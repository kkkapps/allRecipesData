    "des": "\"If you're like me and hate the rubbery texture of tofu shirataki noodles, this recipe is for you! It's tasty, low-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, and vegetarian. These croquettes are delicious when served with grilled chicken, over shredded lettuce or spinach, or doused with salsa. They will fall apart easily, but are delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Wrap a paper towel around the grated carrots and place in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until tender, about 1 minute. Cool carrots to room temperature and squeeze out as much juice as possible.\nRinse and thoroughly dry the shirataki noodles. Blend in a food processor until the consistency of small grains of rice is reached; transfer to a bowl.\nMix carrots, egg whites, chives, cilantro, curry powder, onion flakes, garlic powder, and salt with the ground noodles until evenly combined.\nCoat a skillet with cooking spray and place skillet over high heat. Drop a heaping spoonful of the noodle mixture into the skillet and gently flatten with a metal spatula. Cook until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining noodle mixture.",
