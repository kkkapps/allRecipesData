    "des": "\"An amazing dessert! You can use figs or dates in this recipe, and you can replace the orange liqueur with Marsala wine if you prefer. Preparation Time: 15 minutes. This recipe is from The WEBB Cooks, articles and recipes by Robyn Webb, courtesy of the American Diabetes Association.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut each fig in half. (If you cannot find fresh figs and would like to use dried figs, cut a little opening in the top of the fig and make a pocket for the stuffing.)\nIn a small mixing bowl, combine chocolate chips, almonds, and wine. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the stuffing mixture into each fig half.\nBake on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes.",
