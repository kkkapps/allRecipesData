    "des": "\"Skirt steak is an inexpensive cut of beef taken from the diaphragm muscle.  It ranks with filet mignon as my favorite juicy and tender cut.  It comes in long, narrow strips about 3/4 lb. each.  The grain runs across the narrow side and so for serving the steak should be cut into serving-size pieces with the grain so that it can then be cut into bites against the grain.\"",
    "ins": "In a small bowl, stir together the lemon juice and mustard. Trim away most of the fat from the steaks, and rub with the mustard marinade. Place into a resealable bag, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and up to 24 hours.\nPreheat a grill or large skillet for medium-high heat.\nGrill or fry steaks for about 5 minutes per side, or to your desired degree of doneness. Remove from the heat, and let the meat rest for 5 to 10 minutes to let the juices settle. Cut each steak along the grain into 3 or 4 pieces.  Serve with blue cheese dressing.",
