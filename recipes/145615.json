Put one piece of asparagus on top of the cheese. Roll each dough triangle around the cheese and asparagus toward the point and press to secure. Arrange on a baking sheet at least  2 inches apart.\nBake in preheated oven until lightly brown, 13 to 18 minutes. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks.
