    "des": "\"I have found that cooking your sauce all day like my father taught me is the best way. In addition to that, I make my sauce this way whether I am making linguine, stuffed shells or lasagna. I like to utilize convenience whenever possible so I use pre minced and jarred herbs. You can use what ever your preference is for meat, whether it be ground turkey meatballs or chicken Italian sausage. It will always be a hit with your family and friends! Try serving with your favorite pasta.\"",
    "ins": "In a large pot saute onion, garlic, oregano and basil in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the neck bones and let simmer with the lid on until the onions are transparent. Note: if using ground beef cook with onion mixture.\nOnce onions are clear, add the tomato sauce, tomatoes, tomato paste and water. If using meat in your recipe add at this time. Cover and simmer for several hours.\nBefore serving, remove neck bones and discard.",
