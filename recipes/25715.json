In Spain they use fresh almonds, just out of their shells, so the taste will be different than the soup you had in Spain unless, of course, you have access to fresh almonds.  Variation:  Use a medium sized yellow melon instead of grapes, sliced into finger sized pieces. Reduce garlic to 3 cloves, don't toast the breadcrumbs and use 1/2 lb. ice, delete the water.\"",
    "ins": "Pound almonds, bread crumbs, garlic and salt together in a mortar to form a paste.  Gradually mix in oil.  Stir in vinegar.  Place mixture in a soup tureen.  Stir in water, ice and grapes.  Let rest in a cool place 30 minutes before serving.",
