Transfer scallops to a plate.\nPour the clam juice into the skillet.\nWhisk together the low-fat milk, flour, white pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until the mixture is smooth; whisk into the clam juice. Reduce heat to low and bring the sauce to a simmer, whisking constantly. Cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.\nReturn the scallops and any accumulated juices to the skillet and stir in the peas until thoroughly combined. Return to a simmer.\nGently mix the cooked fettuccine, 1/2 cup of Romano cheese, chives, lemon zest, and lemon juice into the scallops and sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of Romano cheese to serve.",
