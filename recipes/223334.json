    "des": "\"This recipe was created in response to a few picky veggie eaters in my household who love corn casserole, but aren't fond of some garden favorites. This gets gobbled up every time! No one ever guesses at the amount of veggies inside this firm but creamy yumminess! This great potluck pleaser freezes well. I used freshly chopped squash and zucchini as well as frozen chopped veggies (originally from my garden).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir yellow summer squash, zucchini, and red onion in hot oil until softened, about 10 minutes; season with garlic powder and black pepper. Stir Parmesan cheese into the squash mixture. Turn off the heat and add margarine and cream cheese, breaking them into smaller pieces as you stir them into the squash mixture; remove the saucepan from heat. Stir kernel corn and 1 can cream-style corn through the squash mixture.\nStir remaining can of cream-style corn, dry corn muffin mix, eggs, and sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly mixed. Add the cooled squash mixture, 1 to 2 cups at a time, until completely integrated; pour into prepared baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until browned and bubbling on the edges and firm on top, 30 to 50 minutes. Allow to cool at least 5 minutes before serving.",
