After many attempts (10 full batches, to be exact) at adjusting my recipe, this is what my taste buds came up with. I hope you will give it a try and enjoy it as much as my family and I do. For the ultimate pizza experience use Brothers\u00c2\u00ae pepperoni and Mozzarellissima\u00c2\u00ae pizza cheese.\"",
