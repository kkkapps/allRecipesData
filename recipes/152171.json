    "des": "\"This is a different type of coleslaw made with lots of bacon! My husband and I went up to the northern shore of Lake Superior to get away for a few days. He was grilling. I was making some side dishes. We really wanted a salad, so I made this with the ingredients we had. We both loved it! Sometimes I use white vinegar, but my husband prefers the red wine vinegar.\"",
    "ins": "Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp; drain, crumble, and set aside.\nMake the dressing by whisking together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, and celery seed in a small bowl.\nToss together the coleslaw mix and green onion in a large bowl; add the dressing and toss to coat; stir in the bacon. Serve immediately.",
