    "des": "\"This is the easiest party recipe idea! I came up with this for the Big Game 2 years ago. It is a party hit! Everyone loved it! And it's hassle-free! You can alter this recipe by adding virtually anything you enjoy, such as jalapenos, corn, pinto beans, etc. For vegetarians, eliminate the meat and you're set!\"",
