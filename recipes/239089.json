    "ins": "Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour quick oats over butter; cook and stir until oats are warmed, about 30 seconds. Drizzle maple syrup and corn syrup over the oats and stir to coat. Sprinkle brown sugar over the oats and immediately remove skillet from heat; stir mixture until the sugar melts and the oats are coated, 1 to 2 minutes.\nPour the oats mixture into a bowl; add chocolate chips, almond extract, and vanilla extract. Gently stir the mixture to distribute chocolate chips throughout the oats mixture; spread onto a flat, shallow pan to cool completely.\nDivide peach slices between 2 bowls. Sprinkle oats mixture over the peaches.",
