    "des": "\"This hearty dish is a great make-ahead option (thank you, slow cooker!) for your next family gathering or tailgate party. You can adjust the sweet and spicy flavors as desired. The slaw can be part of the sandwich or served on the side - or both. Pair it with potato salad, baked beans or mac 'n cheese.\"",
    "ins": "To make rub, combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Mix well with a fork. Reserve 1/4 cup of the rub to use in the barbecue sauce.\nTo make sauce, combine all ingredients in a large Mason jar, stirring well. Cover with tight-fitting lid and give it one more good shake. Place in refrigerator overnight.\nPlace pork rub in a large casserole dish.\nUsing a fork, pierce the pork several times all over.\nRub the spice blend into the pork, covering all surfaces.\nWrap rubbed pork tightly in plastic and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.\nAt cooking time, unwrap the pork and place in a slow-cooker.\nPour 1 cup of the Barbecue Sauce on the pork, covering all surfaces.\nCover and cook until tender, 9 to 11 hours on Low or 5 to 7 hours on High.\nTransfer pork to a large, deep, wide casserole dish and cool for 15 to 20 minutes.\nUsing two large forks, shred the pork into bite-size pieces, discarding excess fat. Cover to keep warm.\nSkim any fat from the liquid in the pot. Transfer 2 to 3 tablespoons to a bowl and stir in the remaining barbecue sauce.\nStir well and add more of the braising liquid if you prefer a thinner sauce.\nWarm buns in the oven at 400 degrees, turning over once, just until slightly toasty.\nPile pulled pork onto buns, top with some of the Barbecue Sauce and some Tangy Slaw (recipe below) and enjoy.\nFor the slaw: In a large bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, brown sugar, garlic, salt and pepper.\nAdd cabbage, carrots, cucumber and parsley, mixing well.\nAllow to sit, loosely covered with plastic, for about 30 minutes.\nToss once before serving, adjusting seasonings, if desired.",
