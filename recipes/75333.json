    "des": "\"For people who like chicken and are looking for something a little different, this recipe is for you. Brown sugar, soy sauce, and cocoa provide the base for this rather colorful dish. Goes well on a bed of fried rice. Refried beans make a good side dish. Substitute your favorite vegetables for tomatoes and Cheddar cheese for the Swiss (or Gouda if you can afford it).\"",
    "ins": "In a bowl, mix the brown sugar and soy sauce. Stir in the cocoa, cilantro, sage, and almonds. Set aside.\nIn a separate bowl, toss together the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese.\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in the skillet, and cook 15 minutes, until juices run clear. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the brown sugar and soy sauce mixture until heated through. Top with the peppers, tomatoes, and cheese to serve.",
