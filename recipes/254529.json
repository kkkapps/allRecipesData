    "ins": "Place the bitter melon and salt into a bowl; toss until melon is covered. Let sit until bitterness is extracted, about 40 minutes. Rinse melon under cold running water. Run the melon through a juicer to collect 1/2 to 1 fluid ounce of juice.\nCombine the melon juice and lime-flavored gelatin mix in a glass bowl. Pour in hot water; stir until gelatin is dissolved. Allow to cool, 3 to 5 minutes. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.\nCombine 2 1/2 cups of water and pearl sago in a pot; bring to boil. Cook until sago becomes translucent, about 10 minutes. Strain the sago through a sieve. Place sago in a bowl; add condensed milk. Mix together until the milk coats the sago, stirring continuously so that they mixture does not clump. Top the chilled jelly with sago mixture.",
