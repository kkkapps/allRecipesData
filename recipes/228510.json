    "des": "\"Traditional morning glory muffin recipe, tweaked to make it heartier and tastier. Half the fat, less sugar, whole wheat flour, and ground flax seed improve the muffin without anyone in my family knowing the difference. Oh, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Even the kids love these!\"",

Grease 12 large muffin cups.\nMix brown sugar, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cranberries, coconut, flax seed, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
