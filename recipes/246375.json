    "des": "\"Make this easy delicious summer ice cream cake a day ahead to allow time for the whole thing to freeze adequately. This is a delicious cake that I make for my husband. He prefers brownies to cake and he just loves ice cream. I added the Reese's\u00c2\u00ae Peanut Butter Cups because the grand kids and their nanny love them too! It is a great all-in-one cake and ice cream cake. I hope you enjoy it!\"",
