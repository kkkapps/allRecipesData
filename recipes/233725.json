Not only is this pretty, but it's versatile and delicious on so many things, from something as simple as tortilla chips to fancier things like seared prawns. You can't beat this sweet heat on spicy meat!\"",
    "ins": "Peel mango using a vegetable peeler. Continue to use the peeler on the flesh of the mango down to the pit, creating thin slices of mango. Stack the mango strips and slice into thin strips; cut crosswise to make very finely diced mango. Transfer mango to a small bowl.\nStir cilantro, Asian chile pepper sauce, rice vinegar, and salt into mango.",
