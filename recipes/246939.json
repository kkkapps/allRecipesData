    "des": "\"Created this in a dorm room when all the mug cake recipes I found were terrible. It's super easy to make and to memorize, and if you only use one mug, a tablespoon measure, and a spoon, you have a lot fewer dishes to do. Easy to make in under 5 minutes with minimal mess, so enjoy! And never feel bad about eating the entire thing yourself.\"",
    "ins": "Microwave chocolate chips and butter in a microwave-safe mug until melted, about 20 seconds. Add brown sugar, white sugar, salt, baking soda, and vanilla extract; mix together until combined. Stir in egg yolk. Add flour; mix until batter is blended and smooth.\nCook in the microwave until crust forms but center is still fudgy, about 35 seconds. Add 5 to 10 seconds for a drier consistency.",
