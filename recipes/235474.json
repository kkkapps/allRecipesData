    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan.\nBeat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, blending the first into the brown sugar mixture before adding the other.\nSift flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Stir about half the flour mixture into the brown sugar mixture. Pour pineapple with its juice into the brown sugar mixture and stir; add remaining flour mixture and stir just until a batter forms. Fold pecans and raisins into the batter; pour into prepared loaf pan.\nMix white sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over the batter in the loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
