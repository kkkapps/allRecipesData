    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place one pie crust on the bottom of a pie plate.\nToss peach slices and blueberries in a large bowl with lemon juice. Combine sugar, tapioca, and salt in a small bowl; pour over peach mixture and toss to coat. Transfer to prepared pie plate and scatter butter pieces over fruit. Cover pie with remaining crust; press and seal the top and bottom crusts.\nCut several slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape, then brush with egg yolk.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes.",
