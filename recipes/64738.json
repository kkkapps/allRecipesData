    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nTear the ham and salami into small pieces and place in a medium bowl. Stir in the ricotta cheese, egg and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Press one pie crust into a 9 inch pie plate and fill with the meat mixture. Cover with the other pie crust and press the edges together to seal. Cut a few slits in the top to vent steam.\nBake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is golden brown and filling is set. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until cold before serving.",
