    "des": "\"This recipe was created to encourage my picky kids to eat the squash that we had in abundance. These turned out so good they like them better than the 'normal' cinnamon rolls. You can use any type of squash including butternut, acorn, hubbard, or even pumpkin. This recipe is a modified version of Winter Squash Rolls and Clone of a Cinnabon\u00c2\u00ae.\"",
    "ins": "Put squash in a saucepan and pour in enough water to cover; bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain water from saucepan, cool squash, and mash using a potato masher or fork.\nPour warm water into a bowl and sprinkle in yeast. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.\nCombine flour, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Stir yeast mixture, mashed squash, milk, and 1/2 cup butter into flour mixture until dough starts to hold together. Turn dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth.\nPlace dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat all sides. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nRoll dough into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread 1/3 cup butter over the top of dough. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl and sprinkle over butter layer. Roll dough around filling and cut into 12 to 15 rolls. Place rolls in the prepared baking dish and let rise until nearly doubled in size, about 30 minutes.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.\nBeat confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup butter, cream cheese, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until frosting is smooth; spread onto warm rolls.",
