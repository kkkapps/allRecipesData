    "des": "\"This recipe makes the best turkey ever. It's great for Thanksgiving, potlucks, or dinner parties. Its can be made a day in advance to save time.  It's a wonderful dish with just the right amount of spice that will fill your whole neighborhood with an enchanting aroma.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nStir together the onion, roasted red peppers, whiskey, and garlic and place this mixture inside the cavity of the bird. Mince chipotle peppers in a food processor until about the consistency of spaghetti sauce. Rub half of the chipotles on the outside of the turkey, and place the rest inside the bird cavity. Place turkey in a roasting bag; close the bag according to the bag directions, and place onto a roasting pan.\nBake the turkey in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 3 1/2 hours.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the turkey from the oven, and allow to rest in a warm area  10 to 15 minutes before slicing.",
