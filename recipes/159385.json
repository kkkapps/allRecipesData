Stir in the Italian seasoning, onion, garlic, and mushrooms; cook and stir until the mushrooms have softened and the onion has turned translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the water and spinach, and cover; cook a few minutes until the spinach has wilted.\nPlace the pizza crust on a pizza pan, and spread with sauce; top with the chicken and spinach mixture. Arrange the tomato slices over the pizza, then sprinkle with Gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses.\nBake in preheated oven until the cheese has melted and lightly toasted, 10 to 15 minutes.",
