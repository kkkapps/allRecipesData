    "des": "\"This is a recipe that I made up. It came out great and delicious. This recipe is very creamy, so if you like a less creamy ice cream you can play around with the milk and cream to get the desired texture you like. If you like a harder ice cream, place it in the freezer for a few hours. This is a perfect Thanksgiving recipe. It's very decadent.\"",
    "ins": "Stir milk, sugar, pumpkin spice, and salt together in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.\nWhisk egg yolks in a small bowl. Slowly pour 1/2 cup of hot milk mixture into egg yolks while continuously whisking.\nPour yolk mixture into simmering milk mixture and cook and stir until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes; remove from heat, add white chocolate and stir until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth.\nPlace mixture in refrigerator until cold, about 2 hours. Stir heavy cream and vanilla extract into chilled mixture until smooth; pour into ice cream maker's container and freeze according to manufacturer's directions.",
