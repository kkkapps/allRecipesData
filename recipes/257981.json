Cover pans with aluminum foil and place in a baking pan. Pour enough water into the baking pan to come up halfway up the sides.\nBake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until cooked through, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
