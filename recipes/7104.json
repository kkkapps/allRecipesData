    "ins": "Stir yeast and sugar, gradually adding warm water. Add about half the flour and the salt and beat well. Add the remainder of the flour gradually to acquire a stiff dough. It may require more or less than 7 cups.\nKnead 5 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.\nPut dough into a buttered bowl and turn once to butter surface. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled, keeping it between 80 and 90 degrees F during the entire time of rising, about 2 hours.\nPunch down dough with your fist and divide into two parts. Knead and shape into 2 loaves and place into loaf pans. Cover again and allow dough to rise to top of pans.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes.",
