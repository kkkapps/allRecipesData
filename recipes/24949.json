    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, cocoa and flour.  Stir in water, a little at a time, to make a smooth paste.  Stir in milk and butter.  Bring to a boil over medium heat and let boil 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.  Let cool completely at room temperature, stirring often to prevent a skin from forming.  Store in refrigerator after cooling.",
