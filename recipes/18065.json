    "ins": "Stir the beans and salsa together in a small bowl until smooth. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour beaten eggs into pan and allow bottom to set, approximately 1 minute. Spread bean mixture onto one half of eggs and flip other half over to make a half-circle. Continue to cook until eggs are set.\nSpread an equal amount of mayonnaise onto each tortilla. Cut eggs into 4 equal pieces and place one piece on each tortilla. Cover each with shredded lettuce. Roll up tortillas and serve.",
