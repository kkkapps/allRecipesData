    "des": "\"This salad is a combination of a fruit dip recipe I learned last week and an apple salad I saw in the grocery store. It was enough inspiration to come up with this delicious recipe for our cook-out this afternoon! I have two boys and a daycare and would recommend this recipe as super-simple to make with kids. Children love chopping apples (even littles can do this with a butter knife) and mixing the dressing. I used \u00c2\u00be of my dressing and reserved the rest to use as fruit dip later.\"",
    "ins": "Toss diced apples with lemon juice in a salad bowl.\nBeat Neufchatel cheese, whipped cream, brown sugar, mayonnaise, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy.\nStir grapes and celery into apples and toss lightly with dressing to coat. Top salad with walnut halves and sweetened dried cranberries.",
