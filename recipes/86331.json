    "des": "\"This salad has become a staple of my kitchen. I like that it is a chopped salad, a technique that virtually ensures each bite will include every ingredient. There is something magical about the pine nut and Parmesan combination, a fact that will not be lost on pesto lovers. This is one of those rare recipes that justifies the expense of imported Parmigiano-Reggiano.\"",
    "ins": "For the vinaigrette: Whisk together the mustard, red wine vinegar and chopped oregano in a small bowl. Whisk in the olive oil until the consistency is smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.\nToss together the radicchio, Belgian endive, arugula, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and pine nuts in a large salad bowl. Pour the vinaigrette over the salad ingredients and toss lightly to coat. Divide onto four chilled salad plates and serve.",
