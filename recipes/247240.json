    "des": "\"Tangy buttermilk, sweet corn, and spices combine to make a simple, yet rich soup. If you don't have buttermilk, you can make some by adding a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice or white vinegar to a cup of milk and letting it stand for 1/2 hour.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook garlic, white parts of onions, coriander, cumin, and chile powder, stirring, until garlic and onions are tender, about 3 minutes. Add corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes.\nTransfer mixture to a blender. Add buttermilk, water, and salt and puree until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids. Chill at least 1 hour.\nServe chilled, garnished with green parts of onions and cilantro (if using).",
