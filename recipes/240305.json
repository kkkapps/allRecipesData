    "ins": "Sprinkle salt over entire roast and wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate, 4 hours to 24 hours.\nCombine olive oil, black pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Set aside for flavors to blend, at least 1 hour.\nPour most of the oil mixture over the roast and massage into the top and sides of meat. Flip the roast and pour remaining oil mixture over roast and massage. Place roast on a plate and refrigerate, 1 hour to 12 hours.\nPreheat smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) to 230 degrees F (107 degrees C). Add hickory or pecan wood chips to smoker.\nInsert an oven-safe meat thermometer into the thickest part of roast. Place roast into the smoker and roast until internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 3 to 3 1/2 hours.\nPreheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C).\nBake the roast in the preheated oven until crust is crunchy, produced a reverse sear, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow roast to rest 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.",
