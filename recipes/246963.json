    "des": "\"Just made this cake on the fly because I was supposed to make pancakes but we went out for breakfast and I already had a bowl with some flours mixed together. It is the best gluten-free carob cake I have ever made. It's somewhere between super-moist awesome cake and banana bread. Serve with your fave ice cream or fruit. It can even be a sweet treat for breakfast if you wish. Hope you try it out.\"",

Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.\nCombine brown rice flour, almond flour, milk, carob powder, honey, vegetable oil, banana, eggs, vanilla extract, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; whisk together until well-mixed. Pour into prepared cake pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. If the middle is not baked through, lower the oven temperature to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C) and continue baking, about 10 minutes more.",
