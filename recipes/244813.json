Pour 1/4 cup of the prepared sauce onto chicken chunks; mix until all chicken pieces are coated. Set aside 15 minutes.\nHeat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. As soon as oil starts to smoke, place chicken chunks in a single layer in the pan. Cook and stir until chicken pieces start to caramelize and turn deep brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in sliced jalapeno and red peppers, peanuts, and green onions. Cook and stir one minute. Pour in remainder of sauce. Simmer until heated through, 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from heat.\nStir in cilantro. Serve over hot cooked rice and top with chopped green onions.",
