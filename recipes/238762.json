    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange bacon in a Reynolds(R) Bakeware Bacon Pan.\nBake for 8 minutes, until almost crisp. Drizzle the bacon with 1 tablespoon maple syrup and bake 4 to 6 minutes more or until glazed. Cook longer for crispier bacon. Cool and chop.\nStir together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, butter and remaining 4 tablespoons maple syrup. Add the milk mixture all at once to the cornmeal mixture. Add the chopped bacon. Stir just until moistened. Pour the batter into an 8x8-inch Reynolds(R) Bakeware Pan.\nBake 20 to 25 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Let cool slightly before serving.\nDrizzle with additional maple syrup, if desired.",
