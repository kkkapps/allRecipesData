    "des": "\"The ingredients in this easy wrap can be altered to your personal preference. Use your grill to make this into an easy summertime treat. In the winter, your oven will work just fine. The finished product will taste like something you'd order at a full service restaurant... but you'll be enjoying it in your own home!\"",
