    "des": "\"These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had! Very buttery and very hearty. Any dried fruit works well such as cherries, raisins, cranberries, blueberries, or chopped apricots. For a really decadent treat, use chocolate chips and nuts instead of fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C)\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg,  then stir in the vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg, gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the quick oats and dried fruit. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the unprepared cookie sheet.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
