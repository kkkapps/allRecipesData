    "des": "\"I went to a restaurant and spent an arm and a leg to try this appetizer. Once it came out, I was dumbfounded on how easy it would be to make. So I made it and even tweaked it a little and everybody loves it. Serve with tortilla chips such as Tostitos\u00c2\u00ae Scoops!\u00c2\u00ae. I have used different kinds of pico de gallo ranging from the mango to chipotle. To prevent your avocado from browning, chop it up and mix in right before serving.\"",
