    "des": "\"This is a frosting I normally put on birthday cakes.  Its like the frosting that bakeries put on cakes, but I much prefer to make my own since I know what I am putting into it, and as always, homemade is best.  This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.\"",
    "ins": "Cream butter until soft.  Add salt and part of sugar gradually, blending after each addition.  Then add egg yolks and vanilla; blend well.  Add remaining sugar, alternately with milk, until of right consistency to spread, beating after each addition until smooth.  Makes 2 1/2 cups or enough frosting to cover tops and sides of two 8 or 9 inch layers.\nNote:  If desired, 1 whole egg may be substituted for the 2 egg yolks to make 2 3/4 cups frosting.",
