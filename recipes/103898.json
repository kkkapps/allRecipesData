    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat.  Cook the leek and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the rice, and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.\nPour in 1 1/2 cups of the chicken broth, and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes, continuing to stir.  Pour in the remaining chicken broth and wine, increase heat to medium, and cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly.\nAdd the scallops, shrimp, peas, and red pepper.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the remaining liquid is almost absorbed, and the seafood has cooked, about 5 minutes.  When the rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, and pepper.",
