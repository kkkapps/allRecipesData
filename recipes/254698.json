    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nHeat oil in a 10-inch ovenproof skillet (with lid) over medium heat. Cook green onions, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add 1 package spinach and 2 tablespoons water and cook, covered, until wilted, about 1 minute. Stir spinach with tongs, then add remaining package spinach and remaining tablespoon water. Cook, covered, stirring once or twice, until tender, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.\nMeanwhile, bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil. Break each ramen noodle block into 4 pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, about 3 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander and rinse under cold water. Toss noodles with spinach mixture in skillet and spread mixture evenly over bottom of pan.\nBlend eggs, spreadable cheese, and salt in a blender until smooth. Pour egg mixture evenly over spinach mixture. Stir spinach mixture gently with a fork to allow egg mixture to flow underneath. Sprinkle top with Parmesan cheese.\nTransfer skillet to oven and bake until puffed slightly and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cut into 4 wedges and serve from skillet.",
