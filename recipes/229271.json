Remove to a plate, reserving the grease in the pan.\nPlace ham slices in the pan and cook over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes on each side. Season both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Remove ham and reserve on a plate.\nReduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle flour over the pan drippings. Cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Increase heat to medium-high and pour in coffee into the pan. Cook and stir until combined and thickened. Season to taste. Return ham to the pan to warm through.",
