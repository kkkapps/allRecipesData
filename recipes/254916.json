    "des": "\"I was itching to do a recipe with mushrooms and goat cheese, and this is what I came up with. It works as an entree or a side dish, and can be served alongside other grilled recipes. Using an outdoor grill will shorten the total prep time.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nPour marinade into a shallow bowl. Add zucchini, gold zucchini, and mushrooms. Let marinate, flipping occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes.\nGrill zucchini and gold zucchini, turning occasionally and brushing with marinade, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat with mushrooms. Transfer to a serving plate.\nPlace pine nuts in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Toast, tossing occasionally, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nHeat oil in a large oven-safe skillet. Add shallot; cook and stir until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and basil; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add grilled zucchini, gold zucchini, and mushrooms. Coat with goat cheese.\nTransfer skillet to the preheated oven; broil, keeping oven door open, until goat cheese is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.\nSprinkle toasted pine nuts and chives over goat cheese.",
