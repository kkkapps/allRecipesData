    "des": "\"I made this rub for my daughters 14th birthday, which is why I called it BBQ dry rub No.14. It gives pork a nice sweet flavor that goes well with all the other spices. This rub has a mild flavor and will not burn sensitive pallets. The light brown sugar gives a gentle sweetness to offset the other spices and is great on ribs or pork shoulder. For ribs sprinkle salt and pepper and refrigerate overnight. Larger cuts of meat can use more. For heat lovers, add 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (or any amount you like).\"",
