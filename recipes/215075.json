    "des": "\"This is a traditional breakfast served in many Arabic countries. It can also be eaten for lunch or dinner in case you don't have any meat on hand, as the beans are full of protein and fiber! Very delicious! Serve and eat the traditional way, by grabbing it with pita bread.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the jalapeno pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 5 more minutes. Mix in tomato and tomato paste; stir to combine with the onion and jalapeno pepper. Pour in the kidney beans with their liquid; stir in the cumin and curry powder. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the beans are hot and the sauce has thickened, about 15 minutes.",
