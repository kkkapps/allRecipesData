    "des": "\"An original Portuguese recipe with pork and clams.\"",
    "ins": "In large bowl, combine wine, paprika, salt and pepper, blend well.  Add garlic cloves, bay leaf, and cubed meat, turn meat in marinade to coat pieces. Marinate for 6 hours, turning occasionally.\nDrain pork; reserve marinade. Pat cubes completely dry.  Discard garlic and bay leaf.  Melt 1 teaspoon of oil in large skillet.  Add pork cubes, stirring frequently so that the meat colors quickly and evenly.  Transfer with slotted spoon to a bowl.\nPour reserved marinade into skillet and bring to a boil over high heat, scraping off any brown particles clinging to the inside of pan. Boil briskly uncovered until marinade is reduced to 1 cup. Pour over pork and set aside.\nIn 6 to 8 quart pan, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil; add onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently until onion is soft but not brown.  Add garlic, tomatoes and crushed red pepper. Simmer, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.\nSpread the clams, hinged side down, over the tomato sauce; cover the pan tightly and cook over medium to high heat for ten minutes or until clams open.  Stir in reserved pork and juices.  Simmer for 5 minutes to heat thoroughly.  Sprinkle with parsley.",
