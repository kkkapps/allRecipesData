    "des": "\"This is one of our favorite dishes during Lent. This recipe can be made ahead and then kept warm in the oven for 20 minutes. Being Irish and German, I make potato pancakes both ways. Serve with sour cream, applesauce, and/or ranch dressing. The kids love the ranch dressing.\"",
    "ins": "Stir mashed potatoes, flour, milk, egg, butter, and sea salt together in a bowl. Add shredded potatoes, Cheddar cheese, and zucchini; stir until batter is well-combined.\nHeat 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, drop batter by heaping tablespoons into hot oil. Cook, turning once, until golden-brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining oil and batter.",
