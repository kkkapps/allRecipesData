    "des": "\"L'il Woody's executive chef Cory Alfano said he was inspired by the fresh flavors of summer when he created this burger served as a weekly special at the beloved Seattle restaurant: Imagine a nice summer Pacific Northwest day and wanting to grill some burgers with friends. Super easy, just go down to your local farmers market and pick up some fresh ingredients from local purveyors to make an amazingly light but meaty late-afternoon grilled burger. Heirloom tomatoes, arugula, red onions, local cheese, and grass-fed beef make this 'Farmers Market Burger' a sure thing.\"",
    "ins": "Combine sea salt, porcini mushrooms, thyme, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and red pepper flakes in a food processor; blend until thoroughly mixed. Pour seasoning mixture into a bowl.\nCombine egg yolks, lemon juice, garlic, and dill in the food processor; blend, pouring in canola oil and olive oil in a steady stream until aioli is thick and smooth.\nCombine sliced onions, red wine vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper in an airtight container. Let marinate, at least 15 minutes.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nSpread buns on grill and toast until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a serving platter. Spread some aioli over each half.\nShape ground beef into 6 large patties. Sprinkle seasoning mixture generously over both sides.\nIncrease grill heat to high. Grill patties until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 4 minutes per side.\nPlace 1 cooked patty on the bottom of each toasted bun. Top each with 3 tablespoons goat cheese, 2 tomato slices, 1 heaping tablespoon pickled red onions, and 1/2 cup arugula. Cover with top half of the bun.",
