    "des": "\"A very delicious goose dish. Good with tame and wild goose meat, as it will remove the wild-game taste. Great recipe that can cook all day while you're at work. When finished it makes an excellent gravy that is great with mashed potatoes. Also, my wife and kids couldn't stand the taste of goose until I made this recipe, now they love it.\"",
