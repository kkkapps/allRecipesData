    "des": "\"This bread machine recipe turns out a perfectly textured flavorful bread every time. I prefer to let the bread machine cycle thru 2nd rise, then shape the loaf and bake in the oven at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes. The dill cheese combination is great toasted and makes wonderful salad croutons.\"",
    "ins": "Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select the white bread light crust setting; press Start.  If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the Cheddar and Asiago cheeses at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.",
