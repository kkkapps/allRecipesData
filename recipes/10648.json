These make wonderful gifts to give any time of year and also for wedding favors, hostess gifts, baby showers or take to a cookie exchange and make sure to bake some up so people know what they taste like to.  Store in a cool dry place away from a heat source so condensation and clumping does not occur. Enjoy!\"",
