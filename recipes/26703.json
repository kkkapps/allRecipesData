    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nCut each slice of white bread in half horizontally. Spread with cream cheese. Tightly roll each piece of bread with half a piece of bacon. The bacon should be on the outside of the bread. Secure with toothpicks.\nArrange roll ups in a single layer on a medium baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until bacon is no longer pink and bread is lightly browned. Serve warm.",
