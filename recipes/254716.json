    "des": "\"This is a delicious fusion recipe my husband and I discovered. It's a blend of American hot wing flavors with Brazilian stroganoff flavors. We serve ours Brazilian-style over savory rice (cooked with chicken stock, onions, and garlic) with crushed potato chips on top, but the sauce is also good with noodles, tortilla chips, potatoes, or any carbohydrate.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add chicken breasts; cook until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Stir in mayonnaise, milk, hot pepper sauce, mustard, and ranch dressing mix. Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes.\nStir sour cream and Parmesan cheese into the saucepan; bring to a simmer. Stir in heavy cream until sauce thickens to the consistency of gravy. Remove from heat; let stand before serving, about 5 minutes.",
