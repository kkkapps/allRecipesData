Place a lid on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until couscous is tender and the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Transfer couscous to a bowl.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat. Cook red bell pepper and yellow bell pepper strips in the hot skillet until soft and slightly charred, about 5 minutes; add to couscous and stir.\nWhisk olive oil and lemon juice together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle oil mixture over the couscous mixture and stir to coat. Gently stir tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese through the couscous.",
