    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.\nCook and stir garlic and green onions in saucepan until garlic is just golden, about 3 minutes.\nCook and stir asparagus with garlic and green onions until slightly softened, about  2 more minutes.\nPour in vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until asparagus is tender, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool slightly.\nPour soup into blender, filling no more than halfway full. Cover with a lid. Carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth.\nTransfer soup back to saucepan and reheat.  Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste.",
