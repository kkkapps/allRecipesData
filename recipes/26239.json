    "des": "\"These cookies are so good that we have to literally make a bushel of them. They eat like potato chips because they are paper thin. They are definitely worth the extra effort. Have help and make an afternoon of delicious fun. We use a pasta machine on the smallest setting for rolling strips of dough.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, whisk together eggs, vanilla and melted butter until well blended. Mix in the salt and baking powder. Gradually stir in flour with a wooden spoon until dough is stiff. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead in as much flour as necessary to make a smooth stiff dough. Dough should not be sticky. Roll the dough out paper thin and cut into 3 inch squares.\nFry in the hot oil, turning once until golden. Drain in colander and place them into a waxed paper lined bushel basket.  Dust with confectioners' sugar when cool.",
