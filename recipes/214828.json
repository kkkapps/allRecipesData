Place the steak in slow cooker, sprinkle with onions, and pour the ketchup mixture over the steak.\nTurn the slow cooker to High and cook for 1 hour. Reduce the heat to Low and continue cooking until the meat is tender, about 4 hours. Serve on hoagie buns and top with 1/4 cup coleslaw, if desired, for a Southern BBQ flavor.",
