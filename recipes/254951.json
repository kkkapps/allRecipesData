    "des": "\"This is a simple yet comforting muffin. Tastes more like a spice cake that will stay moist for days. I make this all throughout the fall when kabocha squash is in season.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease lightly with cooking spray.\nPlace kabocha squash skin-side down on the baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven until fork-tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Scoop squash flesh into a food processor; puree until smooth. Discard skin.\nReduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin tins with cooking spray.\nStir white sugar, brown sugar, canola oil, and olive oil in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Stir in 3/4 cup pureed squash and vanilla extract.\nMix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Stir gradually into the sugar mixture, alternating with apple cider, until smooth. Pour into muffin tins, filling each cup 3/4 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes.",
