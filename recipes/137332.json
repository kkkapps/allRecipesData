    "ins": "Combine the milk and cream in a saucepan, and whisk over high heat until hot and frothy. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and sugar. Whisk together hot espresso and white chocolate chips in a mug until smooth. If you are making two, pour half into another mug. Top with the frothy hot milk and stir to blend in the flavoring.",
