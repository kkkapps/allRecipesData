    "des": "\"Not happy with any at-home recipes for nacho sauce, I made up my own! A thick, creamy nacho cheese sauce that you will swear came out of a jar. Cheesy, subtly spicy, and bursting with nacho flavor--it rivals any store-bought nacho cheese sauce. Just be sure to save some aside for yourself! Serve warm immediately over or with tortilla chips, on tacos or burritos, or as any other dip.\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour to form a thick paste. Whisk in 3/4 cup milk; cook and stir until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.\nStir Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream into milk mixture until smooth, about 1 minute. Add remaining milk, diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and paprika; cook and stir until thickened to sauce consistency, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.",
