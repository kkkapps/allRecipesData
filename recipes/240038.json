    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nPut chia seeds in a blender; add hot water. Let chia seeds soak in hot water for 5 minutes. Add sugar, olive oil, coffee-flavored liqueur, water, agave nectar, lecithin, almond extract, vanilla extract, and salt to chia seeds; blend on high speed until smooth.\nCombine flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder in a bowl. Gradually stir the chia seed mixture into the flour mixture until dough is just mixed; fold in chocolate chips, pecans, and cocoa nibs.\nDivide dough in half and spoon each half onto the prepared baking sheets forming two 2x12-inch logs using wet hands.\nBake in the preheated oven until logs are lightly browned, about 40 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and cool logs for 10 minutes.\nReduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nCut logs diagonally into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Lay slices on their sides on the parchment-lined baking sheets.\nBake in the oven until biscotti are dry, about 25 minutes.",
