Whisk together the rice flour, sugar and baking powder; set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the water, vanilla, coconut milk and red food coloring. Blend in the rice flour mixture. Pour into the prepared pan.\nCover the pan with foil and bake for 1 hour. Allow to cool completely.\nTurn the pan of mochi out onto a clean surface that has been dusted with potato starch. Cut into bite size pieces using a plastic knife. The mochi does not stick as much to plastic knives.",
