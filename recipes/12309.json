    "ins": "Wash and hull strawberries; slice into quarters. Place half the strawberries in a saucepan. Whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt. Toss strawberries with sugar mixture and add 1/2 cup water. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.\nCombine 1/4 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar in a saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves; you may stir until the mixture starts to boil, but don't stir once it's boiling (see Editor's Note). Boil, uncovered, until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage: 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), or until a small amount of mixture forms a soft ball when placed in cold water.\nMeanwhile, combine egg whites, cream of tartar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix on medium speed until medium-stiff peaks form.\nWhen the sugar syrup reaches 240 degrees, remove it from the heat. With the mixer running on high speed, carefully pour the hot syrup in a steady stream between the beater and the side of the mixing bowl. Beat meringue mixture until cool. Stir in almond extract.\nMix the cooled cooked strawberries with the remaining fresh strawberries; pour into pie shell. Spoon meringue over strawberries. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.",
