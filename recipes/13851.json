    "des": "\"This is my recipe for a very tasty and unique cranberry sauce.  It was this recipe that converted my 'we only want the jellied sauce in can' family into homemade cranberry sauce lovers. This sauce is best if made a day ahead and can be served either warm or cold.  (I prefer warm, but my family is partial to cold).\"",
    "ins": "Wash and pick over cranberries. Place in a medium saucepan with water, and sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, stir and simmer for 10 minutes or until cranberries burst.\nSlightly mash the cranberries with the back of a wooden spoon to insure all skins are broken. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Mix well.\nRemove from heat and mix in the blueberries (don't be afraid to break a few, but don't over mash either). The sauce will thicken as it cools.\nTransfer to a bowl, cool slightly and place plastic wrap directly on top of sauce to cover. Refrigerate until chilled.",
