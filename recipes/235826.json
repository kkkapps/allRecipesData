    "des": "\"This is the easiest turkey recipe I have ever come across. The moist meat falls right off the bone. No slicing involved.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).\nSeason turkey with salt and pepper and place, breast-side down, in a roaster; add neck and giblets. Pour water into pan.\nBake in the preheated oven, basting as needed, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Continue to roast until meat falls off the bone if desired.",
