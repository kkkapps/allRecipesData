Butter a large casserole dish.\nMix the noodles, cottage cheese, sour cream, onion, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds, and salt together in a large bowl. Spread mixture in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and paprika on top.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.",
