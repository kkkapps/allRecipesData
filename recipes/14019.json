Drain any liquid from the eggplants and mash.\nCombine cheese, bread crumbs, eggs, parsley, onion, garlic and salt with the mashed eggplant. Mix well.\nShape the eggplant mixture into patties. Heat oil in a large skillet. Drop eggplant patties one at a time into skillet. Fry each side of the patties until golden brown, approximately 5 minutes on each side. Patties can be frozen before frying and cooked later.",
