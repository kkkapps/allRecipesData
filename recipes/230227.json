    "des": "\"I got this recipe from an old family friend. She used to make us these pickles when we were kids. It is a really simple recipe, and the hardest part is not eating the pickles before they are ready. You can add pimentos, sliced bell peppers, or whole garlic cloves to the vinegar solution as alternative options.\"",
    "ins": "Stir sugar, salt, and vinegar together in a plastic container with a lid until sugar is mostly dissolved. Place cucumbers and onion in the vinegar solution; stir to coat. Cover container and refrigerate for at least 2 days, stirring occasionally.",
