    "des": "\"A grilled chicken summer favorite! Here, savory GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Mojo Criollo and sweet GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Pineapple Nectar create a marinade for chicken that couldn't be tastier to eat--or easier to make! Simply marinate the chicken, thread on skewers with vegetables, and then grill. Try it tonight, and you'll see why these Tropical Chicken Skewers have become our signature grilled chicken dish this summer!\"",
    "ins": "In large container with lid, or in large zip-top bag, mix together chicken, Mojo, nectar and Adobo until coated; transfer to refrigerator. Marinate chicken at least 2 hrs, or up to 24 hours.\nStrain chicken, discarding marinade. On each skewer, alternately thread pineapple, chicken, onions and peppers.\nPrepare grill to medium-high heat (or heat oil in large grill pan over medium-high heat). Cook skewers, turning once, until chicken turns dark golden brown and cooked through and vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to serving platter; serve warm.",
