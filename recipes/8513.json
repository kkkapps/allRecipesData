    "ins": "In a large, stewing pot, place whole chicken, 1 1/2 cup sherry, stock, garlic, and onions. Simmer for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, place green chilies in a roasting pan, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until skins begin to blacken.  Peel and seed the peppers.\nRemove chicken from pot, and set aside to cool.  Add green chilies and tomatoes to simmering stock.\nWhen chicken is cool enough to touch, remove the meat from the bones.  Return meat to pot.  Also, add 1 cup more sherry, and salt to taste.  Simmer at least 30 minutes more.   Serve with a little shredded cheese on top.",
