    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; reserving 2 tablespoons drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon and set aside.\nCook and stir onion and bell pepper over medium heat in reserved drippings until tender, about 5 minutes; remove with slotted spoon.\nWhisk eggs and milk in a large bowl. Fold hash browns, Cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, dill, onion mixture, and crumbled bacon into egg mixture; transfer to prepared baking dish.\nBake in preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.",
