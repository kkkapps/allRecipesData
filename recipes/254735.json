You can vary this any way you like--try Cointreau\u00c2\u00ae or Drambuie\u00c2\u00ae (my favorite--very grown up!) liqueur, or add a few drops of real vanilla extract or seeds.\"",
    "ins": "Beat cream in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream will form soft mounds. Fold condensed milk and orange liqueur into beaten cream.\nPlace in an ice cream maker and follow manufacturer's instructions for ice cream, 2 to 4 hours.",
