    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over low heat.  Sweat the garlic; when the garlic becomes aromatic, slowly stir in pepper, cumin, curry powder and chili powder.  When spices begin to fry and become fragrant, stir in the bouillon cube and a little water.\nIncrease heat to high and add the rest of the water and the soy sauce.  Just before the mixture comes to a boil, stir in rice.  Bring to a rolling boil; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed.\nRemove from heat and let stand 5 minutes.",
