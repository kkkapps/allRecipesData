    "des": "\"This is my family recipe. It's great for kids, potlucks, and it's really flexible. Hope you all enjoy! I would add 1/2 to 1 cup of water to the chili after all the other ingredients to make it a little more like soup. If your kids absolutely do not like spicy things, you could add sour cream and cheese to it. Serve with corn chips or corn bread.\"",

Stir green bell pepper, onion, seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground annatto seed, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes through the ground beef; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, about 10 minutes.\nPour diced tomatoes, pinto beans, black beans, and red beans into the pot; season with chili seasoning, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground annatto seed, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and garlic.
