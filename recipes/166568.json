While the roast is searing, place the garlic, mustard, avocado, and steak seasoning into a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. Coat the seared roast all over with the avocado mixture.\nRoast in preheated oven until the tenderloin has reached your desired degree of doneness, about 40 minutes for medium.",
