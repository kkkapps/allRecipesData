    "ins": "Stir the tarragon vinegar and water together in a bowl.\nPack each jar with green beans so they stand on end without crowding. Into each jar, place 1 sprig of fresh dill, 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed, 1/4 teaspoon of mustard seed, 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, 8 to 10 whole black peppercorns, and 2 garlic clove halves. Sprinkle a pinch of salt into each jar.\nFill the rest of the space in the jars with the tarragon vinegar-water mixture, place the lids on the jars, and refrigerate overnight.",
