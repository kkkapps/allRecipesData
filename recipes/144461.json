    "des": "\"Tomato juice and mashed potatoes are the key ingredients for these rosy rolls. They are so delicious hot out of the oven with a bit of butter brushed on top.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the tomato juice, water, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, stir until the sugar and salt dissolve, and sprinkle the yeast over the mixture.  Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.\nMix in the eggs, shortening, and mashed potatoes, and beat in the flour to make a soft dough. Knead for about 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic, and place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top of the dough. Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours or overnight.\nLine baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside.\nWorking on a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 4 equal pieces, and cut each into 12 small pieces. Roll the pieces into balls, place the rolls 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets, cover with a towel, and let the rolls rise in a warm place until double, about 2 hours.\nPreheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBake the rolls in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.",
