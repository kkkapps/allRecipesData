    "des": "\"Sugar cookies on a stick! These cookies make great party favors or centerpiece bouquets. Decorate with sprinkles or frosting. You will need two dozen craft sticks for this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, white sugar and brown sugar. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Push craft sticks into the center of each ball. Place balls, with sticks parallel to the cookie sheet, 3 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten them slightly using the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. This is the time to decorate with sprinkles or colored sugar if you desire.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. When cookies are completely cool, wrap in plastic wrap and tie with a pretty ribbon.",
