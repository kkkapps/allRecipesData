    "des": "\"My family calls these \"Italian Cookies\".  They can be made with Anisette or with Anise flavoring.  The orange juice adds nice flavor.  They  are a cake-like cookie that is a Christmas tradition in my family.  (They get huge due to all the baking powder, so do not roll too large).\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, beat eggs. Blend in vegetable oil, orange juice, vanilla, lemon and anise flavoring.\nSift the flour with the sugar and baking powder. Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture. The dough will probably be sticky. Add additional flour until dough no longer sticks to your hands and can rolled.\nPull off a piece of dough about the size of a walnut. Roll it into a rope and shape it into a knot. Place finished knots 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes. Bottoms should slightly brown. Cool cookies on a wire rack. If desired ice with confectioner's sugar icing.",
