    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nBake potatoes in preheated oven for 1 hour.\nMeanwhile,  place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.\nWhen potatoes are done allow them to cool for 10 minutes.  Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.  To the potato flesh add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 the green onions.  Mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.  Spoon the mixture into the potato skins.  Top each with remaining cheese, green onions and bacon.\nBake for another 15 minutes.",
