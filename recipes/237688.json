    "ins": "Mix the olive oil, 4 teaspoons garam masala, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl until combined.

Center one chicken breast half on a sheet of foil;  sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon garam masala on both sides.\nPlace the squash and onion slices on top of the chicken. Drizzle evenly with one-fourth of the olive oil mixture. Bring up foil sides. Double-fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make four packets.\nGrill over medium-high heat in covered grill 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into chicken registers 165 degrees F.\nOpen packets carefully by cutting along top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape; then open top of foil packet. To serve, top with yogurt and sprinkle with cilantro, if desired.",
