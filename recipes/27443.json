In the top of a double boiler, heat chocolate, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.\nIn a large bowl, cream together the butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in melted chocolate and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pans.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. When cool, frost between layers and on top of cake.\nTo make the Frosting:  In a large saucepan, combine evaporated milk, 1 cup sugar, egg yolks, 1/2 cup butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla.
