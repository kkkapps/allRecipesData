    "des": "\"A Mexican favorite, the michelada is a simple way to make a cheap Mexican beer into a delicious drink that will quickly become a party favorite. I recommend a cheap Mexican beer such as Modelo\u00c2\u00ae or Tecate\u00c2\u00ae for best taste and to stay true to the michelada concept.  Best served at a Mexican food barbecue alongside fajitas, Mexican rice, guacamole, salsa, and so on with family and friends!\"",

Pour 1/3 to 1/2 cup michelada mix, or to taste, over the ice. Fill the rest of the glass with beer and stir to serve.",
