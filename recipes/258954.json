Reduce speed to low; slowly add 1/3 of the beaten eggs and mix until well incorporated. Repeat process until all eggs are added. Add sweet potatoes and almond extract; mix until smooth.\nStir flour mixture into butter mixture 1/3 at a time, alternating with milk-juice mixture. Beat on low speed until just incorporated. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes; invert onto rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.",
