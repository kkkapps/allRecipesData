    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil an 8-inch square baking dish.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through but firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes. Drain.\nStir feta cheese, cream cheese, and olive oil together in the empty pot used for orzo until cheeses are mostly melted, placing over low heat if needed. Remove pot from heat. Stir orzo and half-and-half into cheese mixture.\nMix spinach, tuna, dill, salt, and pepper into orzo mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish. Top tuna-orzo mixture with Parmesan cheese. Cover dish tightly with an oven-proof lid or aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove covering and bake until Parmesan cheese is melted and edges are starting to brown, 5 to 8 minutes.",
