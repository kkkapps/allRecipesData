    "des": "\"My dad made these grilled poppers and I begged for the recipe. Now everyone begs me for the recipe. They are stuffed with cream cheese and sausage, wrapped in turkey bacon, and grilled--the perfect balance of flavors, and not always super spicy. The spiciness depends on the peppers. I find that the smaller they are, the hotter they are.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until browned. Drain excess grease, and set aside. Meanwhile, slice the peppers in half lengthwise, and remove and discard the seeds and membrane. Fill one half of each pepper with cream cheese, and the other half with sausage. Put the pepper halves back together, and wrap with a slice of bacon to hold. Secure bacon with a toothpick.\nGrill peppers for about 15 minutes, turning to ensure even cooking until bacon is crisp, and pepper is toasted. Let them cool down a bit, then eat 'em.",
