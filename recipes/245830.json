    "des": "\"This is a wonderful fresh uncooked cranberry salad I've enjoyed since I was a child. It has a dressing made with Miracle Whip\u00c2\u00ae, Cool Whip\u00c2\u00ae, and cream cheese. It sounds kind of strange but it really complements the salad.\"",
    "ins": "Grease a ring mold with 1 tablespoon creamy salad dressing. Zest 1 orange and then peel both oranges.\nPlace oranges, orange zest, cranberries, and apples together in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped. Strain fruit pieces, reserving juice in a quart-size measuring cup. Add enough boiling water to measure 3 cups liquid.\nDissolve unflavored gelatin in cold water in a large bowl. Pour water-juice mixture over unflavored gelatin. Add raspberry gelatin and 2 cups sugar; stir to dissolve completely. Stir in fruit mixture, grapes, and pecans. Pour gelatin mixture into prepared ring mold; chill 8 hours to overnight.\nMix whipped topping, cream cheese, 3 tablespoons creamy salad dressing, and 2 teaspoons sugar together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.\nDip chilled mold in a few inches of hot water to loosen gelatin from mold. Turn out onto a serving platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with dressing.",
