    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a Dutch oven, or deep iron skillet. Dredge steaks in some of the flour, reserving the rest of the flour. Brown steaks in the oil a few at a time, and remove to a plate. When all of the steaks are browned, place a layer of sliced onions into the Dutch oven, and alternate layers of steak and onion. Pour in beef stock and Worcestershire sauce.\nCover, and bake for 2 hours in the preheated oven. Remove steaks and onions from the pan, and whisk in 2 tablespoons of the remaining flour. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook, stirring until thickened. Serve steaks and onions with gravy with mashed potatoes or noodles.",
