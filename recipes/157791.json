    "des": "\"When my doctor said that I needed to eat more vegetables, I decided to make a recipe that was good and had vegetables. I knew that fudge was one of my favorite things to eat and that corn was a vegetable that did not have a lot of flavor. So I mixed those two things together and it was delicious. I could not even tell that I was eating vegetables!\"",
