    "des": "\"It's hard to make slow-cooked food look pretty, and this pork seriously fell apart when I tried to take it out of the slow cooker, so don't judge this by its picture. I promise that this recipe is delicious! My husband even said that this is one of his favorite Sunday dinners. I also made mashed potatoes and the gravy was delicious on them. Use roast between 2 to 3 pounds.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare slow cooker crock with cooking spray. Lay pork roast into crock.\nWhisk Parmesan cheese, honey, soy sauce, basil, garlic, oil, and salt together in a small bowl; pour over the pork roast.\nCook until roast is cooked completely through, 6 to 7 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove roast to a cutting board to rest a few minutes.\nSkim fat from the cooking juices; discard. Ladle remaining juice to a small saucepan; bring to a boil.\nWhisk cornstarch into cold water in a bowl until dissolved; pour into boiling liquid in saucepan. Cook the liquid, stirring frequently, until thickened into a gravy, about 2 minutes.\nSlice pork roast and serve with the gravy.",
