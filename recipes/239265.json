    "des": "\"This recipe is both delicious and healthy, and it's a great way for chocoholics to sneak in their veggies! These cupcakes are very muffin-like, but they are fluffy, chocolaty, and moist. They're a healthy twist to your basic chocolate cupcakes, without sacrificing taste or texture. Enjoy!\"",

Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl; stir into carrot mixture until just combined into a batter. Fold chocolate chips and cranberries into batter. Spoon about 2 tablespoons batter into each prepared muffin cup.\nBake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are fluffy and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.",
