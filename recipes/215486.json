    "des": "\"This is THE BEST lemon zucchini bread I've ever baked or tasted. The recipe came from a friend of my mom's. She kept raving about this bread that she had made while she was visiting. After I made it the first time I can understand why. If I don't put this in the freezer right away, it is gone!!! Butter is really good on this bread if you aren't worried about the calories, fat, etc.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans; sprinkle sugar into the bottom and on the sides of the greased pans.\nBeat the eggs, 2 cups sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and lemon zest together in a large bowl.\nMix the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; add to the egg mixture and stir until the batter is thick. Fold the zucchini into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
