    "ins": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash.\nIn a medium bowl combine 2 cups mashed potatoes with flour and egg.  Using about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of mixture each, shape into dumplings.  Press a crouton into the center of each and seal dough around it.\nDrop dumplings into simmering soup or broth, cover and cook 20 minutes.  Do not remove lid while dumplings are cooking.",
