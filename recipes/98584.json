    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.\nHeat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.",
