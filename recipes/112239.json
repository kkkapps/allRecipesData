Gradually add 1 cup of sugar, beating until blended.   Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in sour cream, espresso and vanilla.  Pour batter into the baked and cooled crust.\nBake cheesecake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 5 minutes; then turn the oven off, partially open the door and allow the cheesecake to rest for 15 minutes more. Remove from the oven, and run a knife around the edges. Cool cheesecake on a wire rack to room temperature, then cover the springform pan with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours.\nTo serve, cut the cheesecake into wedges and garnish each slice with whipped cream and caramel sauce.",
