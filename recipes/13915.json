    "des": "\"These stuffed lasagna noodles really hit the spot. Garnish with chopped parsley or sliced green onions. Serve with a tossed salad, warm garlic bread, and a white zinfandel for a superb meal.  You can use fresh, frozen or canned peas for this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water until al dente.  Rinse, drain, set aside.\nHeat oil in a medium saute pan.  Add mushrooms, onions, carrots, peas, and broccoli; saute over medium heat until tender. Add wine and garlic; cook five minutes, or until wine has just about evaporated. Remove from heat, and cool for ten minutes.\nIn a medium bowl combine sauteed vegetable mixture, mozzarella cheese, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, and egg.  Mix well.\nPour half of the sauce into the bottom of a 13x9x2inch baking pan.  Spread 1/3 cup vegetable mixture over each lasagna noodle then carefully roll up the noodle.   Place seam side down in dish. When finished placing all the noodles in the pan, pour remaining pasta sauce evenly over noodles.  Cover with aluminum foil.\nBake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes. Uncover, and sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese over noodles. Bake, uncovered, 5 more minutes. Garnish and serve immediately.",
