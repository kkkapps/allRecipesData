    "ins": "In a large skillet heat oil over medium high heat. Add onion and saute until translucent. Add thyme, basil, parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add sherry, reduce heat to medium low and let all simmer.\nMeanwhile, cut liver into small pieces, about the size of large sugar lumps, and add liver pieces to skillet mixture. Cook all together, shaking skillet well, for 6 to 7 minutes. Add more sherry if mixture gets dry. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and fried croutons and serve.\nTo make croutons, drizzle olive oil over cubes of bread, toss to coat all sides. Cook croutons in a heavy skillet over medium heat until golden brown.",
