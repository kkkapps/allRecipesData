    "ins": "Place broccoli florets in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir 2 teaspoons lemon juice into water in a small bowl and pour the mixture into the skillet. Cover and steam until broccoli is bright green and tender, 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhile broccoli is steaming, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and stir in garlic and salt; turn heat to low and let the garlic gently fry until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Drain water from cooked broccoli and return to skillet; sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons lemon juice and the butter and garlic mixture. Sprinkle broccoli with black pepper, toss to combine, and season with a bit more pepper if desired.",
