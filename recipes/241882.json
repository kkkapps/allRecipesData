    "des": "\"Salmon, butter, Dijon mustard, and fresh tarragon are just some of what make this traditional French fare so delicious. This no-bake version is more like a spread, which is perfect for casual parties, and you can make it in any kind of crock or bowl. Pair it with toasted baguette slices for an appetizer or eat as a salad.\"",
    "ins": "Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan and add salt. Add salmon fillet, reduce to a simmer, and cook until just cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer salmon to a plate using a slotted spoon and let cool 10 minutes. Flake salmon into a large bowl, discarding skin, and toss with smoked salmon, green onion, parsley, and tarragon.\nWhisk together butter, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Add mayonnaise mixture to salmon mixture and gently stir until well combined.\nCover and chill 3 hours. Serve with toasted baguette slices or crackers.",
