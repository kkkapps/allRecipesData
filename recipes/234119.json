    "des": "\"Lots of zucchini this year, and I love soup. So what better than to make a zucchini soup? This is a light version, since I am watching my weight. If I were not, I would have used heavy cream and a lot more Romano cheese! Add or subtract any veggies you want. Corn and green beans would also be good. This comes out so creamy and rich tasting, you would never know how light in calories it is.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and carrots in hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini; continue cooking until the zucchini begins to soften, about 5 minutes more. Pour chicken broth over the zucchini mixture, place a cover on the pot, and bring to a boil and cook for 8 minutes. Stir spinach into the mixture; continue cooking until the zucchini is tender, about 2 minutes more.\nMash the zucchini mixture with a potato masher until a desired texture is achieved. Pour potato soup into the zucchini mixture; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir half-and-half and Pecorino Romano cheese into the zucchini mixture; stir. Continue cooking until heated through completely, 2 to 3 minutes.",
