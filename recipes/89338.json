    "des": "\"This casserole is the tastiest chicken dish that I have ever tasted. The sweet potato adds an interesting addition to the chicken, alternatively butternut squash can be used in its place. Everyone I have ever cooked this casserole for has loved it! Serve with rice or mashed potato with fresh, crisp green vegetables.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until just starting to turn golden. Mix in the sweet potatoes and carrot; cook and stir for a few minutes, until lightly browned.\nMove the vegetables to the sides of the pan, leaving the center clear. Add the chicken; cook and stir until seared on all sides. Scatter the flour over the top, and stir it in. Gradually stir in the chicken stock, mixing carefully so that no flour lumps form. Scrape any bits of food from the bottom of the pan while you do this. Pour in the wine last, and mix through. Transfer to a casserole dish and cover with a lid.\nBake for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven, and let it cool just a little before stirring in the cream (or else it may curdle).",
