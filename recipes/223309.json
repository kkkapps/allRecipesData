    "des": "\"These brownies are fudgy and don't have to bake long because the first step is to cook the chocolate peanut-butter mixture on the stove like candy. Avocado is substituted for butter to make a smooth rich baked good without the butterfat.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.\nMelt peanut butter, chocolate chips, and sugar together in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and continue stirring until mixture begins to bubble, about 5 more minutes. Remove from heat.\nBlend avocado, soy milk, and canola oil in a food processor until smooth. Stir avocado mixture into chocolate mixture until thoroughly combined.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl until well mixed. Add avocado-chocolate mixture to the flour mixture; stir until just combined. Pour batter evenly into the prepared baking pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to become crisp, about 20 minutes. Cool brownies completely before cutting and serving.",
