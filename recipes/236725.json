    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.\nStir oats, whole wheat flour, kamut flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom together in a bowl. Add apples and toss to coat.\nBeat buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and honey together in a separate bowl.\nMake a well in the center of oat mixture; pour buttermilk mixture into the well. Mix until batter is just moistened. Set aside to soften oats, about 5 minutes. Generously fill muffin cups with batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden brown and spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes.",
