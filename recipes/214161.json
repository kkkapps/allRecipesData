    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.\nCombine the water and butter with 1/8 teaspoon salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium, and pour in the flour all at once. Stir vigorously until the mixture forms a semi-translucent ball. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes.\nMix in the eggs into the dough, one at a time, adding the next egg only after the first has been completely incorporated. Drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet by the heaping tablespoon.\nBake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. The puffs should be hollow on the inside, and just browned on the bottom. Remove from the oven, and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.\nTo prepare the filling, stir together the onion, celery, raisins, mustard, mayonnaise, yogurt, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and dill in a bowl until combined. Fold in the chopped chicken meat until evenly combined. Cut the tops from the puffs, and spoon the chicken filling inside. Replace the tops before serving.",
