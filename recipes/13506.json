    "des": "\"This recipe was graciously shared with me by a Jamaican friend many years ago. It makes a delicious sauce, different from any other cranberry sauce I've ever tasted or made. It does not 'gel,' but you do want to cook it long enough to make a good, thick consistency.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium saucepan, combine cranberries, orange zest, cinnamon, orange juice, and brown sugar. Add enough water to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately reduce heat, and simmer for about 1 hour, or until the sauce has thickened. Taste for sweetness, and adjust with additional sugar if necessary. You can not overcook, so continue cooking until you have a good thick consistency. Let mixture cool, then refrigerate in a covered container.",
