    "des": "\"My own recipe for delicious pumpkin frozen yogurt using my favorite formula of 2 cups yogurt, 1 cup whipping cream.  Just creamy enough to suit our taste, fewer calories than ice cream, and great pumpkin fall-time flavor. I churned it using my KitchenAid\u00c2\u00ae Ice Cream Bowl Attachment. Hope you enjoy it.\"",
    "ins": "Combine the yogurt, cream, sugar, pumpkin puree, brandy, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk together until the sugar and salt have completely dissolved. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.\nPour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches \"soft-serve\" consistency, about 20 minutes. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded container. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
