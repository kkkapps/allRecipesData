    "des": "\"This recipe has been tested by many of my foodie family members and friends and heartily approved. So good, so creamy, insanely delicious! I make them even more than regular cheesecakes. These beauties contain 3 ingredients in the crust: Weetabix\u00e2\u201e\u00a2, dates, and walnuts (or almonds).\nThese are extremely delicious plain, but to pork them up a bit I topped them with blueberries, caramel, and peanut butter.\"",
    "ins": "Combine dates and walnuts in a food processor; pulse until a loose dough forms. Mix in wheat cereal biscuits until a pliable dough forms.\nGrease a muffin tin lightly with cooking spray. Line muffin cups with strips of parchment paper.\nDrop 1 tablespoon of dough into each muffin cup; press over the bottom with your fingers. Freeze until firm, 10 to 15 minutes.\nCombine soaked cashews, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut milk, maple syrup, coconut oil, and lemon juice in a blender; blend until smooth.\nDivide cashew mixture evenly among muffin cups. Tap muffin tin against a work surface to release any air bubbles in the cashew mixture. Cover with plastic wrap. Freeze until firm, 4 to 6 hours.\nPull cheesecakes out of muffin cups using the parchment paper ends. Drizzle caramel sauce and peanut butter on top; garnish with blueberries.",
