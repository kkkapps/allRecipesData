    "ins": "Heat shallots, garlic, blackberry jam, and red wine in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup of liquid, about 15 minutes. Strain liquid through a fine mesh sieve and set aside. Heat the beef broth in a separate skillet over medium-high heat until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Whisk the two reduced sauces together, and stir in the butter. Season with salt and pepper.\nHeat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the venison steaks until they are beginning to firm, and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Serve the steaks with the sauce and a few fresh blackberries.",
