    "des": "\"These are great little broccoli appetizers shaped into balls that are baked (not fried).  They can also be made ahead of time and frozen. Can be served warm or cold.  Always a hit with company.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook broccoli according to package directions. Drain, and cool.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, onion, parsley, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Stir in the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, margarine and milk. Mix in the broccoli last. Let the mixture stand for about 10 minutes. It should thicken, but if not, add a little more bread crumbs. Roll the mixture into small balls, and arrange on a greased baking sheet.\nBake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm and lightly toasted.",
