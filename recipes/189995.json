    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nWhisk melted butter and milk together with a fork. Soak the bread slices in the milk mixture, turning to cover both sides completely. Sprinkle half of the thyme over one side of the bread pieces.\nHeat a dry skillet over medium-low heat, and fry the bread, thyme-side down, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining thyme over the bread; turn over and fry until lightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet; sprinkle with the Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly, about 10 minutes. Remove and serve immediately with salt and cracked pepper.",
