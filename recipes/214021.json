    "des": "\"Delicious delicately spiced chicken that is far from the norm for the American palate but not too weird so that even kids will eat it. Chicken is pleasantly saucy and goes well with rice.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned lightly brown, about 7 minutes. Remove onion from skillet, and set aside.\nIncrease heat to medium-high. Season one side of the chicken thighs with half of the garam masala and curry powder. Place the chicken seasoned-side down into the skillet, and season the other side with the remaining garam masala and curry powder. Continue cooking chicken until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes on each side. Pour in the red wine and red wine vinegar. Simmer for about 30 seconds, scraping up and browned bits from the pan. Stir in the prepared onion and chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer the chicken thighs until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.",
