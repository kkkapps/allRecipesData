    "des": "\"This is a creamy pie, not a dense cheesecake. For crust-challenged individuals (like myself), this is for you. The crust is cookie-like. Whenever I am invited to visit friends and ask if I can bring something, they always request this pie.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nMix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, shortening, 2 eggs, baking powder, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until dough comes together.\nPress dough into a 9-inch pie dish, reserving about 1 tablespoon of dough for topping.\nBeat ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth; pour cheese filling into prepared pie dish.\nDivide reserved dough into 3 balls. Flatten balls and arrange atop pie filling.\nSprinkle a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of sugar over pie, if desired.\nBake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and filling begins to firm, about 75 minutes.\nChill pie in refrigerator until fully firm, about 3 hours.",
