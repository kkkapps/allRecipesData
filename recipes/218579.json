Fluff with a fork.\nWhisk together the soy sauce, water, honey, cider vinegar, and cornstarch in a small bowl.  Set the sauce aside.\nHeat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cook for 10 seconds. Add the broccoli, carrots, onion, and black pepper; cook and stir until the broccoli and carrots are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside.\nReturn the skillet to the heat and pour in the sauce mixture; cook for 1 minute. Add the shrimp to the sauce and stir until the shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center and the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir the vegetables back into the pan and serve over the brown rice.",
