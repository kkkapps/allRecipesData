    "des": "\"An apple is filled with a cinnamon cheesecake center.  I used a Braeburn apple but any variety will work.  Great for a cold night! Serve with whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCut the stem out of the apple and hollow out the center until it is about 1 1/2 inches wide without going through the bottom.  In a small cup, stir together the cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Set aside half of this mixture, and mix the rest with the cream cheese and dried cranberries.\nSprinkle some of the reserved cinnamon sugar into the apple's cavity. Fill with the cream cheese mixture, and sprinkle the remaining cinnamon sugar on the top. Place the apple in a small baking dish.\nBake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the apple is tender enough to easily pierce with a fork.",
