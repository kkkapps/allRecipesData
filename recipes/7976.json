Press firmly on the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan.\nIn a large bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sweetened condensed milk. Mix in eggs one at a time, blending well after each. Stir in 1/4 cup rum, vanilla extract, and nutmeg.  Pour into the prepared pan.\nBake in preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until set.
