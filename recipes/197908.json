    "des": "\"Boulettes is French for 'little balls.' These combine the naturally sweet taste of crawfish tails with the Cajun 'Trinity' of onions, bell peppers, and celery, with an extra kick from the Cajun seasoning. They are deep fried until golden brown and delicious. You will love these!\"",
    "ins": "Place the crawfish tails, chopped onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic, stale bread, and egg into the bowl of a food processor. Add the salt, black pepper, and 2 teaspoons of Cajun seasoning. Cover and pulse until the crayfish mixture is finely chopped. Scrape into a bowl and fold in the parsley and green onions. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk the bread crumbs and 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning together in a bowl; set aside.\nForm the crawfish mixture into 1 tablespoon-size balls and roll in the bread crumbs. Cook in batches in the hot oil until the balls turn golden brown and begin to float, about 4 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and serve hot.",
