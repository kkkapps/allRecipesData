    "des": "\"My daughter and I found this recipe several years ago, and since then it has become a regular on our Christmas menu.\n Strangely, this dish appeals especially to women. Women always return for seconds and request the recipe, while men may politely try a bite or two. \nWe serve it mainly with chicken or turkey. With an apple or banana on the side, it also makes a filling and nutritious packed lunch. Somehow the sweet potato sticks by you so that you're not reaching for a snack at mid-afternoon.\"",
    "ins": "Place sweet potato into a microwave steamer with a rack; add water. Cook in the microwave until sweet potato is soft but not mushy, about 8 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.\nPeel cooled sweet potato and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.\nCut each orange segment into 3 pieces. Place sweet potato and orange pieces in a bowl; add raisins.\nMix lemon juice and honey together in a bowl; pour over potato-orange mixture. Add a pinch of salt and sprinkle walnuts over salad.",
