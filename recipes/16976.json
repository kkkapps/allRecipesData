    "des": "\"This casserole combines the flavors of sour cream, cream cheese and creamy chicken and mushroom soups, all topped with buttery, round crackers. Super easy to make - not the prettiest looking dish, but tastes great and kids love it! My sister-in-law gave this to me a few years back.\"",
    "ins": "In a large saucepan over medium low heat combine the chicken, cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, cream cheese, sour cream and 2/3 of the cracker crumbs. Mix well and cook until all blended together and cream cheese has melted.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nTransfer casserole mixture into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and top with remaining cracker crumbs.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 15 minutes or until crackers turn golden brown. Spoon into bowls and enjoy!",
