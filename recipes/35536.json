    "ins": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat.\nPrepare four foil squares large enough to fold over one potato each.   Spread butter onto foil in a large enough area that the potato will be completely covered when rolled up.  Sprinkle salt, garlic, pepper, and Italian seasoning evenly over foil.  Roll each potato in the foil; puncture the package (including the potato) with a fork or knife a few times.\nGrill for 1 hour, or until soft, turning the potatoes often.  Serve with your favorite toppings.",
