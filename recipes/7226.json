    "ins": "In a large bowl mix the starter, egg, vegetable oil, sugar and vanilla together. Stir in the salt, buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda and ginger. Mix until just combined. Adjust consistency with more flour or some water, depending upon how thick your starter is. The batter should be pourable, but not runny.\nHeat a griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease griddle and ladle 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter onto hot greased griddle. Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes or until top is full of bubbles. Use a spatula to turnover and cook other side for and additional 2 minutes or so. Serve hot!",
