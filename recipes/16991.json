    "des": "\"There is an outdoor country-style restaurant in Havana, Cuba that serves only white rice, French fries and a delightful chicken with all the sauce you want. Someone gave me this recipe, and it's similar to the one served at that restaurant. The orange juice and lemon juice give it a sweet, pungent flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute; set aside.\nIn a separate medium bowl, combine the remaining oil, onion, orange juice, lemon juice and wine. Add the heated garlic and oil to this and mix well.\nPlace chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour the juice mixture over the chicken, coating well.\nBake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, basting occasionally with the sauce.",
