    "des": "\"I noticed that most (all?) the pizza sauce recipes call for either tomato paste or tomato sauce or both. I wanted to do it from scratch! So I experimented until I got it right. This is much better than the store-bought sauce with none of those nasty preservatives.\"",
    "ins": "Place tomatoes, water, and olive oil in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Transfer tomato mixture to a large pot.\nStir sugar, garlic salt, and vinegar into tomato mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.\nPour tomato sauce into a clean blender or food processor no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until tomato sauce is very smooth.",
