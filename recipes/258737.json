And this recipe isn't just for ice pops; pour the mix into an ice cream maker for smooth, chocolaty ice cream, whip up with a beater for a velvety mousse, or drizzle it on ice cream or other desserts for a decadent sauce. It'\ns even a delicious frosting! The possibilities are endless.\"",

Blend on high until mixture is thick and fluffy like pudding, about 2 minutes.\nFill disposable cups with the mixture, smoothing over the tops. Insert sticks.\nFreeze until solid, at least 3 hours.\nRun hot water over the bottoms of the cups until the fudge pops slide out easily.",
