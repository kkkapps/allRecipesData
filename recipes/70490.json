Cover the chicken with half of the tortilla pieces. Pour half of the sauce on top of the tortillas; sprinkle half the Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the dish. Repeat the layers with the rest of the ingredients.\nBake in preheated oven until all the cheese has melted and sauce mixture is bubbling, 35 to 40 minutes.",
