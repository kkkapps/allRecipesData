Set the onion aside.\nGrind the serrano chile peppers, the juice of 2 limes, and salt together in a food processor until no large chunks of pepper remain. Add 1 avocado and process until creamy and smooth; repeat with remaining avocados. Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl; fold the onion, cilantro, and mango into the avocado mixture.
