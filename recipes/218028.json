    "ins": "Place the chicken strips, chicken broth, white wine, onion, salt, thyme, black pepper, and parsley into a slow cooker, and set the cooker on Low. Cover, and cook for about 5 hours, then raise setting to High. Stir in the mushrooms; mix the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl, and stir the mixture into the slow cooker. Recover, and cook until sauce is thickened, about 20 more minutes.\nMeanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.\nMix the cooked spaghetti, half-and-half, and half the Parmesan cheese into the slow cooker. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese, and serve.",
