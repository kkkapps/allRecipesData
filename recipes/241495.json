Press half of the oat mixture evenly into the prepared pan.\nSpread date mixture evenly over oat mixture; sprinkle remaining oat mixture evenly over date mixture and press down lightly.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled before cutting into squares, about 1 hour.",
