    "des": "\"This delightful dish is made with sauteed rice and onion, then boiled in chicken broth. The curry aroma and hint of ginger help make this mouthwatering cuisine a dish to savor again and again. Hot green pepper sauce (such as Tabasco\u00c2\u00ae) makes a great addition to the finished product.\"",
