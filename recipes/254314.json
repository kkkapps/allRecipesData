    "des": "\"Fast, easy, simple, delicious. Even a klutz like me can manage to make it in no time. It adds a whole lot of flavor to those every day eggs. I made this recipe this morning. It was delicious and left me wanting more. Traditional tamagoyaki is not as flat and uses several eggs, but this is great when you just want a little snack or for breakfast. Kids with a sweet tooth will love it.\"",
    "ins": "Mix water, soy sauce, and sugar together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add egg and beat until egg mixture is combined.\nHeat skillet over medium heat until a drop of water evaporates almost immediately. Pour egg mixture into pan. Cook until the bottom of the omelet has solidified, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and fold omelet into a square and transfer to a plate.",
