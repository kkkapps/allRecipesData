Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Working with each color, shape dough into 3/4 inch balls. For each cookie place 1 pink, 1 green, 1 blue and 1 orange ball together to make 1 large rainbow colored ball.  Shape into a 12 inch long roll (like a snake); starting at one end, coil roll to make a 2 3/4 inch round cookie.  Place cookies 3 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet.  Carefully insert lollipop sticks into bottoms of cookie\nBake cookies for 8 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool and store in an airtight container.",
