    "des": "\"I was not feeling well one evening and wanted soup. But I only had chicken broth and that sounded boring. I'd made egg drop soup before and thought that sounded perfect, so I started looking up recipes. Since I couldn't quite make any of the ones I found, I combined them to make this. It helped settle my stomach and was super easy to make. Garnish with crushed peanuts, chives, chili sauce, red pepper flakes, and lime wedges.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir udon pieces into broth and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but are still firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.\nWhisk water and cornstarch together in a bowl. Whisk cornstarch mixture into broth mixture until smooth and thickened slightly. Gradually pour in eggs, stirring gently and constantly, until eggs are wispy and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with sea salt and black pepper.",
