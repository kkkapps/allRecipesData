    "ins": "Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Avoid over cooking to prevent skins from splitting. Drain. Refrigerate until chilled through.\nCombine paprika, salt, pepper and cayenne.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.\nPeel the fully chilled potatoes. Grate the potatoes using course box grater or food processor.\nLayer half the potatoes into the buttered baking dish, season with a sprinkling of prepared seasoning blend, half the diced green onions, some parsley, and half a jar of the Alfredo sauce. Repeat layers ending with the remaining sauce and a sprinkling of the seasoning. Reserve some green onions and parsley for garnish.\nBake until hot and slightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes.\nGarnish with reserved green onions and parsley.",
