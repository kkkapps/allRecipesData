    "des": "\"This is in response to Carol's request for what she called 'Futimonbuckles' but in Norwegian - Fattigmann Bakkels would sound the way she spelled it.  This is a very old recipe that dates back over a 100 years and actually means 'Poor Man's Cakes'.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, beat egg and yolks together. Stir in the cream, sugar, melted butter and cardamom. Mix in enough of the flour to make a soft but manageable dough. Handle the dough as little as possible or cookies will be tough.\nHeat oil in deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a floured cloth, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 2x2 inch diamond shapes.\nFry in hot lard until lightly browned. Drain on paper and dust with confectioners' sugar when cool. The cookies should be uniform in size and thickness and shouldn't be fried too dark or too light.",
