    "des": "\"We are remodeling the kitchen and getting very hungry for food again so I got out the slow cooker and made this soup.  It's perfect when you do not have a lot of time.  Since you can get soup bones that contain little fat, this soup is nearly fat-free.  When the soup is cooled there is no visible fat at the surface.\"",
    "ins": "Place beef bones in a large size slow cooker.  Add salt, celery stalks, onion, bouquets garnis, pepper, carrots, parsley and garlic.  Fill slow cooker within 2 inches of  the top with hot water and cook for 6 hours, covered on high heat, stirring occasionally.\nAdd barley and cook for 2 more hours stirring occasionally or until meat can easily be removed from bones.\nRemove and discard onion, bouquets garnis, celery, and parsley.\nTransfer bones to a dish and remove meat from bones, being careful not to take off cartilage or gristle. Place meat back into soup, stir, and serve.",
