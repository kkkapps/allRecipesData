    "ins": "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium -high heat and quickly brown the chicken pieces. Remove and set aside.\nIn the same pot, saute the leeks, onion, celery and salt until the vegetables are tender crisp.  Return the chicken to the pot and add the water, bouillon and nutmeg.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, until the chicken is tender.\nIn a small bowl or cup, combine the flour and lemon juice; pour into the pot and stir.\nBeat the cream and the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons of the hot liquid; stir into pot.  Heat through, but do not allow to boil as the cream will curdle.  Sprinkle in the parsley before serving.",
