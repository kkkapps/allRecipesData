    "des": "\"This is a simple butter cookie that can be used in a cookie press, as a drop cookie or made into a roll and sliced.  There is no mystery cookie for a cookie press...any stiff butter type can be used. Just be sure to chill it thoroughly so it keeps its shape while baking.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, cream together the butter and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Cover dough, and chill for at least one hour. Chill cookie sheets.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press dough out onto ungreased, chilled cookie sheets.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly golden at the edges. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.",
