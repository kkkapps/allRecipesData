    "des": "\"Ah, nothing like the sweet taste of the tropics! Using my leftover coconut bunny cake I created a tiramisu featuring the tropical flavors of pineapple, mango, ginger, and macadamia nuts. My cake was a white cake but a leftover yellow cake would work just as well. Sliced almonds can be substituted for macadamia nuts.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, beat together the cream cheese, honey, and pineapple juice concentrate until light and fluffy; set aside. In a small bowl, combine the mango nectar and rum extract; set aside.\nPlace half of the cake cubes in a 1 1/2 quart glass bowl. Drizzle half of the mango/rum mixture over the cake, then spread half of the cream cheese mixture over the cake. Sprinkle on half of the ginger and nuts. Repeat layers.\nCover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Garnish each serving with fresh mango slices and pineapple.",
