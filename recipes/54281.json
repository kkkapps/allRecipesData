    "des": "\"This is a Greek beef stew made with small onions. This is my mom's recipe, and every Fall without fail you could smell it simmering in the kitchen.  Serve it with a large bowl of mashed potatoes.  Of course a Greek salad, some feta & olives and crusty bread give this meal the final touches.  The onions can be time consuming to clean, but well worth it when your family sits down to eat.\"",
    "ins": "In a large soup pot, cook beef in oil until beef is browned. Remove beef, and set aside. Mix sugar into the drippings, add onions, and cook until golden. Remove onions from pan.\nReturn beef to the pot, and place onions on top.  Mix the tomato paste, wine, and wine vinegar together, and add to saucepan.  Place the garlic, pickling spices, bay leaf, cinnamon, and rosemary  in a spice bag; add to the pan.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover, and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, adding more liquid if necessary.",
