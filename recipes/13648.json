    "des": "\"This recipe has been made and served in my mother's family for as long as I can remember. It is traditionally served with turkey and mashed potatoes. To save fat and calories, I cut the amount of butter and sugar for the topping in half, but for full flavor it is better with the full amount.\"",

Bake for 40 minutes.\nIn a small sauce pan, combine butter, sugar, water and flour. Cook until clear. Once corn mixture is cooked, remove from oven, pour butter and sugar mixture over top and serve.",
