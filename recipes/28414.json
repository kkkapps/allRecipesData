Like stews, sauces, pot roasts etc. These things work for me cause the prep is quick and cook time is usually a no brainer...check every now and then.....and tada...dinner!!!!\"",
    "ins": "Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Briefly brown chicken pieces in batches. When all of the pieces have been browned, return them all to the pot and cover with a layer of sliced onions, and then potatoes. Season with pepper and sprinkle with parsley. Pour the chicken broth over all.\nCover and simmer on low heat for 45 minutes, pushing potatoes down into the liquid occasionally. When potatoes are tender but not mushy, add frozen peas and simmer for 5 more minutes.",
