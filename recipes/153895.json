    "des": "\"Good ol' Southern style spoon bread made with a cornmeal mush which adds extra moistness.\"",
    "ins": "Measure the milk into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cornmeal; cook and stir for several minutes, until cornmeal has absorbed all of the milk. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for about 1 hour. The mixture will be very stiff.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish.\nPlace the cornmeal mixture into a large bowl. Stir in the eggs, salt, baking powder and butter. Pour into the prepared casserole dish.\nBake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges become lightly toasted. Serve hot directly from the dish by the spoonful.",
