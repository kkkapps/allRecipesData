    "des": "\"This is a wonderful hot-sweet appetizer that guests always love -- much to their surprise!  It's great for all occasions, winter and summer.  You can adjust the ingredients based on whether you like it more hot or more sweet, and you can make sugar free, fat free versions, too!  I got this recipe from my mother, and it's been a family favorite for years! If you do not have time to let the apricot mixture chill overnight, it will still taste delicious served immediately. Serve with your favorite crackers.\"",

Cover and chill this mixture overnight.\nWhen ready to serve, place the cream cheese on a serving plate and pour the apricot mixture over the cream cheese. Serve with a basket of your favorite crackers.",
