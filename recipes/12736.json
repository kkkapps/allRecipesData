Grated Parmesan cheese is sprinkled over the top of this baked dish.  Grouper, snapper, and catfish are all good choices for this recipe.\"",

Stirring constantly, cook until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nSelect a pan large enough to accommodate all the fillets in one layer. Coat with cooking spray.  Arrange fish in pan, and cover with shrimp..  Pour white sauce over shrimp.  Sprinkle with grated cheese.\nBake, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes.",
