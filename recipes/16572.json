    "ins": "In a saucepan, melt the butterscotch chips over low heat, stirring frequently. When they are completely melted, remove from the heat and stir in the noodles until they are evenly coated. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. Allow cookies to set up for 20 to 25 minutes, then peel them from the waxed paper and enjoy!",
