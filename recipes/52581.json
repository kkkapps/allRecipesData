    "des": "\"This recipe is so delicious and easy to make.  I come from a really Swedish town - Rockford, Illinois - where Swedish pancakes are a favorite for Sunday morning breakfast.  My Dad used to make these for us at home for a special treat. Serve with butter and maple syrup, or lingonberries if you've got them.\"",
