    "des": "\"This recipe has been modified slightly over tim, but is always a winner, whether for an appetizer or main dish. It even works with winter store-bought tomatoes. The vinegar and basil bring out the flavors.\"",
    "ins": "Combine tomatoes, bell pepper, onion, balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, basil, and garlic; let tomato mixture rest for 15 to 30 minutes.\nSet oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\nArrange French bread slices on a large baking sheet; drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil.\nToast bread in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 1 minute on each side. Top bread slices with tomato mixture using a slotted spoon, allowing excess liquid to drain. Return bread to baking sheet and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.\nBroil in preheated oven until cheese melts, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately.",
