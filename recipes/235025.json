    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nStir green bell pepper and onion together in the bottom of a 9-inch casserole dish. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables; stir to coat.\nCoat chicken breasts completely with a thin layer of hummus and place atop the vegetables. Drizzle lemon juice over the chicken and dust with paprika.\nCook chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
