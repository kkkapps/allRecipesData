    "des": "\"This is a great recipe from a member of our cook-off team. Beef ribs are breaded and deep-fried. This would be best in an outdoor deep-fryer. Two racks of ribs should give you about 6 pounds.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic salt, and onion salt. Place the flour in a separate bowl or plate. Whisk eggs in a large bowl. Rub the spice mixture onto all of the ribs. Dip each rib in egg, then in flour, then egg, then flour again.\nPlace the ribs in a fryer basket so they are not crowded, try 4 or 5 at a time depending on the size of your fryer. Cook for about 8 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain. Continue with remaining ribs.",
