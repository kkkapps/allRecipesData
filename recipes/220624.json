    "des": "\"Fabulous light pasta salad with carrots, asparagus, tomatoes, and green onions. It gets better the longer it marinates, so don't be afraid to prepare it ahead of time and stick it in the refrigerator a few hours.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot with lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook rotini at a boil until the pasta is cooked yet slightly firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.\nRinse the pasta with cold water until completely chilled; drain completely.\nWhile the pasta cooks, whisk the apple cider vinegar and olive oil together in a large bowl until blended. Stir feta cheese, basil, salt, and black pepper into the vinaigrette.\nFold the asparagus, tomatoes, carrots, green onions, and garlic into the vinaigrette to coat evenly.\nStir the cooled pasta into the vegetable mixture; toss until evenly mixed.",
