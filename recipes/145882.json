    "des": "\"This eggplant is great served as a side dish or as a complete meal atop bulgur wheat, or couscous. It's a savory and sweet Mediterranean dish. The almonds are a nice source of protein for vegetarians like myself. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Place the eggplant in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Set the colander in the sink to drain off liquid, about 20 minutes. Pat the cubes with paper towel to remove excess salt.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion in the oil until translucent. Add the garlic; cook and stir another 2 minutes. Stir in the eggplant and almonds, cooking and stirring until the eggplant is tender, but not mushy, about 20 minutes.\nWhen the eggplant is cooked through, mix in the tomatoes, mint, white wine, sugar, salt, and chili powder. Cook mixture for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; remove from heat and garnish with parsley.",
