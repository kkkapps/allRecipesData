In a separate bowl, stir together the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla. Mix in the eggs. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients just until blended. Fold in chocolate chips and pecans if using. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan and the top appears dry, 35 to 40 minutes.",
