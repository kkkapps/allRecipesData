    "des": "\"An incredibly moist and light cake made with cake mix, strawberry gelatin and fresh strawberries. Great for summer picnics and get-togethers. Can be made to be very low fat by using an egg substitute and applesauce instead of oil in the cake mix and using fat free topping.\"",
    "ins": "Prepare cake according to package directions. Bake as directed for a 9x13 inch pan. Allow to cool.\nPrepare the strawberry gelatin according to package instructions, using the 4 cups of water. Pour over cooled cake while still in liquid form; the cake will absorb it. Chill in refrigerator for 2 hours, or until gelatin is set.\nSpread whipped topping over cake and top with sliced strawberries.",
