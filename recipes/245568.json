    "des": "\"I love to eat at places like Qdoba\u00c2\u00ae and Chipotle\u00c2\u00ae, so I created my own chicken burrito at home, minus the tortilla! This is very easy for a weeknight meal and is very filling and healthy; the recipe can easily be increased for more people.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.\nSeason chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.\nGrill chicken until no longer pink in the center and cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips or bite-sized pieces.\nWarm corn and black beans in separate saucepans over medium-low heat, covered, until heated through, about 5 minutes.\nLayer cooked rice, corn, black beans, and chicken on 2 serving plates. Top with Monterey Jack cheese, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream.",
