Cool until hardened and set.\nToss lettuce, blackberries, and feta cheese together in a large bowl.\nPour lemon juice into a small bowl. Drizzle in olive oil, whisking constantly until blended into the lemon juice. Whisk sesame oil into the dressing.\nBreak up cooled almonds and add to the salad. Mix dressing into the salad.",
