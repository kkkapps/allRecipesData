    "des": "\"A great way to use up leftovers, hash is a fast and simple meal. This recipe uses pulled pork from pork shoulders I cooked on my Weber\u00c2\u00ae Smokey Mountain last weekend. It's great for a quick dinner or relaxed breakfast. The secret to crispy hash is using precooked potatoes. Goes great with biscuits, too.\"",
    "ins": "Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in melted butter until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add pork and continue to cook for 2 minutes more.\nStir potatoes into pork mixture and toss. Cook until potatoes are browned, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.",
