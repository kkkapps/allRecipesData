Coat breasts in flour mixture and fry in a large skillet with 1/4 cup oil and clarified butter for about 5 to 7 minutes each side, or until golden brown and cooked through (juices run clear).\nWhen ready to serve, place chicken on a platter and top with warm sauce; do this right before serving, to retain crispiness of the chicken.",
