    "des": "\"My dad has been making beef jerky for about as long as I can remember.  He started on an outdoor smoker before graduating to an indoor dehydrator.  He has gotten my husband addicted to it.  You can use any type of meat that you like.  I usually look for large inexpensive roasts with as little fat and marbling as possible.\"",
    "ins": "Stir together soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, and hot pepper sauce in a bowl. Season with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and sugar; stir until mixed.\nTo use, toss one pound of thinly sliced meat with the marinade until well coated. Place into a resealable plastic bag, and squeeze out the air. Marinate in the refrigerator for 48 hours, mixing twice. Remove meat from marinade, and discard excess marinade. Prepare jerky according to the manufacturer's directions of your smoker or dehydrator.",
