    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Lightly grease baking sheet.\nIn a saucepan melt chocolate over low heat. Let cool.\nIn a small bowl mix flour, baking powder and salt.\nIn a medium bowl beat margarine on low speed until smooth. Add sugar and beat until creamy. Stir in egg, vanilla and chocolate.  Add flour mixture and mix well, forming a stiff dough.\nTo make spider, shape a 2 inch flat oval for the body. Make the spider's head by flattening a circle about 1/2 inch wide. Shape dough for legs each about 2 inches long and less than 1/4 inch wide.\nAttach the head and legs to body. Put two red candies into head for eyes. Bake for 5-8 minutes.  Let spiders cool on baking sheet to avoid breaking when moving.",
