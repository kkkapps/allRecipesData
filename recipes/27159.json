    "des": "\"This recipe is from Guatemala and it can be used as a dessert or an appetizer or a just because recipe.  My grandmother taught me how to make it and if you are looking for something really different, then you just found what you are looking for!  Make as much as you want and eat with a plain or with a little sugar on top or with sour cream like we do in Guatemala!\"",
    "ins": "Place the plantains in water to cover in a large pot.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until tender, 15 minutes.  Drain and mash.\nIn a small saucepan over low heat, heat the refried beans.  Stir in the sugar and salt.  Remove from heat.\nTo make the rellenitos, form a palm-sized amount of mashed plantains into a ball; flatten and place about a teaspoon of the bean mixture in the middle; then mold the sides of the plantain around the beans, making an egg-shaped ball.\nHeat oil in a deep-fryer or large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), or until a small amount of batter sizzles and browns in the oil.  Fry rellenitos in oil until browned.  Drain on paper towels.",
