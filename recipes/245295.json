    "des": "\"Deep-fried tofu that is crisp and golden brown on the outside and amazingly white and soft on the inside! Serve with your favorite Asian dish or dipping sauce. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to several days or freeze for several weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Wrap tofu in a clean towel and place onto a plate. Set another plate on top, and place a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for about 20 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid.\nCut tofu into 1-inch by 2-inch chunks. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt onto one slide; flip over and sprinkle remaining 1/4 teaspoon on the other.\nHeat oil in a wok or large skillet. To test if the oil is ready, dip a chopstick or wooden spoon in it; if bubbles rise, it is ready. If the oil smokes, it is too hot.\nGently place 5 to 8 pieces of tofu at a time in hot oil using metal tongs. Be very careful as oil may splatter; use a splatter guard if possible. Fry tofu until golden, 3 to 4 minutes.\nDrain tofu on a plate lined with several paper towels. Allow to cool slightly before serving.",
