    "ins": "Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add clams, and boil until all of the clams are open, about 5 minutes. Drain, and remove the empty half of the shell from each one. Place the full halves onto a baking sheet.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the crackers, garlic powder, and parsley into a large resealable bag. Crush until fine, and mash to mix. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the cracker crumb mixture, and cook until golden brown, stirring constantly. Spoon onto the clams in the shells.\nBake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned and topping is crispy. Serve with lemon and hot pepper sauce.",
