    "des": "\"Quick, easy, and impressive! Cooked shrimp and other colorful munchies are displayed on a Christmas tree created with beet greens wrapped around a cone shape.  Vary the size of the cone and type/amount of veggies to personalize this for your party needs. Using purchased sauces for dipping makes this even easier. Display on a colorful Christmas plate and watch the snackers un-decorate!\"",
    "ins": "Wrap a 9 inch tall Styrofoam cone with aluminum foil, covering completely. Use toothpicks to attach beet greens, with the undersides facing outward, to the cone. Cut off the exposed pieces of toothpick with strong scissors. Place the slice of cheese on a dry serving plate. Set the cone onto the cheese to anchor.\nUse frilly toothpicks to attach shrimp, baby corn, black olives, green olives and jalapeno slices to the cone to look like decorations. Scatter any leftover vegetables around the base of the tree. Serve with your choice of colorful purchased dipping sauces, like cocktail sauce, remoulade sauce, or guacamole.",
