    "ins": "In a large bowl, mash the bananas.  Mix in milk, eggs and margarine until smooth.  In a separate bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Stir dry ingredients into banana mixture.\nHeat oil in a deep fryer or heavy bottomed pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Drop batter by spoonfuls into hot oil, and cook, turning once, until browned, 2 to 8 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and dust with confectioners' sugar.",
