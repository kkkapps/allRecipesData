    "des": "\"My boys always begged for this chicken. It literally falls off the bones and the sauce gives a rich flavor to the rice.  Made with pantry staples, it's easy to throw together, too! Use low-sodium soy sauce if you're sensitive to salt. My family prefers chicken thighs but any pieces will work. Skin the chicken pieces if preferred. A zesty Italian dressing works best.\"",
    "ins": "Combine chicken pieces, Italian salad dressing, mushrooms, water, soy sauce, dried minced onion, brown sugar, garlic powder, and black pepper in a heavy skillet or Dutch oven over low heat. Cover and simmer until chicken is very tender, about 45 minutes. Serve over hot cooked rice.",
