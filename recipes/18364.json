    "des": "\"German pastry sandwiches filled with meat, cabbage and onions. If preferred, use any plain roll dough of your choice. Pastries can be frozen and reheated.\"",
    "ins": "Roll out dough to 1/4 inch in thickness, then cut into 5 inch squares.\nIn a large skillet, cook beef and sausage over medium heat until browned; make sure there is no remaining pink color. Stir in cabbage, onions and salt with meat. Saute for about 20 minutes. Turn down heat to warm.\nFill each dough square with a tablespoon of meat filling. Seal dough by bringing the four corners up and then overlapping them. Place pastry upside down on a baking sheet; brush each roll with melted butter.\nAllow rolls to rise for 1 hour and then bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 25 minutes.",
