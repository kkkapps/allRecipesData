    "des": "\"I've had this muesli every time my family and I went to Harrison Hot Springs in Canada. They served it at the breakfast buffet. I could never get a recipe but I think it's pretty close to the real thing! It's different but very good! I recommend making this the night before to have in the morning - a very fast, easy breakfast.\"",
