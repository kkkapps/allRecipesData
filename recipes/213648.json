    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place the chicken breasts into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.\nWhile the chicken is baking, bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, and simmer the asparagus spears until bright green, about 5 minutes. Remove the asparagus and set aside. Mix together the soup and milk in a bowl until well blended. Remove the chicken from the baking dish and set aside. Line the bottom of the dish with asparagus spears, arrange the chicken on top, and pour the soup mixture over the chicken. Sprinkle the top with bread crumbs.\nReturn to oven and bake until the casserole is hot and bubbling, an additional 25 minutes.",
