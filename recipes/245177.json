    "des": "\"Pillowy, fluffy, light frosting that goes well with any cake and holds its shape on cupcakes! Simple ingredients. Old-fashioned is always best; tried and true! Add food coloring for more festive frosting.\"",
    "ins": "In the bowl of a stand mixer, blend egg whites and salt together in a bowl on medium speed until soft peaks form.\nMeanwhile, bring corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan; add marshmallows and stir until melted.\nRaise mixer speed to high. Very carefully, pour the hot syrup in a steady stream between the side of the mixing bowl and the moving beater. Beat until mixture is cool enough to touch; mix in vanilla extract. Makes enough to frost a 9x13-inch cake or an 8-inch layer cake.",
