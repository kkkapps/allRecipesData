While peanuts are good for you, the unhealthy additives and hydrogenated oils are not. This is all natural with no preservatives and has a much better flavor than store-bought peanut butter. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.\"",
    "ins": "Combine peanuts and honey in a food processor; process until peanuts are coarsely chopped, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape down sides of the food processor bowl with a spatula. Continue processing until very smooth, 2 to 3 minutes more.",
