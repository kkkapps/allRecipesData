    "des": "\"I love lentils and split peas (no need to soak) so here is my recipe for a hearty comfort food soup. Using the pressure cooker is wonderful because after working all day, this is a quick and energy-saving way to make a meal in around 30 minutes! Serve with a nice hearty piece of warm bread.\"",
    "ins": "Place the lentils, split peas, onion, carrots, garlic, and cumin into a pressure cooker, and stir in the chicken broth. Seal the cooker, bring to pressure over medium heat, and reduce heat to keep the pressure stable; cook under pressure for 30 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow pressure to subside. When the cooker is at normal pressure, remove the cover, season with salt and pepper and stir in lemon juice to serve.",
