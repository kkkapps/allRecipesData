    "des": "\"I came up with this recipe when I found myself with a plethora of frozen peas. A friend of mine was leaving the country for 6 weeks and I ended up with 5 bags of frozen peas from her freezer. This is a heavier, sweeter twist to traditional basil pesto. Goes well with pasta or spread over bread and covered with cheese...yum! Add more lemon juice, basil, or garlic to taste.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil; add the peas and cook until softened. Drain.\nBlend the peas, Parmesan cheese, garlic, lemon juice, basil, and pepper in a blender; while the it blends, stream the olive oil into the mixture.",
