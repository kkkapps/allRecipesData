    "des": "\"This is an award-winning recipe from the VA Tech Home Sweet Home Contest that I made up. It's a truly wonderful, rich, and delightful dessert. It's a small personal apple pie with a great crumb topping, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and warm caramel sauce. It's a nice way to end a lovely dinner.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 16 individual muffin cups with cooking spray. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\nSplit biscuits in half. Place 1 half in each muffin cup; press biscuit dough to cover the bottom and sides of each cup.\nPlace apple pie filling in a bowl; cut up larger pieces of apples. Mix in vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Divide filling among dough-lined cups.\nCombine remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, flour, brown sugar, and nutmeg in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle over pie filling and gently press down.\nBake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 13 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Carefully transfer to serving plates; cool for 5 minutes more. Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel topping.",
