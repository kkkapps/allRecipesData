Slice bottoms of peppers if needed so they stand upright.\nMix rice, bison, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, all-purpose seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon rice-bison mixture into each bell pepper.\nMix diced tomatoes and Italian seasoning together in a bowl; pour over stuffed peppers.\nBake in the preheated oven, basting with diced tomatoes mixture every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.",
