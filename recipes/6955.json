    "des": "\"This is a basic delicious Italian bread.\"",
    "ins": "Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water and let proof.\nStir in 4 cups of flour and beat until smooth. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.\nBeat in the salt and then add enough remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Knead until as soft and smooth as a bambino's behind. Turn in a greased bowl, cover, and let double in size. (I put it in the oven with the light on - perfect rising temperature.)\nOnce doubled, punch down and divide into three. Place back in the bowl, cover, and let rise.\nOnce doubled again, punch down and form into three fat \"footballs.\" Grease heavy cookie sheets and sprinkle with corn meal. Place the bread on the sheets, cover with a towel, and let rise.\nOnce risen, mist with water and place in a preheated 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) oven. Mist loaves with water and turn occasionally while they bake. Bread is done when golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.",
