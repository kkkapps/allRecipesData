The family enjoyed them so much, I will make them from scratch from now on.\"",
    "ins": "Beat butter in a bowl in a stand mixer until smooth and creamy.\nMix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt together in a bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to butter and beat using the paddle attachment. Add just enough cold water to mixture until dough pulls away from the side of bowl.\nForm dough into 3-inch balls and flatten each with a press or between 2 small plates covered in plastic wrap.\nHeat a skillet over medium heat and cook dough until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side.",
