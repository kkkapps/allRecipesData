    "ins": "Cook syrup, sugar, and water to soft ball stage (a small amount dropped into cold water forms a soft ball).\nPour half of this mixture over stiffly beaten egg whites. Stir.\nCook remaining sugar mixture to brittle stage (a small amount dropped into cold water turns immediately brittle).\nAdd to previous mixture and beat until candy will hold its shape. Beat again by hand to re-aerate it. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. Allow to harden as it cools. Store in refrigerator with waxed paper between layers.",
