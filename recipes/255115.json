    "ins": "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; arrange chile peppers cut-side down on top.\nRoast under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes.\nPlace blackened peppers into a bowl and seal tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins. Chop flesh.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage and bacon; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add onion; cook and stir until golden, 3 to 5 minutes.\nPour water into the skillet; bring to a boil. Add rice. Reduce heat; simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Fold in chopped peppers before serving.",
