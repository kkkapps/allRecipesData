    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly dust a baking sheet with flour.\nWhisk the 2 cups flour, salt, baking soda, and cream of tartar together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir the buttermilk into the flour mixture until moistened.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, for five or six turns. Pat or roll the dough to about 1-inch thick. Cut into rounds with a floured 2-inch cutter and arrange rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops of the scones with milk and sprinkle with cinnamon.\nBake in the preheated oven until the scones have risen and are golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.",
