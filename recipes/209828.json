    "des": "\"Slow-cooked chicken in a rich tomato sauce with flavorful orzo.  A very simple and classic Greek recipe. Top with grated Mizithra, Parmesan, Kefalotyri, or any other hard, white, and salty cheese.\"",
    "ins": "Warm the oil in a large, wide pot over medium heat. Cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Brown the chicken legs in the pot on all sides. Add the garlic; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Pour the tomato sauce and water over the chicken. Drop the bay leaves into the pot. Season with cloves, salt, and pepper. Lower the heat to medium-how; allow the mixture to simmer until the chicken meat is very tender and begins to pull off the bone, about 45 minutes.\nStir the orzo into the liquid in the pot and cook until the orzo is soft, another 15 to 25 minutes. Remove the bay leaves to serve.",
