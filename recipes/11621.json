    "ins": "In a small saucepan, combine the raisins and the water. Cook over medium heat until just boiling, then remove from heat and set aside to cool.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nIn a large bowl, mix together the melted margarine, sugar, and eggs. Stir in the vanilla, raisins, and the raisin water. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves; stir into the egg mixture. Then stir in the oatmeal. If the batter seems too runny, let it sit for 5 minutes.\nDrop dough by teaspoonfuls onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes in the preheated oven.",
