    "des": "\"A flourless crust is a Passover tradition. It's said that when the Jews escaped from slavery in Egypt, they left so quickly they couldn't wait for their bread to rise. Ever since then, they've marked that exodus by baking without flour and leavening agents like yeast.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nStir cereal, sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in melted butter until mixture is thoroughly moistened. Press mixture onto bottom and up sides of a 9-inch pie plate using a small, dry measuring cup. Bake in preheated oven until crust is browned and crisp, about 17 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool 15 minutes.\nWhisk whole eggs, yolks, lemon juice, butter, and sugar together in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk until egg mixture is as thick as honey, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Let cool 30 minutes.\nBeat heavy cream in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until stiff peaks form; gently fold into lemon mixture. Spoon into pie crust and chill 1 hour. Sprinkle with lemon zest.",
