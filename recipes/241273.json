    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.\nStir one of the raspberry packages together with the sugar and 2 tablespoons apple juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Reserve the second container of raspberries.\nCook the raspberries for about 5 minutes until the sugar is dissolved into the juice, the raspberries start to soften, and the juice comes to a simmer.\nWhisk the remaining tablespoon of apple juice with the cornstarch and add to the simmering raspberries. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, then stir in the remaining fresh raspberries.\nUnfold the thawed puff pastry sheets and cut each sheet into 4 squares.\nBrush the edges of each square with the egg wash and spoon the raspberry filling into the center of each square.\nLift one corner of each square and carefully fold diagonally to make triangle-shaped puff pastry packets, pressing gently to seal the pastry edges.\nTransfer the turnovers to the prepared baking sheets. Brush egg wash on each turnover and sprinkle with raw sugar, if desired.\nBake for about 20 minutes, until the pastries are puffed and golden brown. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before serving.",
