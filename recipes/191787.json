Beat in vanilla and sugar until peaks form. Make sure not to over-beat, or cream will become lumpy and butter-like.\nLayer half the pound cake cubes, half the pudding, half the whipped cream, and half the crushed vanilla wafers in a trifle bowl. Repeat with the remaining cake, pudding, and whipped cream, and top with the remaining crushed wafers. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",
