    "des": "\"These are delicious mushrooms my boyfriend's father made that I tweaked into my own. You can play with different cheeses and sauces including salad dressings. I have found these to be my favorites. I have taken the stems, put them in a food processor and then combined them with some butter and flour to make a steak sauce that is delicious! Nothing goes to waste!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\nBroil the mushrooms on the baking sheet stem-side-down for 5 minutes to soften. Remove from the oven, and turn the mushroom caps over. Place a dab of the steak sauce into each cap, then place a piece of brie on top. Return to the oven, and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 5 minutes more.",
