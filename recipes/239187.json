Bring the water to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low.\nStir tomato paste, garlic, brown sugar, and paprika into the lentil mixture to integrate the paste smoothly into the liquid; bring to a simmer and cook until the lentils are tender, about 1 hour.\nStir kale into the lentils, reduce heat to low, and cook until the kale is tender, 10 to 15 minutes; season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
