    "des": "\"Pork chops with vinegar and anchovy sauce is a recipe handed down by a friend who owns an Italian restaurant. Serve this savory dish with fluffy mashed potatoes and fried apple rings.\"",
    "ins": "Pound pork chops to 1/4 inch thickness. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a  skillet over medium-high heat and brown pork on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Drain fat. Pour water, vinegar, salt, and pepper in pan. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook chops until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove chops from skillet, leaving juices, and place on a platter to keep warm.\nMash the anchovy fillets together with 2 teaspoons butter, and 1/2 teaspoon flour. Whisk this paste into the simmering liquid to thicken. Cook and stir until the liquid has thickened and the flour is no longer grainy, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour sauce over pork chops to serve.",
