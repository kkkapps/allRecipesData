    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nSlice the potatoes crosswise (the short way) into 1/4 inch slices, leaving about 1/4 inch on the bottom to connect all of the slices. Place into a baking dish, and slightly fan the slices open. Sprinkle with salt and seasoning blend, and drizzle with butter.\nBake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Sprinkle cheese over the top, and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.",
