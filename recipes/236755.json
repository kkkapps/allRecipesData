Remove crust from oven and cool slightly, leaving oven on.\nPlace serviceberries and water in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes; stir in lemon juice. Whisk white sugar and 2 tablespoons flour together in a small bowl; stir sugar mixture into berries and cook until the mixture begins to thicken, about 3 minutes. Allow to cool for a few minutes; pour berry filling over crumb crust.\nSprinkle cream cheese pieces evenly over berry filling. Spread remaining crumb mixture over cream cheese layer and press gently with a potato masher.\nBake in the preheated oven until crumb topping is golden and filling is bubbly, about 40 minutes.",
