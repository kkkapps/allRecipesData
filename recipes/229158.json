    "ins": "Pour schnapps into a shot glass.\nVery gently pour Irish cream liqueur over the schnapps. Wait until the Irish cream liqueur begins to clump and 'curdle' to look like a brain, just a few moments.\nGently pour a tiny amount of grenadine 'blood' over the brain.\nWatch your guests gag over the look of one of the nastiest-looking Halloween drinks around. But they are yummy!",
