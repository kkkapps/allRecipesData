    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  In a saucepan combine broth, rice and margarine.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed.\nPlace sesame seeds on a small baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden brown; set aside.  Meanwhile, heat peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until very hot.  Add asparagus, bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender but crisp.  Stir in soy-sauce and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove from heat and stir in sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds.  Serve over rice.",
