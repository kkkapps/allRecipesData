Add any veggies you might have left over. I use the end pieces of green beans and whatever 'unwanted' outer parts of vegetables I get from cooking and keep them in a bag in the fridge until the next time I make stock. Even the peels of sweet potatoes and turnips make for good stock.  Don't throw out anything.\"",
