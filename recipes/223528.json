    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water.\nPlace spaghetti into a large salad bowl and toss with red onion, red bell pepper, cucumber, tomato, Italian salad dressing, salad dressing mix, and salt. Chill before serving; salad is better the longer it chills.",
