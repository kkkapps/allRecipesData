Mix in ground sirloin, bacon-onion mixture, Cheddar cheese, pepper jack cheese, eggs, and bread crumbs until thoroughly combined. Form the mixture into a loaf shape and refrigerate 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil and spray the foil with cooking spray.\nPlace loaf into the prepared baking dish. Mix 1/2 cup ketchup, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon chili powder, and 1 teaspoon ground ancho chile in a bowl. Spread the mixture over the loaf.\nBake in the preheated oven until the loaf is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, 1 hour and 5 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
