    "des": "\"This is a sweet fruit salad intended to be served as a low-fat dessert. The syrup is essential; without it, you just have an ordinary fruit salad, for which you probably don't need a recipe! You can vary the fruits to use what you have on hand. This is especially good with strawberries and melon. Bananas might be too overpowering, though.\"",
    "ins": "Place the sugar, water, lemon zest, cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Strain the syrup through a mesh strainer; refrigerate until cold.\nPlace the mango, peaches, apple, raspberries, mint, and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice into a mixing bowl. Pour the chilled syrup overtop and gently stir to combine.",
