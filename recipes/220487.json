    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nBeat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.\nMix the pecan halves into the egg white.\nStir the white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; add to the pecan and egg white mixture and stir.\nCoat the bottom of a jelly roll pan with the softened butter.\nSpread the pecan mixture in an even layer in the prepared pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until crisp, turning occasionally, 45 to 60 minutes.",
