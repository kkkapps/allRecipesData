    "des": "\"I make this for my kids quite often. Great way to get whole grains in them! Preparing the batter in the food processor makes it that much easier, and smoothes out the batter for those who don't like a grainy texture. Serve with syrup and butter or coconut oil. Also delicious with ricotta cheese and strawberries, and just a drizzle of syrup.\"",
    "ins": "Combine buttermilk, flour, oats, amaranth, egg, flax seeds, chia seeds, olive oil, brown sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt in a food processor or blender; blend until smooth.\nHeat vegetable oil on a griddle or skillet over high heat. Pour batter, about 1/4 cup per pancake, onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.",
