    "des": "\"This old recipe for spiced lemonade is really delicious and refreshing. The spices really punch up the flavor and take it to the next level. To serve, pour 1 to 2 tablespoons of the concentrate into the bottom of a cup, add crushed ice, and mix with water, club soda, or ginger ale.\"",
