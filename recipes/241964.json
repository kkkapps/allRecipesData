Cut dough into 10 pieces, roll into balls, and flatten into discs.\nCover dough with a clean kitchen towel and let sit for 20 minutes.\nHeat a cast-iron skillet over-medium high heat.\nRoll out one of the dough discs to about the size of your skillet. Cook in hot skillet until golden and puffy, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove to a platter and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough portions.",
