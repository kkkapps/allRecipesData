    "des": "\"This is one of my favorite recipes.  I have it every time I go to a Thai restaurant topped with coconut ice cream or drizzled with honey.  If you have never tried it, now is the time, it's so good!   I use Nam, a variety of banana which can be found at most Asian Markets.  You can also use sweet potatoes in this recipe.\"",
    "ins": "In a medium bowl, mix rice flour, tapioca, sugar, salt and coconut.  Stir in water, a little at a time, and mix to form a thick batter.\nPeel the bananas and cut each lengthwise into 3 or 4 pieces.  Heat oil in deep-fryer or deep wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCompletely coat each banana slice in batter, then fry in hot oil until golden.  Drain on paper towels.  Serve at once.",
