    "des": "\"Mincemeat muffins are a traditional Thanksgiving and Christmas morning breakfast for our family. They can be made several days ahead and kept in the freezer. Bring them out and warm them up for a festive morning treat.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners, and set aside.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and white sugar, mixing until thoroughly blended.\nIn another bowl, whisk together the egg, 1 cup of apple cider, and vegetable oil. Stir in the apple and mincemeat. Pour the mincemeat mixture into the flour mixture, and stir until just combined.\nFill the lined muffin cups 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until the muffins are risen and browned, and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes.\nMake a glaze by stirring together the confectioners' sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and about 1 tablespoon of apple cider, or a little more as needed to make the glaze workable. Spread the glaze on the warm muffins.",
