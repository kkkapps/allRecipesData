Bring the mixture to a simmer, then add the chicken. Continue to simmer until chicken is tender and pulls from the bone easily, about 30 minutes.\nWhen chicken is cooked through, remove it from the pot and tear the meat off of the bones into bite sized pieces. Discard bones and return the chicken to the pot and heat through. Serve hot over rice.",
