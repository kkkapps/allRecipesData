    "des": "\"A different version of the commonly seen appetizer of scallops wrapped in bacon.  Using prosciutto allows for the subtle flavors of this meat to come through without overpowering the wonderful flavor of the scallops.  Additionally, the fat content and grease is significantly less than bacon for those that are health conscious.  I serve this for guests as an appetizer and people love it.  It can be made into a main course dish by increase the portion for each person.\"",
    "ins": "Wrap each scallop with a thin slice of prosciutto and secure with a toothpick.\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the scallops into the pan, and cook for about 2 minutes on each side. Season each side with pepper as it is cooking. Once each side has been fried, sprinkle the white wine over the scallops, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.\nRemove the scallops from the pan to drain on paper towels. When slightly cooled, transfer to a serving tray, and remove the toothpicks to serve.",
