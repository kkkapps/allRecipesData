    "ins": "Preheat broiler for high heat. Line a baking sheet with foil.\nMix the goat cheese with the basil in a bowl. Spread cheese mixture evenly on four slices of bread. Place on prepared baking sheet.\nCook under preheated broiler until cheese has begun to turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove and set aside.\nTo make the vinaigrette, whisk together the mustard and vinegar in a small bowl until blended; season with salt and pepper to taste. Slowly pour in olive oil while continually whisking until dressing is smooth.\nPlace diced beets and mixed greens into a large bowl.  Drizzle vinaigrette over top; toss to coat.  Divide salad onto four chilled plates.  Top with avocado and hazelnuts.  Serve with goat-cheese tartines.",
