    "des": "\"This is a yummy stew . . . you can omit the veggies, and just put it over rice or bread.   It is a snap to make, and very versatile!  You can use different vegetables, fresh or frozen.  I don't recommend canned, because they will turn to mush.\"",
    "ins": "Cut meat into bite-sized pieces.  Mix with onions, and toss mixture with 1/3 cup flour.  Heat oil in a large saucepan, and cook over medium low heat until browned.\nPlace browned meat and bouillon cubes into crock pot.  Add water until meat is covered with 1 inch liquid.  Cover. Slow cook on high for about 5 hours. This should be long enough to make meat very tender.\nTo thicken up the gravy, mix 1/2 cup flour with 1 cup hot water until flour is dissolved.  Pour into crock pot, and stir.  Repeat if not thick enough.  If you are not using veggies, the stew is ready to pour over the rice now.  If you are going to use veggies, add them now.  Cook until vegetables are tender.",
