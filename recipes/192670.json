    "des": "\"This is a recipe for beautiful, sweet, and slightly tangy roasted Bosc pears. They are delicious with just some whipped cream or ice cream and they are also perfect on tarts and cheesecakes.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a baking sheet.\nArrange the pear quarters on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle all but 1 tablespoon of the honey over the pears; set the reserved honey aside.\nStir the fig preserves, pomegranate molasses, and cinnamon together in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and keep at a simmer until ready to use.\nBake the pears in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Brush the fig glaze over the baked pears. Continue baking until firm on the outside, but tender inside, 25 to 35 minutes more. Allow to cool 5 minutes.\nWhile the pears cool, whip the cream, almond extract, and reserved honey together with a hand mixer in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until thick. Dollop the whipped cream mixture over the pears to serve.",
