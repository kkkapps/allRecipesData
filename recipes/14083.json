    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nCut acorn squash in half. Roast them cut side up on a baking sheet for 50 minutes or until the flesh is just tender. Let the squash cool for 20 minutes.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat melt the butter; saute the onions. Stirring occasionally, cook the onions for 10 minutes, or until they begin to brown at the edges. Mix in the garlic, coriander, and nutmeg. Cook the mixture 2 minutes more; then remove the pan from the heat.\nSpoon the seeds and stringy middle out of the squash, and discard these. Spoon out the flesh, chop it and add it to the onion mixture. Discard the skins. Heat and stir the squash-onion mixture, then season it with salt and pepper. Serve the squash hot.",
