Whisk until all ingredients are thoroughly combined. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Pour mixture into baked pie shell.\nIn a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and vanilla, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pie, covering completely.\nBake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until top is lightly browned. Remove and allow to cool before serving.",
