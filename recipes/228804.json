    "des": "\"These salmon croquette patties are great with or without buns. As a kid I remember watching my mother make these. I have altered it quite a bit to make it my own. My husband and his family loves them so I decided to share. Jalapeno can be added to the sauce for those who choose. This option works well for guest who can not eat spicy foods.\"",
