    "des": "\"This recipe replaces the butter on traditional garlic bread with cream cheese, making it creamy and delicious! The blue cheese adds a sophisticated flair and pairs especially well with a nice grilled steak and green salad. This bread cooks up crisp on the outside while the topping keeps the inside moist and soft.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place bread halves on a baking sheet.\nMix cream cheese and garlic together in a bowl. Spread over the bread in a thin layer. Sprinkle Italian cheese, Gorgonzola cheese, and Italian seasoning evenly over the 2 halves.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.\nTurn on the broiler. Broil garlic bread until crisped and top is bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes.\nLet cool for about 5 minutes before cutting garlic bread into individual slices.",
