    "des": "\"This tabouli recipe is different. Instead of using bulgur like traditional tabouli, this recipe uses quinoa. It is a grain that is available at health food stores. It looks and tastes better than bulgur. My husband and I both love this and neither of us is vegetarian. It's a great meal for a hot summer day. The longer it sits the better it tastes.\"",
    "ins": "In a saucepan bring water to a boil.  Add quinoa and a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.  Allow to cool to room temperature; fluff with a fork.\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, combine olive oil, sea salt, lemon juice, tomatoes, cucumber, green onions, carrots and parsley.  Stir in cooled quinoa.",
