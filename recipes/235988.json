    "des": "\"I've tried several variations of this recipe and this is by far my favorite. The creaminess of the cheese soup, the pungent flavor of the lobster, and smokiness of the bacon blend together in a lovely dish you can serve on a busy weeknight or at your next dinner party.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.\nPlace bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and dice.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nStir Cheddar cheese soup, Cheddar cheese, and milk together in a bowl. Stir pasta, bacon, and lobster into soup mixture. Pour pasta mixture into a 2 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.\nMix bread crumbs and butter together in a separate bowl; sprinkle over pasta mixture.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbling and bread crumbs are lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.",
