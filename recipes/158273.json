    "des": "\"Scones are a kind of sweet biscuit. They are very common in the United Kingdom. Here is a pretty good recipe that I made after a lot of trial and error. These are quite easy. You can add a bit more sugar if you want. These taste awesome with grape or blackberry jelly!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.\nSift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter, cream, and milk; stir until a spongy dough has formed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface. Pat the dough into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick and 7 inches wide. Cut into 6 triangles. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 13 minutes.",
