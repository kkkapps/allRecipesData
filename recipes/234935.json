    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray 9x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray.\nPrepare mashed potatoes following package directions. Set aside.\nHeat oil in large saute pan over medium high heat. Add onions and cook until translucent, about 10 minutes.\nStir in garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper and cook until aromatic - about 1 minute.\nAdd ground turkey and cook until browned.\nStir in tomatoes with juice, green chiles, corn (drained if using canned), and olives. Heat through.\nPlace meat mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of mashed potatoes.\nBake for 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.\nGreat as it is, but also delicious served with a dollop of sour cream, salsa or hot sauce.",
