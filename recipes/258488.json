    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nMix brown sugar, honey, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a bowl to create the seasoning rub.\nSqueeze lime juice over the ribs; rub the seasoning mix on both sides. Place the ribs in a large roasting pan; you may need to cut ribs in half to fit. Distribute the pineapple chunks on top of ribs. Pour beer and reserved pineapple juice directly into the roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven until tender, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Let stand for 15 minutes.\nRemove pan from oven; let cool for 15 minutes before serving.",
