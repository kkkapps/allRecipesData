    "des": "\"There are few things as easy, healthy, and delicious as this ubiquitous dip. However, unless you're grinding your aromatic vegetation in a\u00c2\u00a0molcajete,\u00c2\u00a0or against a cutting board, you're really not tasting a classic guacamole.\u00c2\u00a0The flavors not only become more intense, but actually change in character. This is just what those bland, fatty, but delectable avocados need. That and a thoughtful seasoning of lime juice, and maybe some more salt.\"",
    "ins": "Place minced peppers, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, and the diced onions on a cutting board. Chop them together into very small pieces. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Using the flat side of the knife blade, smear the mixture to work it into a paste, and chop again to achieve as fine a texture as possible.\nStem, halve, and pit the avocados. Scoop out flesh and place in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, onion and serrano mixture, salt, and fresh lime juice. Mash with a potato masher to desired texture (smooth or chunky), 5 or 6 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. If not serving immediately, cover and refrigerate.",
