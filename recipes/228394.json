    "des": "\"This salad is a refreshing side to spicy Thai food. I prefer it without hot peppers or peanuts since its major purpose for me is refreshment. It's especially quick to make if you can slice the cucumbers and onions in a food processor.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk sugar, hot water, white vinegar, and salt in a bowl until sugar has dissolved. Stir cucumber and onion into the sauce. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to soften the texture of the vegetables and reduce pungency of the onion.",
