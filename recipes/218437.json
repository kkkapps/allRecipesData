    "des": "\"This dessert is best served warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. It is also delicious cooled to room temperature. Plan on making it when it will be eaten within 36 hours. The soft cake part can become stale afterward. I tend to make this for company or for a dish to pass event. Preparation time does not include time for pitting cherries.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\nIn a bowl, stir together the flour, 1 cup of sugar, baking powder, milk, and vegetable oil to make a smooth batter; scrape batter into the prepared baking dish.\nIn a separate bowl, stir the cherries with 1 cup of sugar and the almond extract; spoon the cherry mixture over the batter.\nBake in the preheated oven until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes.",
