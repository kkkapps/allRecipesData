    "des": "\"This is a recipe I made up when my husband requested a 'roast that tastes like Christmas.' It's a savory-sweet pork roast with cranberries, apples, and cloves. You can add ground cloves to the glaze instead of using whole cloves.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nPlace pork roast into a roasting pan; push whole cloves into the meat. Cover the roast with apple slices.\nMash cranberry sauce in a bowl with a potato masher; stir chicken broth, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger into cranberries. Pour about half the cranberry mixture over the pork roast. Cover with a lid or a sheet of aluminum foil.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Pour remaining cranberry mixture over roast. Sprinkle orange zest over the cranberry sauce.\nReturn to oven and roast until cranberry mixture forms a glaze and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meat reads at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), about 30 more minutes.",
