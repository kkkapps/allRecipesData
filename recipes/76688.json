    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the phyllo sheets on the counter, and cover with a damp cloth.\nPlace one sheet of phyllo dough on a flat surface, and brush lightly with melted butter. Fold in half lengthwise, and brush again. Spread about 1 tablespoon of peanut butter along the short end to cover about 2 inches. Fold the peanut butter section over twice, then spread a tablespoon of chocolate hazelnut spread in a two inch section. Continue folding until you reach the end. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat with remaining sheets of dough.\nBake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.",
