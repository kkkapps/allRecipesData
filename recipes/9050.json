    "des": "\"I love this recipe. So does my family. It will make several servings. This version is made with vermicelli, a pasta that is much thinner than regular spaghetti. 'Vermicelli' is Italian for 'little worms',  referring to the fact that it is shaped into very thin strands.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add chicken breasts and boil until cooked through and juices run clear. Remove chicken from pot, chop into bite size pieces and set aside.\nStrain remaining cooking broth, return to pot and bring to a boil. Break pasta in half (will make it easier to mix) and add to boiling broth. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and return pasta to pot.\nMeanwhile, saute onion and bell pepper in butter or margarine in a small saucepan. Add tomatoes with green chile peppers, sauteed onion/bell pepper mixture, peas and reserved chicken to pasta. Top with cheese and mix together well.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPour chicken mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes.",
