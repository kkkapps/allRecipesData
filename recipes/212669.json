    "des": "\"We do a lot of wild game hunting, and it's hard sometimes to get the gaminess out. This is a quick and easy recipe. I cook duck like red meat, so if you like eating your red meat well done, cook it a little longer.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2 quart glass baking dish with a lid.\nSpread about 1/4 cup of marmalade in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Set the duck breasts in the dish on the marmalade. Poke holes all over the breasts with a fork, and spread   a layer of marmalade (about 1 tablespoon for each) over the duck breasts. Sprinkle the garlic over the top of the duck meat. Spread the onion and orange slices around the duck breasts in the dish.\nCover the dish, and bake in the preheated oven until the duck breasts measure 100 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured with an instant-read meat thermometer, about 15 minutes. Remove the lid, spread about 1 more tablespoon of marmalade over each breast, and return to the oven, uncovered. Bake until the meat is medium rare (145 degrees F (63 degrees C).",
