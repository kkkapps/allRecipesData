    "ins": "Combine coleslaw mix, pepperoncini peppers, red onion, mayonnaise, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon granulated garlic, Dijon mustard, white sugar, salt, 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion, and lemon pepper in a large bowl. Toss until well combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.\nPreheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\nCombine kosher salt, black pepper, 2 tablespoons granulated garlic, 2 tablespoons granulated onion, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon together in a bowl.\nPlace pork shoulder in a large roasting pan. Rub with 1/4 cup molasses on all sides and between any crevices. Sprinkle with kosher salt seasoning mixture and rub over all sides.\nCover pan tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil and roast pork in the preheated oven until tender and a thermometer inserted reaches 200 degrees F (95 degrees C), 3 to 4 hours. Transfer pork to a cutting board, reserving pan juice, and allow to cool slightly before pulling. Using two forks, shred the pork shoulder into bite-size pieces. Transfer meat to a large bowl and toss with some of the pan juices to keep it moist.\nPour reserved pan juices into a large pot over medium heat. Add barbeque sauce, coffee, 1 tablespoon molasses, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, dry mustard, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook for 15 minutes. Add shredded pork and stir until warm, about 5 minutes.\nFill each hoagie bun with pork mixture. Top with 1 to 2 cups coleslaw. Garnish with 1 tablespoon onion and 1 tablespoon jalapeno.",
