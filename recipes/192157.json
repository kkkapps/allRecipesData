    "des": "\"My grandmother used to make Jumbutt when we were young (I am sure I spelled it wrong). It is so easy, the amounts are very flexible and you can make a lot of substitutions based on taste -- pretty much goof-proof. We used hot dogs instead of sausage when we were kids. You can also use kielbasa.\"",
    "ins": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the sausage until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet, drain off the excess fat, and set aside.\nPlace the potatoes, green peppers, and red peppers into the skillet, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are browned and the peppers are softened, about 15 minutes. Return the sausage to the skillet, and pour the eggs over the top. Cook and stir 3 to 5 minutes until the eggs are set, and serve.",
