    "des": "\"This has long been my go-to recipe for Easter brunch, potluck lunches, bridal and baby showers, or really, anytime we want a delicious chicken salad. It can be made a day ahead. The unique combination of the fresh ginger and green grapes always draw raves. I serve mine with a basket of fresh croissants that my guests can then make into chicken salad sandwiches, if they choose. There are never any leftovers!\"",
