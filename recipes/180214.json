    "des": "\"This recipe is sweet and creamy. It uses the entire beet. It's pink color is a bonus. A glass of Chardonnay goes perfectly with this dish.\"",
    "ins": "Place the beet and greens in a blender or food processor and pulse until finely chopped.\nBring the water and broth to a simmer in a large pot over medium-low heat.\nHeat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion in the oil until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the rice; cook and stir another 2 minutes. Mix in the beet and beet green mixture, cooking another minute. Pour in the broth mixture 1 cup at a time, allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding each batch, stirring continually; reduce heat to medium and simmer 20 minutes. Stir in the Cheddar cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Continue stirring until creamy and thick, about 3 minutes more. Serve with Parmesan cheese.",
