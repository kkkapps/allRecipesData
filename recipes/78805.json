Scoop out the pulp and seeds, and place the tomatoes on a platter lined with paper towels to drain. Refrigerate until needed.\nCombine the softened cream cheese, smoked salmon, cream, lemon juice, and black pepper, and beat with a hand mixer until filling is soft and well-blended. Scoop the mixture into the barrel of a cookie press or into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Squeeze a small amount of the salmon filling into each cherry tomato.",
