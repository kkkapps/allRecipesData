    "des": "\"This chocolate dough can be rolled out like a fondant, or molded to form roses, leaves or whatever. It's very simple to make, and quite impressive. This can also be made with white chocolate.\"",
    "ins": "Melt chocolate in a large metal bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in the corn syrup. The mixture will become sticky, but keep stirring until very well blended.\nSpoon onto a piece of plastic wrap, and wrap tightly. Let stand at room temperature until firm before using. Overnight is best. Use unsweetened cocoa powder on work surfaces to prevent sticking.",
