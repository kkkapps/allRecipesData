    "des": "\"Brie cheese melted on grilled ground beef sliders is a reminder how classy these casual mini burgers can be. Dijon-style mustard, pepper, and VOSKOS\u00c2\u00ae Nonfat Blueberry Greek Yogurt turn them juicy and aromatic. Don't forget to toast the bun.\"",
    "ins": "Combine bread crumbs, VOSKOS(R) Nonfat Blueberry Greek Yogurt, mustard, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add ground beef, mix well. Shape mixture into twelve small patties.\nFor charcoal grill, place patties on the grill rack directly over medium coals; cover and grill for 8 to 10 minutes or until done (160 degrees F), turning once halfway through grilling and topping each burger with cheese the last minute of grilling time. (For gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Place patties on grill rack over heat. Cover and grill as above.) Serve patties on buns with sliced onion.",
