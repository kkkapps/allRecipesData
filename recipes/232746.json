    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large casserole dish.\nHeat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, feta cheese, black pepper, onion salt, garlic powder, basil, oregano, parsley, and thyme into ground beef. Simmer until flavors blend, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour ground beef mixture over cavatappi.\nBake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.",
