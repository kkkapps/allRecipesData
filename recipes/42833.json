    "ins": "Toss chopped pears with sugar, ginger, and cloves in a large bowl. Set aside and let the sugar dissolve in the pear juices.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan.\nStir vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and eggs into the pears. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the pear mixture and stir gently just to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.",
