    "des": "\"If you're looking for a green chile chicken enchilada casserole with a kick, this might be the one for you. I found the base recipe scouring the web for something that would taste like my ex-mom-in-law's casserole, which was to-die-for, and I've tweaked it a few times to make it my own. Try throwing in some jalapenos for even more kick.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nHeat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute green chile peppers, onion, bell pepper, corn, black beans, and garlic until onion and bell pepper are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.\nStir chicken, 1/2 cup enchilada sauce, and black pepper into vegetable mixture.\nSpread 1/4 cup enchilada sauce in the bottom of an 11x17-inch casserole dish.\nLightly coat 1 side of 18 tortilla quarters with sour cream and arrange, sour cream-side up, in the casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture over tortilla layer.\nStir green chile salsa into the remaining chicken mixture.\nSprinkle 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend over chicken mixture layer in the casserole dish; top with 10 tortilla quarters. Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce over tortilla layer and cover with chicken-salsa mixture; add 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend.\nLightly coat 14 tortilla quarters with sour cream and arrange, sour cream-side down, over the cheese layer. Spread 1 cup enchilada sauce over tortillas and top with remaining cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.",
