Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended, then beat in the vanilla with the last egg.\nMix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; add to the butter mixture and stir until just incorporated into a batter. Fold chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and pecans into the batter; spread into the prepared baking dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 25 to 30 minutes.
