    "des": "\"Meatball subs in soggy, falling-apart buns are just the worst. That's why we recommend toasting our Tailgaters Brat Buns for this recipe. The heftier, toasty bread will stand up to all that meaty, marinara, mozzarella goodness.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.\nToast one bun until golden brown, then place in blender and chop until fine to create crumbs.\nPlace the bread crumbs in a large bowl and add milk. Let soak for 5 minutes.\nAdd ground beef, eggs, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt and pepper to the bread crumb mixture and combine well.\nDivide the mixture into 16 golf ball-sized meatballs, and place on an oiled baking pan.\nBake meatballs in oven for 10 minutes.\nWhile meatballs are baking, heat marinara in a large pot over medium-high heat. Place the cooked meatballs in the marinara and simmer for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, toast the remaining buns, then evenly distribute arugula or spinach, meatballs and mozzarella onto each bun.\nGarnish with chopped basil and/or crushed red pepper and serve.",
