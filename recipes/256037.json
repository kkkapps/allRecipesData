    "des": "\"This is my version of the green sauce found in Peruvian restaurants, spiced up even more with ghost peppers. For a more tame sauce, omit the ghost peppers. This is mouth burning, but addictive. It's great on Peruvian chicken, burritos,  salads, or as a veggie dip.\"",
    "ins": "Combine cilantro, ghost chile peppers, jalapeno peppers, sour cream, mayonnaise, lime juice, and garlic in a food processor; process until sauce is smooth.\nTaste sauce and season with salt and pepper. Add olive oil and blend until smooth and creamy.",
