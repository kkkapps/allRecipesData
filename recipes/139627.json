    "des": "\"Good ole red beans and rice with lots of smoked sausage. I put lots of garlic in it which makes it tasty. I take it to my bingo crowd and they love it!  Normally I don't measure, so I decided to write it down while I was making it. This is medium on the heat but make it hot as you like!\"",
    "ins": "In a 6 quart or larger slow cooker, combine the smoked sausage, kidney  beans, onion, garlic, rice and water. Season with Cajun seasoning, hot pepper sauce, salt and bay leaf. Cover and set on High. Once it gets heated through, stir to distribute everything evenly. Cover and cook on Low for 6 hours or on High for 4 hours.",
