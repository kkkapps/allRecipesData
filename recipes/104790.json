    "des": "\"I created this recipe after visiting a local Mexican restaurant I frequent and I picked through the dish to discover the ingredients. I decided I could do a reasonable rendition that would rival the one I ate. I succeeded and people rave about my salsa and always ask me to make some. I got to know the owners and consequently gave them a sample and they said was good and very close to their recipe. Since that time I have made several batches modifying this that and the other. Play with the recipe for a taste treat. Vary the ingredients for a taste treat.\"",
