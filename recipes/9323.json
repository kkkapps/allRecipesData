    "des": "\"The perfect way to use up all the leftovers from Holiday Feasts.  You can substitute any meat for the turkey.  I have used beef as well, and it makes a wonderfully tasty dish that doesn't remind you that this is the 4th time you have eaten Christmas dinner. Turkey stock can be used in place of turkey gravy.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nIf you are using stock, bring the stock to a boil.  Add cornstarch to cold water, and blend until smooth; whisk into stock to thicken.\nLine a 9 inch pie plate with pastry.  Mix turkey and vegetables together, and place in pie crust.  Pour gravy or thickened stock over turkey and vegetables.  Cover with remaining pie crust.  Cut slits in the top to release steam.\nPlace pot pie on a cookie sheet to prevent stock from over flowing into your oven.  Cook in center of oven until crust is golden brown, approximately 1 hour.  Slice, and serve hot.",
