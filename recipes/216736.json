    "des": "\"I love cooking country ribs in my slow cooker -- such a cheap cut of meat to have so much flavor! Although the ol' bottle of BBQ sauce is delicious, it is very sweet and rich. Enter the spirit of adventure and use some random pantry items to create a delicious, lighter alternative.\"",
    "ins": "Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over high heat. Brown the ribs evenly in the hot oil, about 5 minutes; remove from heat.\nStir the tomato sauce, dried onion, hoisin sauce, and shiitake mushrooms together in a slow cooker. Add the ribs to the sauce mixture, turning to coat in the sauce.\nCook on Low until the ribs are falling-apart tender, 8 to 10 hours.",
