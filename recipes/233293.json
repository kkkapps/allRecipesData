    "des": "\"Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Feel free to experiment with this original recipe by me. Yummy sauteed meat, potatoes, veggies, with eggs. Ingredient measures are approximate. I had to guess how much I used as I put things in as I went. Love an ingredient, ADD MORE! Don't like one much, ADD LESS! Very versatile recipe.\"",

Beat eggs and milk in a bowl.\nMelt butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir potatoes, ham, onion, and garlic in melted butter until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Add water if vegetables become dry. Season with salt and pepper.\nPour egg mixture over vegetable mixture. Cook, without stirring, until eggs are slightly browned on the bottom.\nBroil in the preheated oven until eggs are nearly set, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over eggs and continue broiling until frittata is completely set and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.",
