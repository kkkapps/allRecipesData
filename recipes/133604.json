    "ins": "Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, celery, and green pepper; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and rice; season with basil, garlic, pepper, hot sauce, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then turn heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is done, about 20 minutes.\nOnce the rice has cooked, stir in chicken, sausage, and shrimp. Simmer for a few minutes until heated through. Remove bay leaf before serving.",
