    "des": "\"Years ago a friend gave me her black-eyed pea recipe that was not your usual black-eyed peas. She called them Cottoneyed Peas. It was a spicy and warm welcome into the New Year. I now get requests for it all the time. You can make it as spicy as you like or, if you don't like spicy, use the peas without jalapeno.\"",
    "ins": "Brown the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy; drain, crumble, and set aside.\nIn a large saucepan, combine the canned black-eyed peas, canned tomatoes, onion, celery, garlic,  and jalapeno peppers. Cook over medium heat until the celery and onion are tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add crumbled bacon before serving.",
