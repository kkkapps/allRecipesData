    "des": "\"My favorite answer to using the beets from our weekly vegetable delivery. I have used both a spiralizer (Paderno\u00c2\u00ae brand) and an ordinary shredder. I have been creative and used leftover chicken, added saut\u00c3\u00a9ed kale, garlic-roasted broccoli, and any other number of vegetables I had on hand. Other delightful garnishes are chopped peanuts, shredded purple cabbage, shredded carrot, and/or bean sprouts. This is a flexible recipe that will welcome what you have on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nWrap beets loosely with aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet.\nRoast in the preheated oven until tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes. Peel off skin and shred beets.\nBring a large pot of water to boil. Remove from heat; add rice noodles. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add eggs; cook and stir until scrambled, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Add shrimp; cook and stir until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour over eggs in the bowl.\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil in the wok over high heat. Add cabbage and onion; saute until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to the bowl. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil, ginger, and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in rice vinegar, peanut butter, tamarind sauce, and tamari sauce.\nStir beets, noodles, scrambled eggs, shrimp, cabbage, and onion into the wok; toss carefully until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a large serving bowl. Garnish with cilantro, chives, and lime wedges.",
