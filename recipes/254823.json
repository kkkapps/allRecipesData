    "ins": "Place cauliflower florets in a food processor; pulse into rice-sized pieces.\nCombine cauliflower \"rice\", black beans, cilantro, green onions, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, lime juice, salt, and pepper in a microwave-safe bowl; toss until mixed. Top with Cheddar cheese.\nPuree chipotle peppers in adobo in a small bowl with an immersion blender.\nHeat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini in an even layer; place kale on top. Cook, covered, until zucchini is lightly browned and kale starts to wilt, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 to 3 tablespoons pureed chipotle peppers. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, allowing kale to steam, 3 to 5 minutes.\nFill a saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add eggs, and simmer, about 7 minutes. Remove eggs with a slotted spoon and run under cool water for 30 to 60 seconds. Peel carefully.\nSpoon zucchini mixture over Cheddar cheese in the bowl. Microwave until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Top with peeled eggs and sliced avocado. Season with salt and pepper.",
