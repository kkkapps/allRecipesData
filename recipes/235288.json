    "des": "\"This will make an excellent desert for the holidays. Give them cranberries in a whole new way. I don't know how anyone can't love this dish.\n \nI was going make a Martha Stewart Cherry Clafouti, but the grocery store was out of cherries. I also needed cherry liquor, but the liquor store was closed. I did have cranberries and Grand Marnier which sounded really good. I was right on the money. It's fantastic, probably better than the cherry version. The cranberries add a nice tartness to the dish. I hope you like it.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish.\nSpread cranberries out in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish.\nWhisk milk, cream, eggs, and egg yolks together in a bowl; add white sugar, orange liqueur, vanilla, and salt. Gradually add flour, whisking constantly. Pour egg mixture through a sieve over cranberries in casserole dish.\nBake in the preheated oven until cranberries are set and clafouti is set, about 45 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar.",
