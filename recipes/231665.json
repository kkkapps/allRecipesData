    "ins": "Season chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.\nHeat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook chicken in the melted butter until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from skillet.\nCook and stir onion and mushrooms in the same skillet; add olive oil. Cook until onion and mushrooms are slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour sherry and chicken broth into the skillet, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, about 2 minutes.\nReturn chicken to the skillet, cover, and simmer chicken and onion mixture until liquid is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes. Spoon onion and mushrooms atop each chicken breast and top each with a slice of provolone cheese. Remove skillet from heat; cover skillet until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.",
