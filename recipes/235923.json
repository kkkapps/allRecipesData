    "des": "\"Simple, healthy slow cooker pork roast recipe born from my love of sweetness and lack of ingredients. The dish works great even for singles or smaller families because the leftovers are great. Don't throw out the juice! Save all the juice with the leftovers and include it when reheating; it will keep the meat moist and delicious.\"",
