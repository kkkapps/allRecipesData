Using a small spoon, carefully scoop out the pulp to make a hollow, yet sturdy, shell. Drain off any juice that may be in the tomato shells.\nUsing a small spoon, scoop about 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixture and carefully stuff into a tomato shell. Repeat until tomatoes or cheese mixture is used up. Arrange the filled tomatoes on a platter to serve.",
