    "des": "\"I made this for Easter and got a family request to make it again for Mother's Day. These amounts are for the family, so it makes quite a bit. The time took longer for me because of the amount of shrimp I had to peel, but if you cut this recipe down, it won't take you so long. This time I also included crawfish. Oh ya'll gotta try it! Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl.\nHeat olive oil in a large pot over low heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.\nMix parsley, sage, basil, and lemon zest in a bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.\nPour 1 cup seafood stock in a measuring cup and set aside; pour remaining stock and lemon juice into onion mixture. Stir in thyme, cilantro, dill, sea salt, and black pepper; cook until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Add crawfish to seasoned stock mixture; cook until crawfish are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.\nStir shrimp into crawfish mixture; cook until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Remove crawfish and shrimp from sauce using a slotting spoon; transfer to a bowl and cover.\nWhisk cornstarch into reserved 1 cup seafood stock until completely dissolved; stir into sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, at a simmer until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes.\nMix half-and-half and Creole seasoning into sauce until fully incorporated and warmed; add crawfish and shrimp back into sauce.
