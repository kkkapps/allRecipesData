    "des": "\"These not-too-sweet cookies are a little crispy around the edges and soft inside, studded with chocolate chips - sometimes with dried cranberries or currants. My husband and son usually eat them all in an afternoon. Great for kids' lunches, or a healthy accompaniment to an afternoon cup of tea. These cookies can be adapted to your family's taste in a variety of ways. Sometimes I will replace vanilla with almond extract, add in coconut flakes, nuts and/or dried fruit for a different flavor profile.\"",
