    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).\nSimmer orange juice and mango in a small pan over medium-low heat for 8 minutes. Set aside.  Beat the butter, shortening, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time.  Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the macadamia nuts, coconut, cranberries, and mango; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto greased baking sheets.\nBake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.",
