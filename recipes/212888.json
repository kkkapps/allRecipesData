    "des": "\"A friend gave me this easy candy recipe, and now I make it every Christmas. The mixtures of different chocolates make for a great milk chocolate flavor. The best part is it's made in the slow cooker. Just put in your ingredients and let your cooker do the hard work.  These little candies make a great gift-giving idea.\"",
    "ins": "Place the white candy coating, German sweet chocolate, chocolate chips, and peanuts into a slow cooker. Set the cooker to Low, cover, and gently heat the candy for 1 1/2 hours without stirring. After 1 1/2 hours, stir the mixture, and spoon out by teaspoons onto waxed paper. Allow to cool and set, about 45 minutes.",
