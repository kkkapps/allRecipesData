    "ins": "Measure flour into a very large bowl. Mix in shortening by breaking into smaller and smaller pieces using your hands or a pastry blender until lumps are no larger than peas. Gradually stir in the lemon-lime soda so that the mixture is evenly moistened.\nForm into baseball sized balls and pat flat. Store each flattened ball in a small resealable sandwich bag, then put those bags into a larger sized freezer bag. Freeze until needed.",
