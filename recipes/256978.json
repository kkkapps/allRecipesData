    "des": "\"A true Irish dish which has been enjoyed for many a year by all Dubliners, soon to be enjoyed by your family over and over again! This is the bare bones traditional recipe but feel free to add garlic, a bay leaf, or other fresh herbs for flavor. It's also good if you replace the water with cider.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving grease in the skillet. Slice into big chunky pieces and transfer to a large pot.\nCook sausages, turning occasionally, in the bacon grease until browned, about 5 minutes; add to the large pot. Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the pot.\nArrange potatoes over onion. Pour in enough water to cover the potatoes. Cover the pot; bring water to a boil. Reduce heat to very low; simmer until potatoes are tender, 1 to 1 hour 30 minutes. Garnish with parsley.",
