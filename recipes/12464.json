    "des": "\"A sweet shortbread-type pie crust. Goes well with fruit pies.\"",
    "ins": "Place flour in a bowl with the sugar and salt.  Cut the butter and shortening into pieces, and cut into the flour until crumbly.  Mix in vanilla.  Add just enough water to form a ball: it should not be sticky.  Knead quickly into a smooth ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for 1 hour.\nWhen ready to make pie, roll dough out as you would any crust.  Do not let sit out, or handle excessively allowing to soften.  Easiest to work with if firm.",
