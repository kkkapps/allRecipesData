    "des": "\"I recently made a meat and cheese board for my family and wanted to make a jam/preserve with it that we normally wouldn't have. Figs came to mind and, after searching around a little and getting a few ideas, I came up with this. It was such a huge hit that I decided to share it. I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as we did! It will last for up to 30 days if you do not can it.\"",
    "ins": "Combine figs, honey, water, butter, lemon juice, cinnamon, vanilla extract, cloves, salt, and ginger in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until figs are soft, about 1 hour 15 minutes.\nBlend figs with an immersion blender until mixture reaches desired consistency. Stir in walnuts. Cook until flavors combine, about 15 minutes.\nRemove pot from heat and pour fig mixture into a container; transfer to the refrigerator.",
