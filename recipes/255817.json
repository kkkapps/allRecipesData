    "des": "\"A creamy and tangy lemon curd with a background of coconut flavor. It's easy to make but requires a lot of constant whisking; it's worth it in the end! Serve on top of cake or perhaps sweet biscuits.\"",
    "ins": "Fill a saucepan with enough water to come about 1 inch up the side. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.\nCombine eggs, coconut oil, sugar, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl. Set the bowl on top of the saucepan so it is over, but not touching, the simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until curd is smooth and the consistency of pudding, 6 to 8 minutes.\nRemove bowl from the saucepan and continue whisking curd until slightly cooled, 2 to 3 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold and slightly thickened, about 1 hour.",
