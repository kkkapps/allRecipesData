Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\nTop each slice of bread with one slice of provolone and one slice of Swiss cheese; place on a cookie sheet. Broil on top oven rack until the cheese browns and the edges of the bread are crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.\nTo serve, ladle soup into 3 bowls and top with one slice of the cheese-topped bread.",
