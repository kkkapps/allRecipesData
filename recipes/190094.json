    "des": "\"This Sea Bass will melt in your mouth!  Delicious, I had this at Blue Water Grill in NYC and it was by far the best sea bass I've ever had in my life.  This recipe is as close as I can get to tasting like the restaurants.  They served it with bok choy and sticky rice on the side.\"",
    "ins": "Whisk together the sake, mirin, soy sauce, brown sugar, and miso paste in a bowl to make the marinade. Place the sea bass in a large sealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over the sea bass. Chill in refrigerator 3 to 6 hours. Arrange the fillets on a baking sheet. Discard the marinade.\nPreheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Prop the oven door to remain slightly ajar.\nBake the sea bass under the broiler until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes.  Sprinkle with chopped green onions to serve.",
