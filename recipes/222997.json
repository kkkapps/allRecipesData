    "des": "\"Beautiful summer dessert using fresh berries and a splash of pear liqueur. Enjoy a la carte or a la mode.  Exceptionally lovely on the Fourth of July. Serve berries by themselves or over vanilla gelato, with a small amount of excess liquid - but it should not be a berry soup.\"",
    "ins": "Combine sugar with water in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes; remove from heat and let stand 5 more minutes.\nStir pear liqueur into the syrup and refrigerate for 1 hour.\nGently combine strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries in a large bowl and pour syrup over the berries to coat. Allow berries to stand for about 3 hours to absorb flavors. Mixture can stand up to 3 days if desired.",
