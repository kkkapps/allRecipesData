Heat in the microwave until ingredients are soft enough to stir together, about 1 minute. Stir in the shredded cheese, diced tomatoes with chilies, spinach and taco seasoning mix. Spread evenly.\nBake uncovered in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle tomatoes and green onions on top before serving. This can also be made ahead of time, refrigerated, and baked just before serving.",
