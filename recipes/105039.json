    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nStir together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.  Combine the oil and soy milk in a measuring cup. Pour into the dry ingredients all at once, and stir just until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto a baking sheet.\nBake for 8 to10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the biscuits are browned on the top and bottom.",
