    "des": "\"This tangy, sweet brisket recipe makes a wonderful main dish, or a fabulous appetizer when paired with crackers or bread rounds. It's been a favorite with my husband's family for years. This recipe can also be prepared in a slow cooker.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place brisket in 9x13 inch pan.\nIn a medium bowl, combine dressing, soup mix, and cranberries.  Pour over brisket, and cover pan with foil.\nCook for 3 to 4 hours, or until brisket is extremely tender.  Brisket will get very dark/caramelized; this adds flavor, and doesn't mean that you have overcooked it.",
