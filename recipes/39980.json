Layer the coated mushroom slices into a 2 quart casserole dish. Pour in any remaining dressing (or even more if you like), and sprinkle with any remaining breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the top.\nBake, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.",
