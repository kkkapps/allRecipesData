    "ins": "In a small bowl, combine the garlic, parsley, and 2 tablespoons olive oil.\nRinse hens and pat dry. Rub remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil on the inside and outside of the hens. Stuff the garlic and parsley mixture under skin and around each bird.  Season with salt and pepper. Place seasoned hens in an airtight, plastic container.  Sprinkle with rosemary, and pour wine over birds. Cover, and refrigerate at least overnight to marinate.\nPreheat grill for low heat.\nRemove hens from marinade, and place on heated grill.  Cook for 40 minutes, turning  once, or until done.",
