Prick lightly with fork.\nIn a medium bowl; mix crabmeat, bechamel sauce, shallots, and tarragon until well blended.\nCut prawns lengthwise and open them up to form a butterfly shape. Lay one shrimp in the middle of each pastry square with open side facing up. Stuff each shrimp with an equal amount of spinach and top with a heaping tablespoon of the crab mixture. Fold over pastry to make a triangle, and press the edges to seal. Place on the baking sheet, and brush with beaten egg.\nBake in preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm.",
