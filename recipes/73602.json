    "des": "\"A great recipe that you can make ahead and marinate overnight. If you like your barbecue ribs a little on the spicy side, you will love these ribs! Great with potato salad and baked beans.\"",
    "ins": "Place the ribs in large pot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Stir in the lemon juice. Cook the ribs 1 hour, until meat is tender. Drain, and place in large resealable plastic bags.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix the picante sauce, brown sugar, barbeque sauce, garlic, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, jalapeno peppers, and onion. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Pour over the ribs in the plastic bags. Seal bags, and marinate ribs 8 hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator.\nPreheat the grill for high heat.\nLightly oil the grill grate. Place ribs on the grill, and discard remaining marinade. Season ribs with red pepper flakes, and cook 10 to 20 minutes, turning once, until browned and crisp.",
