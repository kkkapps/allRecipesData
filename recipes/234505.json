Remove saucepan from heat and let soup cool.\nPour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed soup to the saucepan.\nPlace saucepan over low heat; warm soup, stirring occasionally, until hot, about 5 minutes. Garnish servings with lime wedges, cilantro, and sour cream.",
