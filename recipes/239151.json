    "ins": "Arrange chicken breasts into a baking dish; add tequila and lime juice. Sprinkle half the lime zest, half the garlic powder, and half the chili powder over the chicken. Cover dish with plastic wrap and marinate in refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nTurn chicken breasts; sprinkle remaining lime juice, garlic powder, and chili powder over the chicken breasts. Cover again and marinate in refrigerator for another 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove and discard plastic wrap.\nBake chicken in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Raise chicken out of the marinade onto a roasting rack, sprinkle cheese over the chicken, and continue to bake until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
