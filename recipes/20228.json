    "des": "\"Yummy little tidbits, a cookie that is dark, lightly sweet, and not heavy tasting. Very yummy!!!  I got this recipe from a dear friend back when we graduated from high school and it has become a family favorite. For variety, add chocolate chips or candied fruit.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Sift together the flour, salt and baking soda, set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Stir in the sifted ingredients until well blended. Roll dough in to 3/4 inch balls or tiny crescents. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.",
