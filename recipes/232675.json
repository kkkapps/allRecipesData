    "des": "\"Preparing this recipe is literally the first thing I do after I wake up on weekend mornings. I put the bacon in the oven (must be cold!), brush my teeth, start cooking other breakfast items, and then take the bacon out after 14 minutes - that's it! My bacon theory is that by placing the bacon in a cold oven to start, as the oven gradually heats to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), the bacon undergoes a magical transformation from cold flabby piece of meat, to simmering deliciousness, to crispy bacon heaven as the oven hits the 425 degree mark. Enjoy!\"",
    "ins": "Line a large baking sheet with 2 sheets of aluminum foil, making sure pan is completely covered.\nArrange bacon strips on the prepared baking sheet, keeping at least 1/2-inch space between strips. Place pan in the cold oven.\nHeat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cook bacon for 14 minutes.\nTransfer cooked bacon to paper towel-lined plates. Let cool for 5 minutes for bacon to crisp.",
