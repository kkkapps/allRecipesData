    "des": "\"An authentic Greek entree that is easy to make and makes you feel like you are in the Greek islands. My sister and I originally ate this dish at a restaurant in Santorini, Greece and went back 3 days in a row to order it again and analyze the ingredients so we could replicate it at home. It is easy to prepare ahead of time and stick in the oven so your cooking is complete before guests arrive! Serve over rice.\"",
    "ins": "Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, chopped parsley, tomatoes, and wine. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has slightly thickened.\nPreheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\nStir the shrimp into the tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes; remove from the heat. Pour the shrimp mixture into a shallow baking dish, and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the feta has softened and the shrimp are no longer translucent, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Squeeze the lemon halves over the shrimp and garnish with the parsley sprigs to serve.",
