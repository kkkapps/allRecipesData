    "des": "\"Easy pork chops for any night! Grilled pork chops and onions, marinated in GOYA\u00c2\u00ae Mojo Chipotle, are moist and tender with a zesty, smoky-spicy flavor. These easy pork chops are best when they soak up the marinade overnight, so that, the next day, you can enjoy their juicy flavor in minutes. We're sure you'll give our grilled pork chops high marks for ease and flavor!\"",
    "ins": "In a zip-top bag* or a large container with a lid, combine the pork, onions and 1 cup Mojo. Seal bag and transfer to refrigerator; chill at least 3 hours, or overnight.\nPrepare a grill to medium-high heat, or heat a large, lightly-greased grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove pork and onions from the marinade; discard any leftover liquid. Season pork with Adobo. Cook pork until golden brown and internal temperature registers 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) on a quick-read thermometer, basting with remaining mojo, flipping once, 15 to 20 minutes. Cook onions until soft and golden brown, about 10 minutes.\nDivide pork and onions evenly among serving dishes.",
