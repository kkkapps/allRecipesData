    "ins": "Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper; cook in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove pork chops to a plate.\nReduce heat to medium; cook and stir the garlic in the skillet just until fragrant, 10 to 20 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce, red wine vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, and cloves; bring to a boil. Stir the mixture until the brown sugar dissolves; add the plums. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer the mixture until the sauce has thickened and the plums are very soft, about 45 minutes. Mash the plums with a potato masher to an applesauce-like texture. Place the pork chops back into the pan and cook in the sauce until no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes. A meat thermometer inserted into the middle of a chop should read 145 degrees (63 degrees C).",
