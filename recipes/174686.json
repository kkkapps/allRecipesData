    "des": "\"I came across this Huckleberry Cake recipe a few years ago and changed it a little. The cake is wonderful even without the topping! Garnish with sliced almonds and serve with a dollop of whipped cream.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Mix together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.\nCombine the egg, vanilla, 1/2 cup melted butter, buttermilk, and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar in a bowl. Add the flour mixture and stir until combined. Gently fold in the huckleberries. Pour batter into prepared pan.\nTo make the topping, combine 1/2 cup brown sugar, the white sugar, oats, and cinnamon. Toss with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the cake batter.\nBake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool completely before serving. Serve garnished with whipped cream and sliced almonds, if desired.",
