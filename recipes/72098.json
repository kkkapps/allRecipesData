    "des": "\"A Bierox is a German hamburger. Bread dough is filled with ground beef, cabbage and seasonings to make a tasty alternative to the American hamburger.  This casserole adds cheese to the recipe, and puts crescent rolls on top instead of putting the filling inside of the bread.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace the cabbage and ground beef into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring to crumble beef, until evenly browned and cabbage is tender. Drain off excess grease, and stir in the onion, garlic, and processes cheese. Scoop into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Unroll crescent roll dough, and place over the top of the dish. Pinch seams together to cover completely.\nBake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is puffed and browned.",
