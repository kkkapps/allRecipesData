    "des": "\"This is so easy, and since it's creamier than the store-bought versions of Irish creme liqueur, we prefer it. Drink a pinch as liqueur or use to make Irish coffees. One may add more Irish whisky for stronger flavor. Store in refrigerator for up to three weeks.\"",
    "ins": "Put chocolate chips and butter in a glass bowl; heat in microwave on high until chips are softened, about 30 seconds. Stir chocolate mixture until smooth, cooking in microwave another 15 seconds to assure chocolate is soft enough, if needed. Add Irish whiskey and stir until smooth.\nDissolve coffee granules in hot water in a small pitcher. Pour the chocolate mixture, sweetened condensed milk, and cream into the pitcher and stir until smooth.\nRefrigerate mixture until completely chilled, at least 20 minutes.",
