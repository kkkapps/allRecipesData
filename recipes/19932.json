    "ins": "Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch pieces.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add the potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes.\nSlice the bacon into small pieces and cook over medium high heat in a large, deep skillet until evenly brown. Do not overcook.\nChop the celery, green onions, stuffed olives and radishes into small pieces and put into a large bowl.  Add the potatoes and bacon and mix together.  Add the mayonnaise and lemon juice to taste, stir, and place in the refrigerator for a few hours to chill before serving.  You may want to add a few sliced hard boiled eggs on top.  ENJOY!!!",
