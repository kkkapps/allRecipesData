    "des": "\"This crusty, chewy, tangy bread can't be beat. You'll be shocked at how simple it is to create such a professional loaf at home. Glossy, crunchy crust. Resilient, airy crumb. Baking inside a Dutch oven (set in your kitchen oven) does an excellent job simulating the effects of a professional bread oven.\"",
    "ins": "Mix water and salt together in a very large bowl. Add sourdough starter and whisk vigorously to mix and aerate; stir in 3 cups bread flour until smooth. Stir in remaining 3 cups bread flour until dough is completely mixed.\nCover bowl and set aside until dough is bubbly and increased in volume, 12 to 15 hours.\nTurn dough on to a well floured work surface using floured hands. Turn dough several times to cover with flour. Return dough to an oiled bowl and let rest until dough is doubled in size but not risen enough to collapse, 2 to 3 hours.\nPreheat an oven-safe, lidded Dutch oven (at least 8 quarts) in a 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) oven for 30 minutes.\nCarefully remove Dutch oven using oven mitts and sprinkle cornmeal into the bottom to prevent dough from sticking.\nGently roll dough out of oiled bowl and into the Dutch oven; replace lid.\nBake in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove lid and continue baking until crust is lightly browned, about 15 minutes more. Carefully tip loaf out onto a cooking rack to cool completely.",
