    "des": "\"I made this delicious and rustic torta di riso with fresh spinach and leeks, but the recipe is a perfect catch-all for those abundant summer vegetables. Things like eggplant, peppers, beans, and squash all work beautifully. Just cut them kind of small, cook them tender, and let the rice, cheese, and eggs do the rest.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush a pie plate with 1 tablespoon olive and dust with 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\nHeat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir leeks with a pinch of salt in hot oil until leeks are soft and sweet, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir garlic into leeks and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.\nStir leek mixture, rice, spinach, 3/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, eggs, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Transfer spinach-rice mixture to the prepared pie dish and smooth the surface with a spatula; dust the top with remaining 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until torta is lightly browned around the outside and firm to the touch, 35 to 40 minutes.",
