    "ins": "Combine flour, wheat germ, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Set bowl aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the skim milk, melted margarine, eggs, and sugar. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients; stir in the wet ingredients, being careful not to over mix the batter. Gently fold in the chocolate chips.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until golden brown on the other side.",
