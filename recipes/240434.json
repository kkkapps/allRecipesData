    "des": "\"Came up with this for a more exotic twist on the classic bacon broccoli salad, since many of us are vegetarians.  Makes a great summer potluck dish, and a quick side to a world cuisine menu. Play with the type of curry powder you use to change up the base flavor.\"",
    "ins": "Mix broccoli, red bell pepper, cranberries, walnuts, and scallions together in a large bowl.\nWhisk mayonnaise, lime juice, vinegar, sugar, curry powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until smooth; pour over broccoli mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate salad until flavors blend, 2 hours to overnight. Toss well before serving.",
