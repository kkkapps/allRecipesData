    "des": "\"Very delicious rice pilaf with dried fruits, chicken, and nuts. Great way to liven up leftover chicken or pork. Also a wonderful dish for a vegetarian option if you omit the chicken.\"",
    "ins": "Bring 1 3/4 cups water and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in rice and seasoning packet; return to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork.\nHeat 3 tablespoons butter in a separate saucepan over medium heat. Add figs and currants; toss to coat. Cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add mango and water; cook and stir until mango is softened and dried fruit has absorbed water, about 5 minutes.\nStir cashews and half-and-half into fruit mixture; cook until sauce is thin and slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and blue cheese; cook until chicken is warmed and blue cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Serve over rice pilaf.",
