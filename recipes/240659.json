    "des": "\"I was headed to a Mardi Gras party and needed to throw something together fast. I had some raw peanuts on hand and decided to try candy coating them with a kick of Cajun seasonings added in. This is the result and they were a hit. 'Addictive' was the word most people used. Would be a great gift to give out during the holidays.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nStir sugar into water in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until the sugar dissolves completely. Add peanuts, chipotle chile powder, kosher salt, chili powder, and garlic powder into the liquid.\nBring the mixture to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid evaporates and the remaining syrup coats the nuts, about 15 minutes; spread immediately onto the prepared baking sheet. Use forks to separate any peanuts stuck together and to get an even layer.\nBake in preheated oven, stirring and then separating the peanuts every 5 minutes, until the peanuts are glazed, about 20 minutes total. Let peanuts cool completely before breaking into small pieces.",
