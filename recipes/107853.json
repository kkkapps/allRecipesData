    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.\nPlace the bread onto a baking sheet, and broil in the preheated oven until toasted on both sides. Remove and set aside. Meanwhile, place the baked beans in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and keep hot.\nHeat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the luncheon meat, and cook until it begins to brown on the edges, about 5 minutes; pour off any excess grease.\nTo assemble the beanwiches, spoon the beans over the toasted bread slices. Place the luncheon meat on top of the beans, layer with tomato slices, and finish with two slices of Cheddar cheese per sandwich.\nBroil in the preheated oven until the cheese has melted, 1 to 2 minutes.",
