    "des": "\"My husband's two favorite things are shrimp and quinoa. One night I combined the two into a fantastic 20-minute dish that tastes like a very light but flavorful fried rice. The recipe will serve 4 to 6 as a side dish, or makes two big bowls if served as a main. You can add ginger, extra veggies, chicken, ham...the possibilities are endless!\"",
    "ins": "Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa and place cover on saucepan. Reduce heat to low and cook quinoa at a simmer until the moisture is completely absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes.\nWhile the quinoa steams, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook green onions in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir corn into onions, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking until corn is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir the peas into the mixture and cook just until the peas are hot, 2 to 3 minutes.\nStir cooked quinoa into the shrimp mixture. Return heat to medium. Pour soy sauce and sesame oil over the mixture; cook and stir until completely hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle cilantro over the dish to serve.",
