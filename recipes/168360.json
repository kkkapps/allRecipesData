    "des": "\"Sweet, soft strawberry sorbet that will rival any brand bought in the grocery store.  Not being able to find the perfect recipe, I made up my own!  Most homemade sorbets resemble an icy slushie, but this one is thickened before freezing, yielding a melt-in-your-mouth treat that will please even the pickiest sorbet lover!  Dually great because it can be made in an ice cream freezer, or in your regular freezer.\"",
    "ins": "Place berries in the work bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Combine berry puree, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan. Heat until melted and just simmering. Whisk cornstarch into the cold water; stir into heated berry mixture. Remove from heat, and stir in lemon juice.  Cool slightly. Refrigerate berry mixture until cold, about 2 hours.\nFreeze in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.",
