    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\nCook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until crumbly and browned, about 10 minutes; drain grease.

Simmer ground beef mixture, stirring often, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.\nHeat chili beans in a saucepan over low heat until simmering.\nSpread layers of tortilla chips, ground beef mixture, and chili beans, respectively into a casserole dish; repeat layers until you run out of chips, beef, and beans. Top casserole with Cheddar cheese.\nBake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and tips of exposed tortilla chips are golden brown, about 15 minutes.",
