    "ins": "Toast sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over low heat until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Keep a close eye as they change color very quickly.\nCombine flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the flour mixture and add water, milk, melted butter, and olive oil; stir well until dough pulls together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.\nPlace dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nDivide dough in to 8 parts and roll each part into a 6- to 8-inch long rope. Join ends together and seal to form a ring. Place rings on prepared baking sheet, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 15 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush rings with beaten egg and sprinkle generously with toasted sesame seeds.\nBake in the preheated oven until golden and crusty, about 20 minutes.",
