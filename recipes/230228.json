    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\nLightly season hens with salt and black pepper to taste.\nMix rice, almonds, green onion, and 1/4 cup butter together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until rice is lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Add water, chicken bouillon, lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is cooked and water is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir parsley into rice mixture.\nStuff the cavity of each hen with rice mixture; truss the hens by securing the legs together with kitchen string. Place hens breast-side up in a shallow pan; loosely cover the pan with tented aluminum foil.\nRoast hens in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.\nMix currant jelly, Burgundy wine, 2 tablespoons butter, lemon juice, cornstarch, Worcestershire sauce, and allspice together in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until glaze is smooth and thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.\nUncover hens and brush with Burgundy glaze; continue roasting for 1 hour, brushing frequently with glaze. Drumsticks with move easily in sockets when done. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone of the hens and in the center of the stuffing should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer hens to a hot platter and serve with remaining glaze.",
