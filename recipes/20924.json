    "des": "\"This recipe produces a very red, shiny candied apple.  You can substitute a drop of cinnamon oil for the candies.  After the apples are cooled, you can wrap them in colored plastic wrap and tie shut with curling ribbon.  Makes a nice Halloween party treat.\"",
    "ins": "Insert a wooden craft stick into the bottom of each apple.  Butter a baking sheet and set aside.\nCombine sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Heat, without stirring, to 270 to 290 degrees F (132 to 143 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard but pliable threads.  Remove from heat and stir in candies and food coloring until just mixed.\nHolding each apple by its stick, quickly twirl in syrup, tilting pan to cover apple.  Lift out of syrup, turning to allow drips to adhere to apple.  Place apples on prepared baking sheet to cool completely.",
