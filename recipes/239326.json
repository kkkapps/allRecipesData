    "ins": "Prepare pork tenderloin first (recipe below).\nWhile pork is resting, prepare Idahoan(R) Baby Reds(R) Flavored Mashed Potatoes following package instructions.\nBlend in chevre cheese while potatoes are still warm.\nStir in mint and peas. Garnish with a few baby mint leaves.\nFor the pork tenderloin:  Mix together the garlic powder, chili powder, Italian seasonings, pepper and salt. Rub the seasonings all over the tenderloin. Or, season to taste with another flavoring of your choice. Heat a gas grill, turning all the burners to high until the grill is fully heated, 10 to 15 minutes.\nPut the pork on the hot grill grate. Close the lid and grill for 7 minutes. Turn the pork over, close the lid, and grill for another 6 minutes.\nTurn off the heat (keep the lid closed) and continue to cook the pork for another 5 minutes. At this point, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the thickest end of the tenderloin should read 145 degrees  to 150 degrees F. (If not, close the lid and let the pork continue to roast in the residual grill heat.)\nRemove the pork from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before carving. Cut across the grain into 1/2-inch slices and serve immediately.\nTo prepare in oven: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.\nPlace prepared roast in a foil lined shallow baking dish. Cook for 30 minutes, then test with an instant read thermometer to reach 145 to 150 degrees F.\nWhen pork is done, wrap in foil and let rest 10 minutes.\nCut across the grain into 1/2-inch slices, place three pieces on skewer and serve on top of the Idahoan Chevre Mashed Potatoes with Peas. Use drippings from the roast to drizzle on the roast when serving.",
