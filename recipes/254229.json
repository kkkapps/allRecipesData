    "des": "\"I was looking for a different way to cook zucchini blossoms that didn't involve gobs of cheese or deep-frying. So I made this up as I went along, and lo! Henceforth comes this recipe. You will need a food processor for this one.\"",
    "ins": "Chop 2 zucchini blossoms finely. Transfer to a bowl.\nStir tofu, feta cheese, olives, garlic, thyme, oregano, and seasoned salt into the bowl. Pour filling into a food processor; pulse until very crumbly. Increase speed blend until smooth and golden, about 3 minutes.\nPipe filling into remaining 6 blossoms using a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with the corner snipped off. Twist blossom ends carefully to seal in filling. Arrange on a plate; transfer to the freezer.\nMix whole wheat flour and egg substitute together in a bowl until batter is the consistency of pudding.\nSpread bread crumbs in a shallow dish.\nDip a stuffed blossom in batter and roll in bread crumbs. Repeat with remaining blossoms.\nSpray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. Cook blossoms until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes.",
