    "ins": "Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Coat pizza dough with spray and rosemary; place into the bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nSpray a baking sheet with cooking spray; lightly dust with cornmeal. Stretch the dough onto the sheet until it covers the bottom and dangles over the edge.\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\nMelt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix in flour until creamy. Add half-and-half; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 3 minutes. Add wine, Parmesan cheese, and hot sauce; cook and stir until thick and creamy, about 5 minutes. Remove sauce from heat; cool until just slightly warm, at least 8 minutes.\nSpread sauce onto the pizza dough to form a thin, even layer. Cover with pieces of crab meat; layer 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, zucchini, mushrooms, and olives on top. Cover with the remaining mozzarella cheese.\nBake pizza in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); bake until golden brown, 25 minutes more.",
