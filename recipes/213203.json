    "des": "\"I found this recipe years ago.  My first thought was that it was strange, but decided to keep it anyway.  I have made this many times since and it is one of the first appetizers to go!  It is simple enough for football parties or nice enough for cocktail parties.  Be careful when you slice the salami so that all the slices are on the same side.  The salami has a tendency to twist! Serve with crackers.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil.\nPartially slice the salami into 1/4-inch thick slices, making sure the cuts do not go all the way through.  Place the salami into the prepared baking dish, and bake for 1 hour. Drain off the grease.\nMix the barbecue sauce and brown sugar together in a bowl, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Pour about 2 cups of the sauce over the salami, and retain the rest for basting. Return the salami to the oven and bake for 45 minutes more, basting occasionally with the reserved sauce. Serve on a platter with a knife so guests can cut their own slices.",
