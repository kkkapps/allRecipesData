    "des": "\"This is our favorite classic chicken adobo using common ingredients. You may use a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. I prefer a thicker sauce like my dad would make but my family likes it brothy so they can pour it in their rice.\"",
    "ins": "Season chicken with black pepper.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir garlic in hot oil until fragrant. Sear chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Stir vinegar, peppercorn, and bay leaves into pot and bring to a boil.\nPour water and soy sauce into mixture and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until chicken is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. Stir in more water if sauce is too salty.",
