Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes.\nAdd the carrots, potato, cabbage and onions; cover and continue to simmer. Use kitchen string to tie the green beans into a bundle. Add them to the pot, cover and continue to cook until the carrots and potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes.\nTo serve, remove pork to a serving dish. Arrange vegetables around it. Allow the pork to rest about 10 minutes before slicing.",
