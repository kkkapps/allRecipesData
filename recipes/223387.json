    "des": "\"My backwoods Mississippi grandmother loves to can her own sweet pickles! Here's how she does it! My grandmother stresses that you shouldn't leave them unrefrigerated for more than four or five hours, or they may not keep. She says it's easy and very good! My grandmother rotates the can by turning it upside down every other day, then back over. Within about a week, the pickles will be sweet and delicious!\"",
    "ins": "Stir sugar and cider vinegar together in a large bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Add pickle slices and stir to coat. Pour into a jar and seal. Store in refrigerator, flipping the jar daily, for 1 week.",
