    "des": "\"A simple and delicious way to serve sausage and peppers with a tomato-based sauce. This is one of my husband's and kids' favorite meals. They like it served over rice because it makes a lot of 'gravy' that soaks into the rice. It 's one of my favorites because it's quick, easy, and has only a few ingredients that I usually have on hand.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread sausage pieces into a baking dish.\nBake sausage in preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.\nStir sausage with the onion. Pour tomato sauce over the sausage mixture; bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.\nStir bell pepper into the mixture to coat in tomato sauce; cook until the bell pepper is tender, about 20 minutes more.",
