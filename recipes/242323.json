    "des": "\"This is a great salad for picnics or potlucks! This version of broccoli salad uses more vinegar and less mayonnaise than most recipes. This gives you a slightly different, healthier option when choosing your next side dish. It's best if you wait until right before serving to add the dressing to keep bacon crisp.\"",
    "ins": "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Tear bacon into small pieces.\nCombine broccoli, bacon, sunflower seeds, and green onions in a bowl.\nWhisk mayonnaise, vinegar, and sugar together in a bowl; pour over broccoli mixture and toss to coat.",
