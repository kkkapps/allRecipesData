    "des": "\"This is a delicious martini that goes down easily...maybe too easily.  The butterscotch schnapps adds a delicious dessert quality to the drink. Sometimes for extra fancy presentation, I melt a handful of chocolate chips in the microwave, and then rim the martini glass with the melted chocolate.  Then, place the glass mouth-side down on parchment paper and place in the freezer.  This gives the glass a candy rim and gives each sip extra chocolate flavor.\"",
