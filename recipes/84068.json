    "des": "\"This pizza is made with a combination of all your favorite breakfast foods, such as sausage, cheese, hash browns, and eggs. Top with thinly sliced red, yellow and green bell peppers for a beautiful (and tasty!) presentation.\"",
    "ins": "Preheat oven to 375 F. Separate crescent rolls into sixteen triangles. Place in two ungreased 12 inch rimmed pizza pans with points toward the center. In each pan, press rolls together, seal perforations and form a circle 1 inch larger in diameter than bottom of pan. Turn edges under to make a slight rim.\nSprinkle cooked sausage evenly over each crust. Top with potatoes; add peppers and/or green onions, if desired. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Combine eggs, milk, salt and pepper in small bowl: stir well. Pour half of the egg mixture evenly over each pizza. Sprinkle with Parmesan.\nBake for 15-20 minutes or until eggs are set and crusts are golden.",
