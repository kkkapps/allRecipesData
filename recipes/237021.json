    "des": "\"Delicious sweet coconut rice that can be thrown in a rice cooker or done on the stove. This is great when paired with a Thai green curry or stir-fry! Ideally, make this with either jasmine rice or long-grain white rice.\"",
    "ins": "Stir rice, coconut milk, and water together in a saucepan. Dissolve sugar into the liquid.\nBring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice, 15 to 20 minutes. Leaving saucepan on the burner, turn heat off and let rice steam until sticky, about 5 to 10 minutes more.  Garnish with shredded coconut.",
