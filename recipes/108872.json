    "ins": "Preheat the oven's broiler to 500 degrees; set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Combine the balsamic vinegar and the garlic in a small bowl; reserve.\nRoll the salmon strips, beginning on the thickest side, into 6 pinwheels. Secure with wooden skewers. Drizzle the balsamic and garlic mixture generously over each pinwheel.\nPlace salmon under hot broiler and cook for 7 minutes. Turn pinwheels over; cook until edges are brown, and fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 7 additional minutes. Sprinkle with pepper before serving.",
