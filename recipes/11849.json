    "ins": "In a large pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook the spaghetti 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. In a bowl, mix the Romano cheese, mozzarella cheese, and provolone cheese. In a separate bowl, blend the melted margarine and garlic powder.\nCover the bottom of the prepared dish with 1/3 of the cooked spaghetti, top with 1/3 of the cheese mixture, and drizzle with 1/3 margarine mixture. Repeat layering. Be sure to end with cheese on top. (If you really like garlic you can sprinkle between layers as desired.)\nBake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is bubbly and lightly brown.",
