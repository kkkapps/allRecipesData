Wrap each pepper with a piece of bacon to enclose the filling, and secure with a toothpick.\nPlace peppers in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until the bacon is crisp on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly and serve.\nTo make the dip, place the sour cream in a bowl, and mix with any leftover cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate until needed.",
