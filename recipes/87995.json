    "des": "\"This is something I just hacked together based on the desire for pork and apples. I made fresh taglitelle with durum semolina and eggs, but you can substitue pretty much any pasta you like, although I'd recomend the strand variety. The garlic is optional, as I don't think it added too much.\"",
    "ins": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.\nPlace the apples, shallot, basil, and red wine in a blender, and puree.\nHeat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork chops in the skillet, season with nutmeg and pepper, and sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. Cook about 4 minutes, then mix in onion and garlic. Continue cooking 4 minutes, or to desired doneness.\nMix sun-dried tomatoes, broccoli, and red bell pepper into the skillet. Continue cooking until broccoli is tender. Stir in the apple mixture, and cook until heated through. Serve over the cooked pasta.",
