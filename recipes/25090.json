    "des": "\"One of the quickest, tastiest bar cookie recipes I've used. You can alter the taste by changing fruit preserve flavors. It's a perfect cookie to bring to any pot luck function, but make sure you bring the recipe too, people will ask for it!\"",
    "ins": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.\nIn a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Cut in the shortening until the mixture is coarse and crumbly. Stir in the egg.  I use my hands to mix it all together, it just seems easier. Press about half of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread the raspberry preserves over the crust then sprinkle with the remaining crumb mixture.\nBake for about 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly toasted. Careful not to overcook. Cool in the pan on a wire rack. Then cut into squares, enjoy!",
