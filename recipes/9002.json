    "des": "\"From Singapore, I am sending you a Chinese dish made with chicken wings, filled with the aroma of sesame oil which makes it totally irresistible. If possible, cook in a clay pot. Also, sliced potatoes can be added to make a hearty meal. Serve with rice or bread if desired.\"",
    "ins": "Cut the chicken wings into 3 separate portions. In a large skillet, combine the chicken, water, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, garlic and green onion. Stir together and cook for 15 minutes over medium heat.\nAdd the 1/4 cup sesame oil and simmer for another 15 minutes over low heat. Bring mixture to a boil and add dash of sesame oil. Remove from heat, let cool and serve.",
