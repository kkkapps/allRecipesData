Add about 2 inches of cold water and sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper.\nCover the saucepan and place over high heat. When you see steam escaping from the lid (no peaking!) immediately reduce flame to low and cook the potatoes about 20-22 minutes or until fork tender.\nDrain any excess water from the potatoes and place back on heat to dry (30 seconds). Using a potato masher or ricer; mash potatoes until smooth. Add chicken broth and yogurt and continue to mash. Season potatoes, add chives and serve with roasted meats or chicken. Potatoes can be kept warm in a very low oven (275 degrees F.) or dotted with butter and reheated in a 350 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes.",
