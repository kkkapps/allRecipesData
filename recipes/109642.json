    "des": "\"My Grandma used to make this chicken and it was my mom's favorite. It is very easy, quick, flexible, and delicious. You may add as many different veggies and any amount you want. The broth made from this is great to dip bread and butter; my brother loves to have it as soup. Yum!!!\"",

Pour water into pan to a level of about 1/2 inch.\nCover pan with foil and cook 1 hour in the preheated oven.
