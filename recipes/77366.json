    "des": "\"This is a recipe from my Polish grandmother. It is a semi-sweet bread that tastes wonderful with a little butter. I grew up on this stuff and it has always been one of my favorites.\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and eggs. Stir in the milk and oil, and mix in the baking soda. Place honey in a small pot, and bring to a boil. Stir honey into the bowl. Mix flour into the bowl. Fold in the raisins and walnuts. Stir by hand with a sturdy spoon for 10 minutes. Allow the dough to sit 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease four 8x4 inch loaf pans.\nFill each loaf pan with about 2 inches of the batter. Bake 1 hour 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean. Bread will be brown in color and will crack on top.",
