    "des": "\"This hummus recipe was perfected after a weekend of experimentation. Everyone that has tried it has loved it! Several people have said it's the best they've tasted. It tastes best if the beans and lemon juice sit first, but if you're in a hurry everything can be blended together without waiting. To serve, create wells in the hummus and drizzle with olive oil and ground paprika. If desired, garnish with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, and Greek olives for a festive salad/dip with pita bread.\"",
    "ins": "Place garbanzo beans, 1 1/2 tablespoon reserved aquafaba, and lemon juice in a food processor. Let soak until flavors combine, about 15 minutes.\nPulse soaked garbanzo beans until roughly chopped. Add tahini, olive oil, garlic, cayenne, sugar, salt, and black pepper; blend, thinning with reserved aquafaba, until hummus is smooth and reaches desired consistency.",
