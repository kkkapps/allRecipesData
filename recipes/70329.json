    "des": "\"These are the easiest hamantashen I've ever made! They are a bit sweet, roll out easily and are consumed quickly! My kids don't want to give them to their friends! Traditional fillings are prune and poppy seed. You can use any canned pie filling, whole fruit jelly, chocolate chips, or any type filling your family likes! Be creative with these- we put mini chocolate chips in the dough!\"",
    "ins": "In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the orange juice and vanilla. Mix in the baking powder, then gradually stir in the flour until the dough forms a ball. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. I like to do mine overnight.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 3 inch circles using a cookie cutter or drinking glass. Place circles on the prepared cookie sheets. Spoon 1 teaspoon of filling onto the center of each circle. (Any more and it will ooze out) Pinch the sides of each circle to form a triangle, covering as much of the filling as possible. The cookies may be frozen on the cookie sheets if desired to help retain their shape while cooking.\nBake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until light golden brown. These are best undercooked slightly. Cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.",
