    "des": "\"Quinoa with various veggies and a zesty (and easy) vinaigrette that makes a wonderful salad dressing for any salad.  I used one English cucumber instead of 2 normal cucumbers because we prefer the taste. Cook the quinoa with the water as you would normal rice (works in a rice cooker as well).\"",
    "ins": "Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Scrape the cooked quinoa into a large bowl and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.\nPlace the vinegar, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and mustard into a blender. Drizzle in the oil while blending at high speed until the dressing is thick.\nAdd the cucumbers, bell pepper, red onion, tomato, and olives to the bowl with the quinoa. Pour the dressing overtop and gently fold until evenly mixed.",
