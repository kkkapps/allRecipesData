    "ins": "Place the carrots in a saucepan with enough water to cover and cook over medium heat until nearly boiling, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately drain the carrots and set aside to cool.\nDivide the cooled carrots into two 1-quart glass jars. Alternate layers of onion and jalapeno peppers atop the carrots until the jars are full.\nMix the liquid from the jalapeno peppers and the vinegar in a saucepan; bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Remove from heat and pour the liquid into the jars until full. Seal the jars with lids. Place the jars in the refrigerator until cold, at least 8 hours.",
