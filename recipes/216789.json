    "ins": "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nCombine the pancake mix, butter, and sugar; mix until crumbly. Stir in 2/3 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and mix until fully incorporated. The dough will be sticky.\nDrop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto the baking sheet, spacing the dough about 2 inches apart. With the back of a teaspoon, make a shallow indentation in the center of each dough ball. Fill the centers with a teaspoon of jam.\nBake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow the pastries to cool.\nCombine the confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons of milk, vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and mix until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the Danish.",
