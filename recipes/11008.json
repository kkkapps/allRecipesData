Add egg, rum, and vanilla and beat until well blended.\nSift flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt into small bowl.  Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Mix in toffee and chopped almonds.\nDrop batter by heaping tablespoonfuls onto heavy large ungreased baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.  Bake until cookies puff slightly and crack on top but are still soft to tough, about 11 minutes.  Let cookies cool on sheet 1 minutes.  Transfer cookies to rack and cool completely.  Repeat shaping and baking with remaining batter.",
