    "ins": "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray and coat with bread crumbs.\nCombine egg yolks, confectioners' sugar, applesauce, and margarine in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in almond flour, rye flour, and baking powder slowly. Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the milk into the batter.\nBeat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites into the batter. Fold in raisins.\nPour most of the batter into the prepared pan, reserving 3/4 cup batter in the bowl. Add reserved 2 tablespoons milk and cocoa powder to the bowl; stir until smooth. Drizzle over the batter in the pan. Trace over the batter with a spatula to create a marbled effect.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.",
