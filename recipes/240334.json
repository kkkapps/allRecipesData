    "des": "\"This was so delicious. I couldn't get over how quick and easy it was with such a well blended flavor. My husband tried to go back for a 3rd bowl but I put it up so we could have leftovers for the next day. If you like it a little thicker, stir a couple tablespoons of cornstarch into cold water and whisk into boiling soup for a couple minutes to thicken.  Personally, the sour cream, cheese and chips thickened it enough for me. Hubby went back for seconds so he ate it too quick to even notice. Top with blue corn tortilla chips, sour cream, and shredded Mexican-style cheese.\"",
