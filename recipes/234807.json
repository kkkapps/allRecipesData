    "ins": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.\nSift flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a large mixing bowl until combined.\nPlace butter and sugar into the work bowl of a large stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Scrape down attachment and bowl. Add eggs into butter-sugar mixture, one at a time, mixing the first egg in thoroughly before adding the second. Scrape down sides of bowl as you work.\nBeat buttermilk and vinegar into moist ingredients, followed by vanilla extract and red food coloring. Mix until color is even.\nPour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and gently whisk by hand until batter is smooth. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.\nBake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let sit in the pan for 10 minutes; remove cupcakes from pan and cool completely on a cooling rack before frosting. Unwrap cupcakes before frosting.",
